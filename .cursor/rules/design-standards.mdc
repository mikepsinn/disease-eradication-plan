# Design Standards

**Design Philosophy: Minimalism Above All**

Charts should be as simple and powerful as possible. Every element must earn its place.

## Key Requirements

**Color Palette:** Black and white only for maximum authority, timelessness, and accessibility.

**Chart Format:** Must be `.qmd` files with Python code blocks that generate PNG outputs.

**File Naming:** `[topic]-[comparison/metric]-[type]-chart.qmd` (e.g., `military-spending-vs-medical-research-column-chart.qmd`)

**PNG Generation:** Every QMD chart file MUST generate a corresponding PNG file for presentations, social media, and version control.

**Typography:** Use serif fonts (Georgia, Times New Roman) for authority, monospace (Courier New) for data precision.

**Mobile-First:** Prefer column charts over bar charts for better mobile readability.

**What to Remove:** Gridlines, legends, backgrounds, borders, shadows, gradients, 3D effects, decorative elements.

**What to Include:** Chart title (mandatory), data bars/columns, key data values, watermark.
