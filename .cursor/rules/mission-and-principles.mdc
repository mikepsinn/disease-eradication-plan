# Mission and Core Principles

This project documents "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ending War and Disease" - a book about getting every nation to sign the **1% Treaty** to redirect 1% of military spending to cure diseases instead of cause them.

**Key Mission:** Save millions of lives by making curing people more profitable than killing them.

**Core Focus:** The unnecessary suffering and death from war (14M deaths/year) and disease (55M deaths/year). Every year we lose 69 million lives that could be saved.

**The Solution:** Redirect just 1% of military spending to medical research through systems that are 80X more efficient than current approaches.

For complete mission details and principles, see: [MISSION_AND_PRINCIPLES.md](mdc:GUIDES/MISSION_AND_PRINCIPLES.md)

**Key Principles:**
- Anchor all strategic arguments in Public Choice Theory
- Be specific about goals: redirect 1% of global military spending toward curing disease
- Frame solutions as incentive engineering, not moral appeals
- Use history wisely to show committee-based systems fail in complex domains
- Be concise, direct, and quantify everything
