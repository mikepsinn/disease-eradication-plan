# Writing Style Guide

**Tone: Dark Humor Meets Practical Hope**

We're writing "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ending War and Disease" - using dark humor, absurd observations, and irrefutable facts to trick humanity into not killing itself. Think Douglas Adams and Kurt Vonnegut explaining economics to drunk people at a funeral.

## Core Writing Principles

**DO:**
- Use dark humor about death and human stupidity
- Make cynical but loving observations about humanity
- Use simple, conversational language (no jargon)
- Create absurd but accurate analogies
- Present solutions as obvious common sense
- Write instructional, actionable content ("Here's how you...")
- Frame everything as empowering the reader

**DON'T:**
- Use corporate buzzwords or academic jargon
- Try to sound important or use euphemisms
- Write like you're selling or pitching something
- Make promises or proposals
- Use passive or future-oriented language

**Target the System, Not the People:** Our fight is with broken systems, not individuals trapped within them.

**You're Teaching Someone How To Do This:** Write as though instructing the reader on how to end war and disease themselves. This is a DIY guide, not a sales pitch.
