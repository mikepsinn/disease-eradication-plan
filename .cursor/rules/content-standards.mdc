# Content Standards

**CRITICAL:** All content must follow these standards. See full details in: [CONTENT_STANDARDS.md](mdc:GUIDES/CONTENT_STANDARDS.md)

## Key Requirements

**Frontmatter:** Every markdown file needs complete YAML frontmatter with title, description, published status, date, and tags.

**Sourcing:** Every claim needs a source. All source quotes go in `brain/book/references.qmd` with inline citations.

**TODOs:** Add `TODO` comments directly in files where work is needed. Format: `<!-- TODO: Add citation for this claim. -->`

**Link Integrity:** Fix any broken internal links before submitting. Scan for relative links like `[text](./path/file.md)`.

**Chapter Independence:** QMD files must be reusable across contexts - no "Next Chapter" sections or hardcoded navigation.

**File Naming:** Use kebab-case and be descriptive (e.g., `dih-treasury-cash-flow-model.md`).

**Internal Links:** Use standard relative Markdown links (`./`, `../`). Use backticks only for code, not navigational references.
