# Technical Standards

## Development Environment

**Quick Start:** Run `.\setup.ps1`, activate with `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`, verify with `.\verify-setup.ps1`, preview with `quarto preview index.qmd`

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+, Quarto, PowerShell (Windows)

## Technical Standards

**Code:** Write new tools in TypeScript
**Dependencies:** Use `npm` and include a `package.json`
**Execution:** Run TypeScript directly with `tsx`. No compiled `.js` files in the repo.
**Automated Formatting:** All `.qmd` files are subject to automated formatting checks

## Troubleshooting

- **"ModuleNotFoundError"**: Run `.\verify-setup.ps1` to check your environment
- **"Kernel not found"**: Re-run the Jupyter kernel registration step
- **Quarto errors**: Make sure your virtual environment is activated
