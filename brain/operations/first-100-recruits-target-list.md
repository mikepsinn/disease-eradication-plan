## The First 10 (Start Here)

If you can only recruit 10 people in Month 1, make it:

1. **One billionaire** with health loss (Mark Cuban most accessible)
2. **One defense defector** (use network to find anonymous insider)
3. **One frustrated scientist** (rare disease researcher)
4. **One EA leader** (Will MacAskill or OpenPhil)
5. **One journalist** (Derek Thompson or Ezra Klein)
6. **One politician** (Ro Khanna most aligned)
7. **One crypto leader** (Vitalik or Naval)
8. **One patient advocate** (CF Foundation or ALS)
9. **One podcast host** (Tim Ferriss or Lex Fridman)
10. **One of your personal network** who has 1,000+ followers and gives a shit

These 10 become your "advisory board" even if informal. Each should bring 10 more.

## Outreach Templates

### Template 1: The Billionaire Pitch

```
Subject: A $1B bet on curing disease (and 270% returns)

[NAME],

I'm reaching out because you lost [FAMILY MEMBER] to [DISEASE].

I'm sorry. I know money doesn't fix that. But maybe it can prevent
10 million similar losses.

I'm building a mechanism to redirect 1% of global military spending
($27B/year) to medical research. Not charity—an investment structure
that returns 270% annually to early backers.

The catch: We need $1B to lobby every country to sign the treaty.

I think you're one of ~50 people on Earth who could single-handedly
fund this. And one of ~10 with personal reasons to.

Would you give me 15 minutes to show you the math?

[YOUR NAME]
[CALENDAR LINK]

P.S. The pitch deck is here: [LINK]
```

---

### Template 2: The Scientist Pitch

```
Subject: Fund the research NIH rejected

Dr. [NAME],

I saw your grant application to NIH for [SPECIFIC PROJECT] was rejected.

Their loss. Our gain.

I'm building dFDA—a decentralized platform that funds trials NIH
considers "too risky." Which usually means "too innovative."

We're launching with $27B/year from a 1% military spending treaty.

Your research on [TOPIC] is exactly what we'd fund.

Interested in:

1. Getting funded through dFDA?
2. Advising on our trial protocols?
3. Both?

15-minute call? [CALENDAR LINK]

[YOUR NAME]
```

---

### Template 3: The Journalist Pitch

```
Subject: Story pitch: The treaty to end death

[NAME],

Quick pitch:

What if we could redirect 1% of military spending to cure disease?

- $27B/year unlocked
- Zero countries lose strategic advantage (everyone cuts simultaneously)
- Investors make 270% returns
- Diseases actually get cured

Sounds impossible. The math says otherwise.

I've built the financial model, the governance structure, and the
global referendum platform to make it happen.

Would you be interested in:

1. Exclusive first coverage?
2. Interview for [YOUR PUBLICATION]?
3. Co-authoring the analysis?

Live platform: [LINK]

Let me know.

## Success Metrics

### Week 1-2

- [ ] Identify specific names for all 100 targets
- [ ] Find warm intro paths for top 25
- [ ] Craft customized outreach for top 10
- [ ] Send first 10 messages

### Week 3-4

- [ ] 50% response rate from top 10 (5 responses)
- [ ] 1 commitment to support (advisor, investor, or advocate)
- [ ] That 1 person brings 3 more

### Month 2

- [ ] 20 of top 100 have responded
- [ ] 5 have committed
- [ ] Those 5 have brought 15 more

### Month 3

- [ ] 50 of top 100 engaged
- [ ] 15 committed
- [ ] Network effects kicking in (getting inbound from their networks)

---

## What "Committed" Means

A recruit is "committed" when they've done at least ONE of:

1. **Invested** - Committed capital to VICTORY Bonds (even $1K)
2. **Advised** - Joined advisory board (even informally)
3. **Amplified** - Shared referendum with their audience (tweet, article, podcast)
4. **Connected** - Made 3+ warm intros to other high-value targets
5. **Created** - Contributed content, code, or research

---

## The Multiplier Effect

If you recruit the right first 100:

- **Each brings 10 more** → 1,000 total
- **Those bring 10 more** → 10,000 total
- **Those bring 10 more** → 100,000 total (viral threshold)
- **At 3.5% of 8B** → 280,000,000 (victory condition)

**But:** It only works if your first 100 are the right 100.

One billionaire = 100 randos
One journalist = 1,000 randos
One politician = 10,000 randos

**Choose wisely. Recruit relentlessly.**

---
