## How to Siphon Money from Rich People's Tax Shelters

*(A Grant Application Playbook for Revolutionaries)*

Here's how you navigate the absurd theater of grant applications to fund the War on Disease. The nonprofit world is a strange place where foundations (tax shelters for the wealthy) give money to charities (people who are good at filling out paperwork) to solve problems that never seem to go away.

Your job is to become exceptionally good at the paperwork part. This playbook provides the strategy, templates, and tracking systems to do just that.

## The Situation: You're Broke, They're Not

- **You have:** A world-changing plan, zero cash, and a website that's lying about being able to take donations.
- **They have:** Billions of dollars they are legally required to give away each year to maintain their tax-exempt status.

Your mission is to bridge this gap.

## The System: An Airtable Grant-Tracking Base

First, you need to expand your `DIH Command & Control` Airtable base to manage this process. Add the following tables.

### Table 1: `Grant Pipeline` (The Master Tracker)

*Tracks every application from fantasy to reality (or rejection).*

- `Grant ID` (Autonumber)
- `Foundation` (Link to `Foundations & Funders`)
- `Grant Name / Program` (Text) - e.g., "Innovation in Global Health Grant"
- `Status` (Single Select):
  - `Prospecting` (They look promising)
  - `Drafting Application` (Writing compelling lies)
  - `Submitted` (In the mail)
  - `Pending` (They're ignoring us)
  - `Awarded` (They fell for it!)
  - `Rejected` (They saw through it)
  - `Reporting Due` (Now we have to prove we did something)
- `Amount Requested` (Currency)
- `Amount Awarded` (Currency)
- `Submission Deadline` (Date)
- `Decision Date` (Date)
- `Primary Contact` (Link to `Personnel Roster`)
- `Application Docs` (Attachments) - Your final submitted lies
- `Notes` (Long Text)

### Table 2: `Foundations & Funders` (The Rich List)

*A directory of every organization you plan to hit up for money.*

- `Foundation Name` (Text, Primary Key)
- `Website` (URL)
- `Primary Contact` (Link to `Personnel Roster`)
- `Focus Areas` (Multiple Select) - e.g., Global Health, Tech for Good, Democracy
- `Status` (Single Select): `Active Prospect`, `Past Funder`, `Do Not Approach`
- `Typical Grant Size` (Currency)
- `Application Process` (Long Text) - "Invite only," "Online portal," etc.
- `Relationship History` (Link to `Engagements`)

## The Battle Plan: A 4-Step Process

### Step 1: Intelligence Gathering (Find Your Targets)

Your first job is to build a list of foundations that might be crazy enough to fund you.

**How to find them:**

1.  **Google is your friend:** Search for "foundations funding global health," "grants for medical innovation," "funding for political advocacy."
2.  **Spy on similar organizations:** Find a nonprofit you admire/hate and look up who funds them (they usually list this on their website to brag).
3.  **Use the tools:** If you had money (which you don't), you'd use services like Foundation Directory Online or GrantStation. For now, stick to Google.

**What to look for:**

-   **Mission Alignment:** Do they use words like "transformative," "systemic change," or "high-risk, high-reward"?
-   **History:** Have they ever funded something that wasn't incredibly safe and boring?
-   **Size:** Is their typical grant size big enough to be worth your time?

**Your Action:** Populate the `Foundations & Funders` table with at least 50 prospects.

### Step 2: Define the "Ask" (What Are You Selling?)

You are not asking for money to "end disease." That's too big and scary. You are asking for money to fund a very specific, measurable project:

**The Project: The Global Referendum Campaign**

This is the perfect "ask" for a grant because it's a discrete project with a clear goal.

**Your Budget (The $1B War Chest Breakdown):**

You're asking for a slice of this pie. Tailor your ask to the foundation's size.

-   **For a small foundation ($50k ask):** "Fund our social media campaign in Southeast Asia for one year."
-   **For a medium foundation ($500k ask):** "Fund the development of our referendum voting platform and its security audit."
-   **For a large foundation ($5M ask):** "Fund our entire lobbying and media effort in the EU for two years."

**Your Action:** Create a one-page project summary for the Global Referendum Campaign that you can customize for each application.

### Step 3: The Paperwork (How to Write a Winning Proposal)

Every grant application is basically the same five documents dressed in different clothes.

1.  **Cover Letter:** A one-page summary. "Dear Rich Person, We're ending death. Your money will help. Here's our plan. Give us money. Sincerely, The Future."
2.  **Executive Summary:** The same thing, but with more paragraphs.
3.  **Statement of Need:** This is where you shine. Use the stats from **Part I of the OUTLINE.MD**.
    -   "150,000 people die daily from preventable diseases."
    -   "Humanity spends $2.7 trillion on war and just $68 billion on cures."
    -   "The system is broken. Here are the charts to prove it."
4.  **Project Description:** Explain the Global Referendum.
    -   The 3.5% rule.
    -   The viral growth strategy.
    -   The Wishocracy app.
5.  **Budget:** A detailed breakdown of how you'll waste their money. Be specific.
    -   `$10,000` - Facebook Ads
    -   `$25,000` - Lobbyist retainer
    -   `$5,000` - Pizza for volunteer developers

**Your Action:** Create a template for each of these documents in a shared drive.

### Step 4: Submit and Track (The Waiting Game)

1.  **Submit the application:** Follow their ridiculous instructions to the letter. If they want it in a 10.5-point font on beige paper, you do it.
2.  **Update Airtable:** Move the card in your `Grant Pipeline` from `Drafting` to `Submitted`. Set a reminder for the `Decision Date`.
3.  **Follow up:** Send a polite email a week after the deadline.
4.  **Get Rejected:** 90% of the time, you will be rejected. Don't take it personally. They probably funded a study on the mating habits of squirrels instead. Update Airtable to `Rejected` and move on.
5.  **Get Accepted:** On the rare occasion you succeed, celebrate for five minutes. Then, update Airtable to `Awarded` and immediately create tasks for all the reporting requirements you now have to fulfill.

## Marching Orders

1.  **Build the Airtable tables** as defined above.
2.  **Start prospecting.** Find 50 foundations and add them to your base.
3.  **Write the project summary** for the Global Referendum Campaign.
4.  **Draft the template documents.**
5.  **Pick your top 5 prospects and start writing.**

This is your new reality. You are no longer a revolutionary. You are a professional beggar with a fancy title. But if you do it right, you'll beg your way to a fully funded war on death. Now get to work.
