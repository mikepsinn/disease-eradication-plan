Humanity has a spending problem. We blow **$119 trillion every year** on two things: killing each other ($9.7T) and dying from preventable diseases ($109.1T). Meanwhile, we spend just $68 billion on medical research - that's 0.06% of the problem.

But here's the kicker: Even that tiny research budget is wasted by the NIH's Soviet-style central planning. Two hundred bureaucrats in Bethesda decide which diseases get cured based on politics, not science. It's like having the DMV run Silicon Valley.

## The Chapters

### [Evolution Trapped Us](./problem/the-evolutionary-trap.qmd)
**Still Running Caveman Software on Space-Age Hardware**

We're biologically programmed to choose war over medicine. Our brains evolved to bash rivals with rocks, not cure cancer.

### [The Cost of War](./problem/cost-of-war.qmd)
**$9.7 Trillion Per Year on Humanity's Most Expensive Hobby**

Not just the bombs and bullets, but the refugees, the PTSD, the blown-up hospitals. Every cruise missile that could have been a cancer lab.

### [The Cost of Disease](./problem/cost-of-disease.qmd)
**$109.1 Trillion Annual Slow-Motion Apocalypse**

The real killer isn't war, it's biology. Cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's - they're eating us alive while we argue about border walls.

### [The NIH Has Not Instituted Health](./problem/nih-spent-1-trillion-eradicating-0-diseases.qmd)
**Soviet-Style Science Wastes $48B/Year**

The National Institutes of Health is Gosplan for medicine. Two hundred reviewers reject 90% of grant applications while 95% of diseases have zero treatments.

### [The FDA is Unsafe and Ineffective](./problem/fda-is-unsafe-and-ineffective.qmd)
**Central Planning Takes 17 Years to Approve a Drug**

That's not safety - that's mass murder by bureaucracy. Every day of delay is 30,000 preventable deaths.

### [Regulatory Capture](./problem/regulatory-capture.qmd)
**How Pharma Bought the Refs**

The companies being regulated write the regulations. It's like letting the mafia run the FBI.

### [Democracy Can't Fix This](./problem/unrepresentative-democracy.qmd)


## The Bottom Line

We're spending **$119 trillion per year** to stay sick and violent while the cure sits right in front of us. The problem isn't money - it's that we let bureaucrats allocate it instead of markets.
