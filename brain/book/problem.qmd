We spend **$2.72 trillion** every year on stuff designed specifically to make humans stop being alive. Meanwhile, we spend $68 billion on medical research. That's **40 times less** on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses.

Humanity has a spending problem. We blow **$119 trillion every year** on two things: killing each other ($9.7T) and dying from preventable diseases ($109.1T). Meanwhile, we spend just $68 billion on medical research - that's 0.06% of the problem.

Even that tiny research budget is wasted by the NIH's Soviet-style central planning.
