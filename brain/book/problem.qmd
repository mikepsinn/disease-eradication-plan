Humanity has a spending problem. We blow **$119 trillion every year** on two things: killing each other ($9.7T) and dying from preventable diseases ($109.1T). Meanwhile, we spend just $68 billion on medical research - that's 0.06% of the problem.

But here's the kicker: Even that tiny research budget is wasted by the NIH's Soviet-style central planning. Two hundred bureaucrats in Bethesda decide which diseases get cured based on politics, not science. It's like having the DMV run Silicon Valley.

## The Chapters

### [1.1 Evolution Trapped Us in Violence](./problem/the-evolutionary-trap.qmd)
We're still running caveman software on space-age hardware. Our brains evolved to bash rivals with rocks, not cure cancer. This chapter explains why we're biologically programmed to choose war over medicine.

### [1.2 The Cost of War: Humanity's Most Expensive Hobby](./problem/cost-of-war.qmd)
**$9.7 trillion per year** - that's what we spend on our collective murder fetish. Not just the bombs and bullets, but the refugees, the PTSD, the blown-up hospitals. Every cruise missile that could have been a cancer lab.

### [1.3 The Cost of Disease: A Slow-Motion Apocalypse](./problem/cost-of-disease.qmd)
**$109.1 trillion per year** - the real killer isn't war, it's biology. Cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's - they're eating us alive while we argue about border walls. This chapter shows the true scale of the massacre.

### [1.4 The NIH: How Soviet-Style Science Wastes $48B/Year](./problem/nih-spent-1-trillion-eradicating-0-diseases.qmd)
The National Institutes of Health is Gosplan for medicine. Two hundred reviewers reject 90% of grant applications while 95% of diseases have zero treatments. This is what happens when committees replace markets.

### [1.5 The FDA: Central Planning's Body Count](./problem/fda-is-unsafe-and-ineffective.qmd)
It takes 17 years and $2.2 billion to approve a drug. That's not safety - that's mass murder by bureaucracy. Every day of delay is 30,000 preventable deaths. The FDA is a serial killer with a government pension.

### [1.6 Regulatory Capture: How Pharma Bought the Refs](./problem/regulatory-capture.qmd)
The companies being regulated write the regulations. It's like letting the mafia run the FBI. This chapter shows how Big Pharma turned the FDA into its personal bodyguard.

### [1.7 Democracy's Failure: Why Voters Can't Fix This](./problem/unrepresentative-democracy.qmd)
Voters are idiots (including you and me). We can't understand our own blood tests, let alone biomedical research policy. Democracy fails when the problems are smarter than the voters.


## The Bottom Line

We're spending **$119 trillion per year** to stay sick and violent while the cure sits right in front of us. The problem isn't money - it's that we let bureaucrats allocate it instead of markets.
