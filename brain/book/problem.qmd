150,000 people die every day from preventable diseases. That's fifty 9/11s. Every. Single. Day.

Your parent, child, or friend is statistically likely to be one of them. We could prevent most of these deaths with existing technology. But we're too busy spending $2.7 trillion on weapons.

This isn't a funding problem. It's a priorities problem.

## Humanity's  Budget

Picture humanity as a family making $100,000 a year. Here's how we spend it:

- **Healthcare treatment:** $8,200 (treating symptoms after we're sick)
- **Military spending:** $2,700 (home defense)
- **Medical research:** $68 (finding actual cures)

We spend **40X more on weapons than cures**. We spend **115X more treating disease than curing it**.

On a pie chart, the research slice is literally invisible. You need a magnifying glass.

{{< include ../figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The numbers are obscene:

- **$2.7 trillion/year** on killing each other
- **$109.1 trillion/year** lost to disease (treatment + lost productivity)
- **$68 billion/year** on finding cures

One fighter jet costs more than all rare disease research combined. The military's toilet seats cost more than malaria research. Viagra got more funding than Alzheimer's.

We've tried **0.0001%** of the 166 billion possible treatment combinations. Your rare disease kid has better odds with lottery tickets.

## The System Is Working As Designed (To Not Work)

Here's the brutal truth: The system isn't broken. It's working exactly as designed. And it's designed to keep you sick and broke.

**The NIH: $1 Trillion to Eradicate 0 Diseases**

Since 1970, the National Institutes of Health has spent over $1 trillion (inflation-adjusted). Diseases eradicated: **ZERO**. Smallpox was the WHO, not NIH. Success rate: 0.00%.

200 bureaucrats decide which of 10,000 diseases matter. Yours doesn't. They fund what gets published, not what saves lives. Result: 55 million die annually while papers get published.

**The FDA: Making Medicine 82X More Expensive**

Oxford's RECOVERY trial proved treatments can cost $500 per patient. The FDA demands $41,000 per patient. That's **82 times more expensive** for the same result.

- **💸 ~$2.2 Billion** to develop one new treatment.
- **🐢 17 years** from discovery to patient.
- **🚫 85% of patients** are forbidden from trials.
- **💊 95% of rare diseases** have NO approved treatments.
- **🙈 Negative results are hidden**, wasting billions on repeated failures.
- **🧫 44 years** since we last eradicated a disease.

Your rare disease child? Better odds with lottery tickets. The system is designed to prevent lawsuits, not save lives.

**Democracy Is Theater**

Princeton University proved it: There's a **0% correlation** between what you want and what policies get enacted. Economic elites get what they want 78% of the time. You get what you want 0% (unless elites agree).

Your "representative" has 750,000 constituents. You get 0.00013% of their attention. They spend 70% of their time fundraising, not representing.

**Regulatory Capture: The Foxes Own Every Henhouse**

- FDA run by ex-pharma executives
- DoD run by future defense contractors
- The revolving door: 400% salary increase for playing ball

Every "failure" is someone's success story:
- FDA delays = Pharma profits (17 years of patent monopoly)
- Military spending = Defense contractor wealth (the point)
- Disease continues = Healthcare profits ($4.5T industry needs you sick)

## The Fixed Pie Reality

You can't print your way out of this. Earth has 8 billion brains - can't print more.

When the Fed prints money for war, defense contractors buy up the smartest people. Medical research funding up **10X in dollars**, but **DOWN as % of GDP**. Every MIT grad building missiles is NOT curing cancer.

The brain drain: Raytheon pays $150k, NIH pays $55k. Guess where geniuses go.

Switzerland proves the alternative works: 0.7% on defense → $93K GDP per capita (highest quality of life on Earth).
