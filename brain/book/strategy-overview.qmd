This isn't a protest. It's a business plan for acquiring humanity's priorities through a marketplace transaction. The product is a longer, healthier life. The market being disrupted: that curious human tradition of spending more on dying than living. The strategy is a simple, three-step algorithm for suggesting that the current arrangement might not be optimal.

## Step 1: Acquire Capital

Raise **$1.0B** by selling **[VICTORY Bonds](economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**. The pitch: a perpetual **271.8% annual return**, funded by redirecting a tiny fraction of the global war machine's budget. The returns substantially exceed comparable investments.

## Step 2: Align Incentives

Use the capital to launch a **[global referendum](strategy/global-referendum.qmd)** and compensate the public for their participation. The goal: get **280 million people** (3.5% of the global population) to vote YES. This isn't a petition; it's a gentle reminder that voters exist. History shows that no government on earth can withstand the sustained attention of 3.5% of its population.

## Step 3: Execute the Transition

Use the public mandate and the remaining capital to **[fund political support for the treaty](legal/election-law.qmd)**. With 280 million voters and a budget roughly comparable to defense lobbying expenditures, supporting the treaty becomes the rational choice for any politician interested in remaining employed.

The result follows logically: the **[1% Treaty](solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** is ratified. The $27.2B-a-year river of cash is unlocked. Forever.

This isn't a revolution. It's merely suggesting humanity try not dying quite so much.
