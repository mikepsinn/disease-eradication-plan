## The 82X Cost Multiplier: Two Systems, Two Outcomes

The Oxford RECOVERY trial tested COVID treatments on 47,000 patients for **\$500 per patient** ([source](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-efficiency)).

The FDA-regulated system averages **\$41,000 per patient** ([source](../references.qmd#fda-trial-costs)).

That's **82X more expensive**.

The RECOVERY trial found dexamethasone saves lives.
Time from start to result: 3 months.
FDA average time to approve a new drug: 12 years.

That's **48X slower**.

Combined inefficiency: 82 × 48 = **3,936X less efficient overall**.

These aren't estimates.
These are documented outcomes from actual trials.

## How We Got Here: The 1962 Disaster - When FDA Centralization Destroyed Medical Progress

This wasn't always the case.

**Pre-1962: The Decentralized System That Worked**
- 144,000 physicians ran real-world trials through JAMA
- Peer-reviewed, doctor-prescribed, patient-decided
- Life expectancy gains: Linear 4-year increase every single year

**1962: FDA Centralization - Immediate Disaster**

Then came the Kefauver Harris Amendment of 1962.
In response to the Thalidomide disaster (which happened in Europe, not the US), Congress centralized efficacy trials under the FDA.

The results were immediate and catastrophic:
- **New drug approvals dropped 70%** overnight
- **Drug costs exploded: \$74M to \$2.6B today** (35X more expensive)
- **Timeline: 2-3 years to 17 years** to market
- **Life expectancy gains slowed by more than half**

**2020: Oxford RECOVERY Proves Decentralization Still Works**
- \$500 per patient vs \$41,000 FDA standard (82X cheaper)
- Included real sick patients FDA would reject
- Found dexamethasone saves lives in 3 months

The proven inefficiency: FDA trials are 82X more expensive than necessary.

The system isn't just broken; we have a receipt for the exact moment we broke it.

## The \$2.6 Billion Price Tag for Aspirin

Here's what it actually costs to get FDA approval for a new drug:

- **Average cost:** \$2.6 billion ([source](../references.qmd#drug-development-costs))
- **Average time:** 10-15 years
- **Success rate:** 12% make it through trials

Fun fact: If we had today's FDA in 1897, aspirin would still be in Phase II trials.
"We need to test if it works on headaches in left-handed people born on Tuesdays."

17 years from discovery to patient (while you die waiting).

[95% of diseases have ZERO approved treatments](../references.qmd#fda-untreated-diseases-95pct).

Your rare disease child has better odds with lottery tickets.

Designed to prevent lawsuits, not save lives.

## The Actual Death Toll (With Real Math)

The FDA's own economists calculated that delays in drug approval cost lives:

- **Beta-blockers delay:** Gieringer (1985) estimated 10,000+ excess deaths per year during the decade-long delay
- **Total beta-blocker deaths:** ~100,000 Americans ([source](../references.qmd#beta-blocker-deaths))

That's more Americans than died in Vietnam and Korea combined.
From one drug delay.

## The Incentive Structure: A Masterpiece of Misalignment

**FDA Regulator Decision Tree:**

**Approve drug that later shows problems:**
- Congressional hearing (televised)
- "FDA APPROVED KILLER DRUG" headlines
- Career ends
- Pension threatened

**Delay drug that could save lives:**
- Nothing happens
- Dead people don't complain
- Promotion on schedule
- Retire to pharma job

This isn't conspiracy.
It's economics.
The FDA literally cannot make mistakes of commission (approving bad drugs) but faces zero consequences for mistakes of omission (delaying good drugs).

## Clinical Trial Theater: Excluding 85% of Reality

FDA trials systematically exclude ([source](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-exclusions)):
- Patients over 65 (most people who need drugs)
- Patients under 18 (all children)
- Pregnant women (50% of women sometimes)
- Anyone with comorbidities (everyone sick)
- Anyone on other medications (everyone old)

**Result:** Test drugs on the 15% of unusually healthy sick people, then act shocked when they don't work on actual patients.

It's like testing car safety using only crash test dummies, then being surprised when real humans with bones have different outcomes.

## The Negative Results Black Hole

Here's a fun fact that should be criminal:

- **Negative trial results published:** 37% ([source](../references.qmd#publication-bias))
- **Positive trial results published:** 94%
- **Money wasted repeating failed experiments:** ~\$100 billion annually

Companies are literally allowed to hide when drugs don't work.
It's like casinos only having to report when people win.

## Countries That Don't Have Our "Safety"

**Japan's Regenerative Medicine Act:**
- Conditional approval after Phase II
- Real-world data collection required
- Time to patient: 2-3 years
- Americans fly there for treatment

**EU Compassionate Use:**
- Terminal patients can access experimental drugs
- Doctor's discretion, not bureaucrat's
- Thousands of lives extended
- FDA: "But what if they die?" (They're already dying)

**Right to Try (US):**
- Passed despite FDA opposition
- FDA response: Made it effectively impossible to use
- Patients helped: <200 total
- Patients who wanted help: Tens of thousands

## The COVID Test Fiasco: A Case Study in Excellence

Timeline of FDA's COVID response:
- **January 2020:** WHO develops test, world starts using it
- **February 2020:** FDA blocks all non-CDC tests
- **Late February:** CDC tests contaminated, don't work
- **March:** Private labs begging to test, FDA says no
- **Late March:** FDA finally allows other tests
- **Cost:** Unknown thousands of preventable deaths

The FDA's defense: "We were ensuring quality." 
The CDC's tests literally didn't work.
You can't ensure quality of nothing.

## Solutions That Would Work (But Never Will)

**Reciprocal Approval:** If EU/UK/Japan/Canada approves it, we approve it
- Lives saved: Thousands annually
- FDA response: "But their standards might be 0.01% different!"

**Provisional Approval:** Let dying people try experimental drugs
- Current system: Die safely
- Proposed system: Maybe die, maybe live
- FDA logic: Death is preferable to uncertainty

**Outcome-Based Approval:** If it works in real patients, approve it
- Current: Does it work in cherry-picked trial patients?
- Better: Does it work in actual sick humans?
- FDA: "That's not how we've always done it"

## The Bottom Line: Safety Theater

The FDA doesn't make drugs safe.
It makes them:

- Expensive (\$2.6 billion)
- Slow (12+ years)
- Inaccessible (95% of rare diseases have zero treatments)
- Ineffective (tested on wrong populations)

It's security theater but for medicine.
The TSA of healthcare.
Except when TSA fails, your flight is delayed.
When FDA fails, you die.

But at least the bureaucrats are safe from blame.
And isn't that what really matters?

*P.S. - The FDA will likely object to this chapter. Estimated time for their formal response: 12-15 years, pending Phase III review.*
