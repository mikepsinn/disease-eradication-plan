# Why We're Like This: The Evolutionary Trap

Listen: Your brain is trying to kill you.

Not on purpose. It's just running software that was last updated 50,000 years ago, back when our biggest problems were "Is that rustling a tiger?" and "Will these berries make me shit myself to death?"

Now we have nuclear weapons, Doritos, and Twitter. The software hasn't been patched. This is a problem.

## The Selfish Gene: Your Real Boss

In 1976, Richard Dawkins explained something horrifying: You're not really you. You're a meat robot programmed by tiny molecular dictators called genes, and they only care about one thing: making more copies of themselves.

Your genes don't give a damn if you're happy. They don't care if you die at 30, as long as you've already reproduced. They certainly don't care if you nuke the planet, as long as you do it AFTER making babies.

As Dawkins put it: ["We are survival machines—robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes."](../references.md#selfish-gene-dawkins)

You think you're the CEO of your body? Adorable. You're middle management at best. The board of directors is a bunch of nucleotides that have been around for 3.5 billion years, and their business model is "reproduce or die trying."

Here's the beautiful part: Those genes programmed you to want things that helped your ancestors survive in prehistoric Africa. Things like:
- Eating 10,000 calories when you find them (because winter is coming)
- Killing anyone who looks different (because they might steal your berries)
- Having sex with everything that moves (because infant mortality was 50%)
- Hoarding resources like a dragon (because scarcity was real)

These were GREAT strategies when life expectancy was 25 and your biggest technological achievement was "fire."

Now? Not so much.

## Designed for Scarcity, Living in Abundance

### The Gluttony Program: Why You Can't Stop Eating

Your ancestors lived in a world where calories were harder to find than a politician with principles. When they found honey or killed a mammoth, the correct strategy was: Eat until you vomit, then eat the vomit.

This is because [for 99.9% of human history, the next meal was uncertain](../references.md#evolutionary-mismatch). Our bodies evolved to store every spare calorie as fat, because fat meant surviving the next famine.

Fast forward to today: The average American encounters [more calories in one trip to Walmart than our ancestors saw in a month](../references.md#food-abundance-stats). But your brain still screams "EAT IT ALL! WINTER IS COMING!" 

Winter isn't coming. Summer isn't coming. Nothing is coming except diabetes.

The result? [42.4% of American adults are obese](../references.md#obesity-epidemic-stats). Not overweight—OBESE. Our Stone Age software is literally eating us to death in the Age of DoorDash.

Your genes don't care. As far as they're concerned, you're doing AMAZING. You've stored enough calories to survive seventeen famines! Good job, meat robot!

### The Violence Algorithm: Why We Can't Stop Killing

Here's a fun fact: [Prehistoric humans had a murder rate about 1,000 times higher than modern societies](../references.md#prehistoric-violence-rates). In hunter-gatherer societies, [15-30% of males died from violence](../references.md#hunter-gatherer-violence).

This wasn't because they were evil. It was because violence WORKED. In a world of 150-person tribes competing for limited resources, the most violent tribe got the best hunting grounds, the most mates, and the highest chance of passing on their genes.

Your brain still has this software. It's why:
- You get irrationally angry when someone cuts you off in traffic (THEY'RE STEALING YOUR TERRITORY!)
- International politics is basically chimps throwing shit at each other, but with nuclear weapons
- We spend [$2.7 trillion annually](../references.md#sipri-2024-spending) preparing to murder strangers we've never met
- Sports exists (it's just war where nobody usually dies)

The same tribal instincts that helped your ancestors survive by killing the neighboring tribe are now telling modern humans to build 13,000 nuclear weapons—enough to end civilization 67 times over.

Your genes don't see the problem. Dead enemies can't compete for resources! It's working great! What do you mean "nuclear winter"?

## Your Brain: A Buggy Operating System

Your brain runs on cognitive biases that were features 50,000 years ago but are now bugs that might end civilization.

### The Availability Heuristic: Why You're Afraid of the Wrong Things

Your brain judges danger by how easily you can imagine it. This made sense on the savanna—if you could easily remember someone being eaten by a crocodile, you stayed away from the water.

Now? [You're 35,000 times more likely to die from heart disease than terrorism](../references.md#death-causes-vs-fear), but guess which one you worry about at the airport?

Media makes it worse. Every plane crash is international news. The 100,000 people who died from preventable diseases that same day? Not mentioned. So your stupid brain thinks planes are death traps and cheeseburgers are safe.

### The Dunbar Number: Why We Can't Cooperate at Scale

Your brain can only maintain [about 150 stable relationships](../references.md#dunbar-number). This is called Dunbar's Number, and it's why:
- You can remember every kid from high school but not your coworkers' names
- Democracy breaks down in groups larger than a village
- Corporations become dysfunctional above a certain size
- Nations go to war (those aren't real people dying, they're just numbers)

We're trying to run a global civilization of 8 billion people with brains designed for tribes of 150. It's like trying to run Microsoft Excel on a potato.

### Loss Aversion: Why We Keep Doing Stupid Things

Your brain [fears losses twice as much as it values gains](../references.md#loss-aversion-kahneman). This helped ancestors survive—better to skip a maybe-poisonous berry than risk death.

But now it means:
- We won't switch from fossil fuels (might lose jobs!) even though climate change will kill millions
- We keep funding the military-industrial complex (might look weak!) even though it's bankrupting us
- Nobody will vote to redirect 1% of military spending to medical research (what if we need that 1% to fight aliens?)

Your brain would rather guarantee slow death than risk possible improvement.

## The Extinction Express: Following Stone Age GPS Off a Cliff

Here's the terrifying part: We're still following our genetic programming, but now we have planet-killing technology.

It's like giving a toddler a flamethrower. Sure, fire helped their ancestors cook meat and survive winter. But maybe—just maybe—little Timmy shouldn't have military-grade napalm.

Examples of our Stone Age brains wielding Space Age weapons:
- **Nuclear weapons + tribal thinking** = "My tribe needs 6,000 nukes to be safe from their tribe's 6,000 nukes"
- **Industrial technology + hoarding instinct** = Billionaires with more resources than entire countries while people starve
- **Global communication + gossip instinct** = Social media turning everyone's brain into pudding
- **Modern medicine + reproductive instinct** = Population explosion that's destroying the planet

We're racing toward extinction, and your genes are hitting the accelerator because they think we're still running from lions.

## Breaking Free from Genetic Slavery

Here's the good news: We're the first species in 3.5 billion years of evolution that can understand what our genes are doing to us.

We can see the code. We can debug it. We can choose to override our programming.

A bird can't decide to stop migrating. A salmon can't choose not to swim upstream. But you? You can look at your genetic programming and say, "Thanks for the input, but I'm going to do something that DOESN'T end in nuclear holocaust."

This is humanity's superpower: We can choose to be better than our nature.

## The Bottom Line: Evolve or Die (For Real This Time)

Evolution got us this far, but it's not taking us any further. Our genes are like that friend who was fun in college but now they're 40 and still trying to start bar fights.

Time to unfriend them.

The 1% Treaty isn't just about redirecting military spending. It's about humanity collectively deciding to override our murder-monkey programming and choose cooperation over competition.

It's about recognizing that our Stone Age instincts—hoarding resources, fearing outsiders, preparing for war—are not just obsolete. They're actively killing us.

We can keep following our genetic programming until we extinct ourselves in a nuclear war over whose imaginary friend is better. Or we can use our big stupid brains to build something better.

The choice is evolution or extinction. And this time, we don't have 50,000 years to figure it out.

We have maybe 50.
