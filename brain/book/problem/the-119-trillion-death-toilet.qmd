## Shock #1: We Spend 40X More on Killing Than Curing

Let's start with what they admit to:

{{< include ../../figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-column-chart.qmd >}}

### Breaking It Down Per Human

**PER HUMAN BEING ON EARTH:**

- Military spending: **$337.50**/year
- Medical research: **$8.50**/year
- Ratio: **39.7:1** in favor of DEATH

**PER SECOND:**

- Military: **$85,571**
- Medical: **$2,155**
- We could fund an entire clinical trial every second with military money

## Shock #2: The REAL Cost of War ([$9.7 Trillion](../references.qmd#total-military-and-war-costs-9-7t))

But that [$2.7 trillion](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)? That's just what they ADMIT to spending.

Here comes the part they don't tell you:

### What $9.7 Trillion Actually Means

#### THE $9.7 TRILLION REALITY CHECK

• Per second: **$307,594**
• Per human: **$1,212.50**/year
• Could fund **194,000** Oxford RECOVERY trials
• Could develop **3,731** new drugs
• Could cure approximately **ALL** diseases several times over

**Instead we chose to:**
• Build machines that kill people
• Destroy cities
• Create refugees
• Traumatize soldiers
• Accomplish literally nothing positive

## Shock #3: Disease Makes War Look Like a Bargain ([$109 Trillion](../references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t))

You thought $9.7 trillion for war was insane?

**MEET THE REAL KILLER:**

## The $119T Death Toilet

So when you add it all up:

- **War**: $9.7T
- **Disease**: $109T
- **TOTAL**: $119T flushed down the toilet every year

That's more than the entire global GDP. Humanity spends more on death and suffering than it produces in value.

### Meanwhile, Our Investment in Cures

{{< include ../../figures/military-vs-medical-spending-ratio-bar-chart.qmd >}}

## Breaking Down the $109 Trillion Disease Burden

### DISEASE COST BREAKDOWN (billions)

• Heart Disease: **[$2,100B](../references.qmd#disease-cost-heart-disease-2100b)** (1.9%)
• Cancer: **[$1,800B](../references.qmd#disease-cost-cancer-1800b)** (1.7%)
• Mental Illness: **[$1,600B](../references.qmd#disease-cost-mental-illness-1600b)** (1.5%)
• Diabetes: **[$1,500B](../references.qmd#disease-cost-diabetes-1500b)** (1.4%)
• Alzheimer's: **[$1,300B](../references.qmd#disease-cost-alzheimers-1300b)** (1.2%)
• Respiratory: **[$900B](../references.qmd#disease-cost-respiratory-900b)** (0.8%)
• Kidney Disease: **[$600B](../references.qmd#disease-cost-kidney-disease-600b)** (0.6%)

### DISEASE ECONOMICS

• Daily Disease Cost: **$298 BILLION**
• Hourly Disease Cost: **$12.4 BILLION**
• Per Second: **$3.4 MILLION**
• Per Human Per Year: **$13,625**
• % of Global GDP: **[15%](../references.qmd#disease-burden-as-pct-of-gdp)**

## The Per-Second Reality

### THE DEATH TOILET IN REAL-TIME

**While you've been reading this chapter (3 minutes):**

- War costs: **$55,366,920**
- Disease costs: **$622,087,080**
- Cure investment: **$387,900**

**TOTALS:**

- TOTAL WASTED: **$677,454,000**
- TOTAL ON SOLUTIONS: **$387,900**

**RATIO: 1,747:1** waste vs solutions

## What $119 Trillion Could Buy Instead

### IF WE REDIRECTED THE $119 TRILLION

• **2,380,000** Oxford RECOVERY trials
• **45,769** New drug developments
• **2,479** Years of NIH budget
• **1,190** Moon bases
• **238** Mars colonies
• **5,950** Nuclear fusion plants
• **30** Years of free healthcare for Earth
• **119** Years of free education for everyone

### OR MORE REALISTICALLY

• Cure every disease
• End aging
• Achieve biological immortality
• Make death optional
• Have $100 trillion left over

## The Investment Ratio That Defines Insanity

### THE $119T DEATH TOILET

• We flush **$326 billion** down it daily
• That's **$14 billion** per hour
• That's **$227 million** per minute

**CURE RESEARCH GETS: 0.06% of that**

**RATIO: 1,750:1** (death spending vs cure spending)

## The Bottom Line

1. **Military Spending**: $2.7T (what they admit)
2. **Real War Cost**: $9.7T (including destruction)
3. **Disease Burden**: $109T (the real apocalypse)
4. **Total Death Cost**: $119T (8% war, 92% disease)
5. **Cure Investment**: $68B (0.06% of problem)

**Translation**: We spend 1,750 times more dealing with death than preventing it.

## This Is Not Sustainable

We're on an exponential curve. Disease costs rise 3-5% annually. Military spending grows to match "threats". Meanwhile cure funding stays flat.

**10 years from now**:

- Disease burden: $150T
- War costs: $12T
- Cure funding: Still $68B

**20 years from now**:

- Disease burden: $200T+
- Society collapses under healthcare costs
- Too late to fix

## But Here's the Beautiful Part

**We only need 1% of the death toilet to fix everything.**

$119T × 1% = $1.19T for cures

That would be:

- 17X increase in cure funding
- Enough to cure most diseases in a decade
- Enough to reverse aging
- Enough to make death optional

Instead of a 1,750:1 ratio of death to cures...
We'd have a 99:1 ratio.

Still insane, but survivable.

## The Final Stupidity Ratio: 1,750-to-1

**We spend 1,750 times more money causing or mopping up death than preventing it.**

| What We Buy | Annual Cost | Translation for Idiots |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Death Toilet** | | |
| Disease (watching people rot) | $109.1 Trillion | Everyone you love slowly dissolving while you pay to watch |
| War (professional murder) | $9.7 Trillion | Turning children into skeletons for fun and profit |
| **Total Death Toilet** | **$118.8 Trillion** | **More than Earth's entire GDP, somehow** |
| | | |
| **Things That Don't Kill Us** | | |
| Houses | [$23.0 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-real-estate-market-size) | Boxes to die in (at least they have WiFi) |
| Cars & Planes | [$8.0 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-transportation-market-size) | Metal tubes to die in (but faster) |
| Food | [$9.0 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-food-market-size) | Fuel for your meat robot |
| Teaching Kids | [$6.0 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-education-market-size) | How to read death certificates |
| Roads & Internet | [$4.0 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-infrastructure-market-size) | Infrastructure for dying while browsing |
| **Actually Curing Diseases** | **[$0.068 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-gov-med-research-spending)** | **A rounding error. LOL.** |

If humanity's budget was a family making $100,000/year:

- Healthcare (treating symptoms): $8,200
- Military (home defense): $2,700
- Medical research (finding cures): **$68**

That's like buying 1,600 mops instead of fixing the burst pipe.
