## Shock #1: We Spend 40X More on Killing Than Curing

Let's start with what they admit to:

{{< include ../../figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-column-chart.qmd >}}

### Breaking It Down Per Human

**PER HUMAN BEING ON EARTH:**

- Military spending: **$337.50**/year
- Medical research: **$8.50**/year
- Ratio: **39.7:1** in favor of DEATH

**PER SECOND:**

- Military: **$85,571**
- Medical: **$2,155**
- We could fund an entire clinical trial every second with military money


## Shock #3: Disease Makes War Look Like a Bargain ([$109.1 Trillion](../references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t))

You thought $11.4 trillion for our species' most violent hobby was insane? That's just the opening act.

**MEET THE REAL KILLER:**

## The $120.5T Death Toilet

So when you add it all up:

- **War**: $11.4T (the cost of actively killing each other)
- **Disease**: $109.1T (the cost of passively watching each other rot)
- **TOTAL**: $120.5T flushed down the toilet every single year

That's more than the entire global GDP. Humanity officially spends more on death and suffering than it produces in value. Congratulations, we've achieved negative progress.

### Meanwhile, Our Investment in Cures

## The Per-Second Reality

### THE DEATH TOILET IN REAL-TIME

**While you've been reading this chapter (3 minutes):**

- War costs: **$65,064,960**
- Disease costs: **$622,767,420**
- Cure investment: **$388,080**

**TOTALS:**

- TOTAL WASTED: **$687,832,380**
- TOTAL ON SOLUTIONS: **$388,080**

**RATIO: 1,772:1** waste vs solutions

## What $120.5 Trillion Could Buy Instead

### IF WE REDIRECTED THE $120.5 TRILLION

• **2,410,000** Oxford RECOVERY trials
• **46,346** New drug developments
• **2,510** Years of NIH budget
• **1,205** Moon bases
• **241** Mars colonies
• **6,025** Nuclear fusion plants
• **30** Years of free healthcare for Earth
• **120** Years of free education for everyone
• **An army of 1.5 billion healers.** You could hire nearly every person in China, pay them $80,000 a year, and tell them their only job is to end sickness forever.

### OR MORE REALISTICALLY

• Cure every disease
• End aging
• Achieve biological immortality
• Make death optional
• Have $100 trillion left over to figure out what to do with all the extra time. (Bonus: people who aren't dying from preventable diseases are surprisingly more productive. The economy gets a shot in the arm instead of the patient.)

## The Investment Ratio That Defines Insanity

### THE $120.5T DEATH TOILET

• We flush **$330 billion** down it daily
• That's **$14 billion** per hour
• That's **$230 million** per minute

**CURE RESEARCH GETS: 0.06% of that**

**RATIO: 1,772:1** (death spending vs cure spending)

## The Bottom Line

1. **Military Spending**: $2.7T (what they admit)
2. **Real War Cost**: $11.4T (including destruction and other cosmic stupidities)
3. **Disease Burden**: $109T (the quiet, boring, and much larger apocalypse)
4. **Total Death Cost**: $120.5T (9% war, 91% disease)
5. **Cure Investment**: $68B (0.06% of the problem)

**Translation**: We spend 1,772 times more dealing with death than preventing it. It's like trying to mop up the ocean instead of turning off the faucet.

## This Is Not Sustainable

We're on an exponential curve of idiocy. Disease costs rise 3-5% annually. Military spending grows to match whatever "threats" we can invent this week. Meanwhile, cure funding stays flatter than a pancake on a steamroller.

**10 years from now**:

- Disease burden: $150T
- War costs: $12T
- Cure funding: Still a pathetic $68B

**20 years from now**:

- Disease burden: $200T+
- Society collapses under the weight of its own hospital bills
- Too late to fix

## But Here's the Beautiful Part

**We only need 1% of the death toilet to fix everything.**

$120.5T × 1% = $1.21T for cures

That would be:

- An 18X increase in cure funding
- Enough to actually cure most diseases in a decade
- Enough to reverse aging
- Enough to make death optional

Instead of a 1,772:1 ratio of death to cures...
We'd have a 99:1 ratio.

Still clinically insane, but survivable.

## The Final Stupidity Ratio: 1,772-to-1

**We spend 1,772 times more money causing or mopping up death than preventing it.**

| What We Buy | Annual Cost | Translation for Idiots |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Death Toilet** | | |
| Disease (watching people rot) | $109.1 Trillion | Everyone you love slowly dissolving while you pay to watch |
| War (professional murder) | $11.4 Trillion | Turning children into skeletons for fun and profit |
| **Total Death Toilet** | **$120.5 Trillion** | **More than Earth's entire GDP, somehow** |
| | | |
| **Things That Don't Kill Us** | | |
| Houses | [$23.0 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-real-estate-market-size) | Boxes to die in (at least they have WiFi) |
| Cars & Planes | [$8.0 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-transportation-market-size) | Metal tubes to die in (but faster) |
| Food | [$9.0 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-food-market-size) | Fuel for your meat robot |
| Teaching Kids | [$6.0 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-education-market-size) | How to read death certificates |
| Roads & Internet | [$4.0 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-infrastructure-market-size) | Infrastructure for dying while browsing |
| **Actually Curing Diseases** | **[$0.068 Trillion](../references.qmd#global-gov-med-research-spending)** | **A rounding error. LOL.** |

To put it another way: if humanity's entire ~$100 Trillion global economy was a family's $100,000 annual income, here's how our priorities would look:

- Healthcare (treating symptoms): $8,200
- Military (home defense): $2,700
- Medical research (finding cures): **$68**

That's like buying 1,600 mops instead of fixing the burst pipe.
