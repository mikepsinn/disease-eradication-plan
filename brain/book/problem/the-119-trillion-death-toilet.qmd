## Shock #1: We Spend 40X More on Killing Than Curing

Let's start with what they admit to:

{{< include ../../figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-comparison.qmd >}}

### Breaking It Down Per Human

```{python}
#| echo: false
military_per_human = 2700_000_000_000 / 8_000_000_000
medical_per_human = 68_000_000_000 / 8_000_000_000

print(f"PER HUMAN BEING ON EARTH:")
print(f"├─ Military spending: ${military_per_human:.2f}/year")
print(f"├─ Medical research: ${medical_per_human:.2f}/year")
print(f"└─ Ratio: {military_per_human/medical_per_human:.1f}:1 in favor of DEATH")

print(f"\nPER SECOND:")
print(f"├─ Military: ${2700_000_000_000/365/24/3600:,.0f}")
print(f"├─ Medical: ${68_000_000_000/365/24/3600:,.0f}")
print(f"└─ We could fund an entire clinical trial every second with military money")
```

## Shock #2: The REAL Cost of War ($9.7 Trillion)

But that $2.7 trillion? That's just what they ADMIT to spending.

Here comes the part they don't tell you:

{{< include ../../figures/war-real-hidden-costs-breakdown.qmd >}}

### What $9.7 Trillion Actually Means

```{python}
#| echo: false
real_war_cost = 9_700_000_000_000

print("THE $9.7 TRILLION REALITY CHECK:\n")
print(f"• Per second: ${real_war_cost/365/24/3600:,.0f}")
print(f"• Per human: ${real_war_cost/8_000_000_000:,.2f}/year")
print(f"• Could fund {real_war_cost/50_000_000:,.0f} Oxford RECOVERY trials")
print(f"• Could develop {real_war_cost/2_600_000_000:,.0f} new drugs")
print(f"• Could cure approximately ALL diseases several times over")
print(f"\nInstead we chose to:")
print(f"• Build machines that kill people")
print(f"• Destroy cities")
print(f"• Create refugees")
print(f"• Traumatize soldiers")
print(f"• Accomplish literally nothing positive")
```

## Shock #3: Disease Makes War Look Like a Bargain ($109 Trillion)



You thought $9.7 trillion for war was insane?

**MEET THE REAL KILLER:**

{{< include ../../figures/disease-war-curing-costs-column-chart.qmd >}}

## The $119 Trillion Death Toilet

So when you add it all up:
- **War**: $9.7T
- **Disease**: $109T
- **TOTAL**: $119T flushed down the toilet every year

That's more than the entire global GDP. Humanity spends more on death and suffering than it produces in value.

### Meanwhile, Our Investment in Cures

{{< include ../../figures/military-vs-medical-spending-ratio-bar-chart.qmd >}}

## Breaking Down the $109 Trillion Disease Burden

```{python}
#| echo: false
# Disease cost breakdown
disease_costs = {
    'Heart Disease': 2100,
    'Cancer': 1800,
    'Diabetes': 1500,
    'Alzheimer\'s': 1300,
    'Respiratory': 900,
    'Kidney Disease': 600,
    'Mental Illness': 1600,
    'All Others': 99200
}

total = sum(disease_costs.values())

print("💀 DISEASE COST BREAKDOWN (billions):\n")
for disease, cost in sorted(disease_costs.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
    pct = (cost / total) * 100
    if disease != 'All Others':
        print(f"• {disease}: ${cost:,}B ({pct:.1f}%)")

print(f"\n📊 DISEASE ECONOMICS:")
print(f"• Daily Disease Cost: $298 BILLION")
print(f"• Hourly Disease Cost: $12.4 BILLION")
print(f"• Per Second: $3.4 MILLION")
print(f"• Per Human Per Year: $13,625")
print(f"• % of Global GDP: 15%")
```

## The Per-Second Reality

```{python}
#| echo: false
import time

# Real-time cost counter
print("⏱️ THE DEATH TOILET IN REAL-TIME:\n")
print("While you've been reading this chapter:\n")

war_per_second = 9_700_000_000_000 / 365 / 24 / 3600
disease_per_second = 109_000_000_000_000 / 365 / 24 / 3600
cure_per_second = 68_000_000_000 / 365 / 24 / 3600

reading_time = 180  # Assume 3 minutes to read this far

print(f"💣 War costs: ${war_per_second * reading_time:,.0f}")
print(f"💀 Disease costs: ${disease_per_second * reading_time:,.0f}")
print(f"💊 Cure investment: ${cure_per_second * reading_time:,.0f}")
print(f"\n📊 TOTAL WASTED: ${(war_per_second + disease_per_second) * reading_time:,.0f}")
print(f"🔬 TOTAL ON SOLUTIONS: ${cure_per_second * reading_time:,.0f}")
print(f"\n😵 RATIO: {((war_per_second + disease_per_second) / cure_per_second):,.0f}:1 waste vs solutions")
```

## What $119 Trillion Could Buy Instead

```{python}
#| echo: false
total_waste = 119_000_000_000_000

print("🌟 IF WE REDIRECTED THE $119 TRILLION:\n")

alternatives = [
    ("Oxford RECOVERY trials", 50_000_000, "trials"),
    ("New drug developments", 2_600_000_000, "drugs"),
    ("Years of NIH budget", 48_000_000_000, "years"),
    ("Moon bases", 100_000_000_000, "bases"),
    ("Mars colonies", 500_000_000_000, "colonies"),
    ("Nuclear fusion plants", 20_000_000_000, "plants"),
    ("Years of free healthcare for Earth", 4_000_000_000_000, "years"),
    ("Years of free education for everyone", 1_000_000_000_000, "years")
]

for item, cost, unit in alternatives:
    quantity = total_waste / cost
    if quantity > 1000:
        print(f"• {quantity:,.0f} {item}")
    else:
        print(f"• {quantity:.0f} {item}")

print("\n🎯 OR MORE REALISTICALLY:")
print("• Cure every disease")
print("• End aging")
print("• Achieve biological immortality")
print("• Make death optional")
print("• Have $100 trillion left over")
```

## The Investment Ratio That Defines Insanity

```{python}
#| echo: false
print("🚽 THE $119 TRILLION DEATH TOILET:\n")
print(f"• We flush ${119_000_000_000_000/365:,.0f} billion down it daily")
print(f"• That's ${119_000_000_000_000/365/24:,.0f} billion per hour")
print(f"• That's ${119_000_000_000_000/365/24/60:,.0f} billion per minute")
print(f"\n💊 CURE RESEARCH GETS: 0.06% of that")
print(f"\n📊 RATIO: 1,750:1 (death spending vs cure spending)")
```

## The Bottom Line

1. **Military Spending**: $2.7T (what they admit)
2. **Real War Cost**: $9.7T (including destruction)
3. **Disease Burden**: $109T (the real apocalypse)
4. **Total Death Cost**: $119T (8% war, 92% disease)
5. **Cure Investment**: $68B (0.06% of problem)

**Translation**: We spend 1,750 times more dealing with death than preventing it.

## This Is Not Sustainable

We're on an exponential curve. Disease costs rise 3-5% annually. Military spending grows to match "threats". Meanwhile cure funding stays flat.

**10 years from now**:
- Disease burden: $150T
- War costs: $12T
- Cure funding: Still $68B

**20 years from now**:
- Disease burden: $200T+
- Society collapses under healthcare costs
- Too late to fix

## But Here's the Beautiful Part

**We only need 1% of the death toilet to fix everything.**

$119T × 1% = $1.19T for cures

That would be:
- 17X increase in cure funding
- Enough to cure most diseases in a decade
- Enough to reverse aging
- Enough to make death optional

Instead of a 1,750:1 ratio of death to cures...
We'd have a 99:1 ratio.

Still insane, but survivable.
