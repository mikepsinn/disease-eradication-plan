## The Best Investment in America (Spoiler: It's Bribes)

Want to know the greatest investment opportunity in history? It's not Bitcoin. It's not AI stocks. It's not even cocaine trafficking.

It's buying politicians.

For every $1 spent on lobbying, corporations get $1,813 back in government contracts. That's a 181,300% return. Warren Buffett would sell his grandmother for those numbers.

## How to Buy a Democracy: A Practical Guide

### Step 1: Hire an Ex-Congressman

There are 13,700 registered lobbyists in Washington. Half of them used to work in the government they're now bribing. It's like letting bank robbers become security consultants, except legal.

The revolving door spins so fast it powers half of DC.

### Step 2: Speak the Universal Language (Money)

In 2023, corporations spent $4.1 billion on lobbying. That's $7.7 million per congressman. For context, the median congressman makes $174,000 a year.

Do the math. Actually don't. It's depressing.

### Step 3: Write the Laws Yourself

Why wait for Congress to write laws when you can do it yourself?

Pharmaceutical companies literally write their own regulations. Defense contractors write military budgets. It's like letting prisoners design their own jails, except the prisoners have yachts.

Example: The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003. Written by pharma lobbyists. Banned the government from negotiating drug prices. Result: Americans pay $1,200 for insulin that costs $6 to make.

Democracy!

## The Military-Industrial Complex: Murder Inc.

Lockheed Martin's business model:

1. Donate to politicians ($4.7 million in 2022)
2. Get contracts ($75 billion in 2022)
3. Use profits to donate more
4. Repeat until Earth explodes

They've distributed operations across 42 states. Not for efficiency - for political leverage. Fire one employee in Wyoming and both senators scream about "jobs."

It's genius. Evil genius, but genius.

### The F-35: A Love Story

The F-35 fighter jet program will cost $1.7 trillion over its lifetime. It barely works. The helmet alone costs $400,000. For that money, you could buy an actual house and strap rockets to it.

But here's the beautiful part: Parts are manufactured in 45 states. Try to cancel it and 90 senators have heart attacks.

That's not a bug. It's a feature.

## Big Pharma: Your Dealer Has a Lobbyist

The pharmaceutical industry employs 3 lobbyists for every member of Congress. That's 1,600 people whose job is making sure grandma can't afford her heart medication.

### The Insulin Racket

Insulin was discovered in 1922. The inventors sold the patent for $1 because they wanted everyone to have it.

Today's price: $300 per vial in America. $8 in civilized countries.

The drug hasn't changed. The formula is identical. But the lobbying budget went from $0 to $4.88 billion.

The correlation is hard to ignore.

### The Patent System: Monetizing Misery

Here's how pharma ensures diseases stay profitable:

1. Company discovers cure for Disease X
2. Patents it for 20 years
3. Charges $100,000 per dose
4. Poor people die
5. Patent expires
6. Generic version could cost $10
7. But by then, Disease X has mutated
8. Start over with Disease X-2: Electric Boogaloo

We've created a system where keeping you sick is worth $1.5 trillion in annual profits, but curing you is a one-time payment.

Guess which one Wall Street prefers?

### The FDA: Pharma's Intern Program

The FDA gets 75% of its drug review budget from the companies it regulates. That's like letting criminals fund the police. Actually, it's exactly like that.

FDA officials who approve drugs get hired by pharma companies at 10x their government salary. FDA officials who reject drugs get "reassigned to special projects."

The message is clear: Play ball or find a new sport.

## The Money Machine

Here's how regulatory capture works:

1. **Campaign Contributions**: Perfectly legal bribes. Citizens United made corporations people, and people can donate unlimited money through Super PACs.

2. **Revolving Door**: Work in government, learn the system, sell that knowledge to the highest bidder. It's LinkedIn for corruption.

3. **Lobbying**: Hire people to whisper sweet nothings (and campaign donation promises) in politicians' ears.

4. **Jobs Blackmail**: Spread operations across districts. Threaten to leave if politicians don't cooperate. "Nice employment rate you got there. Shame if something happened to it."

5. **Regulatory Capture**: Get your people appointed to agencies that regulate you. The fox doesn't guard the henhouse - the fox owns the henhouse and charges the chickens rent.

## The Defense Budget: A Comedy in Three Acts

**Act 1**: Pentagon says they need $800 billion for "readiness"

**Act 2**: Congress adds $25 billion the Pentagon didn't ask for

**Act 3**: Money goes to contractors in key congressional districts

*Curtain falls. Audience (taxpayers) weeps.*

The Pentagon has never passed an audit. They literally don't know where trillions of dollars went. But somehow they know they need more.

## Your Congressman: A Price List

Want to buy a vote? Here's the going rate:

- House member: $10,000 - $50,000 in campaign contributions
- Senator: $50,000 - $500,000
- Committee chair: $1 million+
- Presidential influence: $20 million+ (bulk discount available)

For less than the price of a Super Bowl ad, you can own a piece of American democracy.

## Why Nothing Ever Changes: A Mathematical Proof

- Number of Americans who want lower drug prices: 330 million
- Money they contribute to this cause: $0
- Number of pharma executives who want high drug prices: 1,000
- Money they contribute: $4.88 billion

1,000 > 330,000,000 (when you multiply by money)

That's not corruption. That's math.

## The Solution They Don't Want

Here's the secret: Their whole system depends on diffuse costs and concentrated benefits.

Each American loses $100 to corruption. Not worth fighting over.
Each corporation gains $100 million. Very worth fighting for.

But what if we concentrated the benefits of reform? What if curing disease was more profitable than treating it? What if peace paid better than war?

That's what the 1% Treaty does. It doesn't fight the system. It hijacks it.

You're going to out-bribe the bribers.

## The Incentive Structure From Hell

Everyone in the system is perfectly incentivized to NOT cure diseases:

### Pharmaceutical Companies
- **Cure a disease:** One-time payment, stock price drops
- **Treat symptoms forever:** Infinite money printer go brrrrr
- **Winner:** Treating symptoms

### Researchers
- **Find controversial breakthrough:** Get attacked by peers, lose funding
- **Publish incremental nothing:** Get promoted, tenure, speaking fees
- **Winner:** Incremental nothing

### FDA Regulators
- **Approve drug that kills someone:** Congressional hearing, fired, career over
- **Delay drug that could save millions:** Nobody notices, get promoted
- **Winner:** Delay everything

### Insurance Companies
- **Pay for cures:** Lose money
- **Deny coverage:** Make money
- **Winner:** "Prior authorization required" (translation: go die)

### Politicians
- **Fund actual research:** Boring, no photo ops
- **Create new agencies with acronyms:** Ribbon cutting ceremonies!
- **Winner:** The National Institute for Instituting Institutes (NIII)

Everyone who matters wins. Everyone who's dying loses.

## The Beautiful Irony

The same lobbying system that created this mess will fix it:

1. Create massive financial incentives for peace and health
2. Fund lobbying for the 1% Treaty (completely legal)
3. Make it more profitable to cure than to kill
4. Watch the same corporations pivot overnight

Lockheed Martin doesn't love war. They love money.
Pfizer doesn't love disease. They love money.

So we'll make health and peace the most profitable investments in history.

## Your Democracy: An Auction House

Every law is for sale. Every regulation negotiable. Every politician has a price.

That's not cynicism. That's Wednesday in Washington.

The military-industrial complex figured this out in 1961. Big Pharma perfected it in the 1990s. Wall Street turned it into an art form in 2008.

Now it's your turn.

You're not going to fix democracy. That's impossible. You're going to buy it back.

One perfectly legal bribe at a time.

*P.S. - If this chapter depressed you, remember: The same system that lets corporations buy politicians also lets you buy them back. The corruption is the feature you're going to exploit. It's like using the Death Star's exhaust port, but with spreadsheets instead of proton torpedoes.*
