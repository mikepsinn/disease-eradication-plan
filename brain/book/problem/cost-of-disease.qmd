While you read this sentence, disease just deleted $12.6 million of human potential from existence.

By the time you finish this paragraph, $60 million more will evaporate into cancer treatments, heart surgeries, and funeral expenses. Also Dave from accounting's weird rash, but that's probably unrelated.

Humanity hemorrhages [**$397.4 trillion annually**](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t) to diseases that are basically just engineering problems with meat robots.

That's more than the entire global economy. Every year. It's like Earth's economy caught fire, then we decided to sell tickets to watch it burn while complaining we can't afford fire extinguishers.

"Wait," you say, demonstrating basic arithmetic skills, "global GDP is only [$101 trillion](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#global-gdp). How can we lose more than everything that exists?"

Because economists forgot to include the dying part in their calculations. This is like calculating the cost of a plane crash without including the plane.

## The Actual Bill (Economist-Approved Misery Accounting)

Here's what disease actually costs, translated from economist-speak into human language:

| What We're Losing | What This Actually Means | Annual Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Medical Costs** | Paying doctors to Google your symptoms in a room that costs $500/hour | [$8.2 Trillion](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#global-health-spending-gdp) |
| **Lost Productivity** | Sick people make fewer spreadsheets, decreasing global PowerPoint supply | [$6.7 Trillion](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#wef-harvard-ncd-cost) |
| **Lost Human Life (DALYs)** | Dead people contribute zero to the economy (economists finally noticed) | [$382.5 Trillion](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#ihme-gbd-2019) |
| **TOTAL DISASTER** | **More money than exists on Earth** | [**$397.4 Trillion**](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t) |

Let me explain that last one, because it's where the real horror lives.

## How to Measure Suffering Without Feeling Feelings (The DALY)

DALY stands for "Disability-Adjusted Life Year," which is economist-speak for "quantifying human misery without having to look people in the eye."

One DALY = One year of healthy human life, deleted.

Here's how it works:

- Die at 40 instead of 80? That's 40 DALYs (40 years just disappeared, like they were never scheduled)
- Spend 10 years severely depressed? 5 DALYs (economists calculated that being miserable counts as being half-dead, which is oddly accurate)
- Entire human species combined? **[2.55 BILLION DALYs annually](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#ihme-gbd-2019)**

That's 2.55 billion years of human potential dissolving into medical bills, funeral expenses, and awkward silences at Thanksgiving because Uncle Jim isn't there anymore.

### What the WHO Thinks You're Worth (Spoiler: Not Much)

The World Health Organization decided [one year of human life is worth 1-3 times GDP per capita](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#who-choice-daly-value). They made this calculation sober, which is surprising.

Let's use 3x GDP per capita because we're optimists who think humans are worth at least three years of their economic output. This is still depressing, but it's the most generous estimate bureaucrats could manage.

The math is simple and horrifying:

- Value per healthy year: $150,000 (less than a Tesla, apparently)
- Total DALYs lost annually: 2.55 billion years

Multiply these together:

$$ 2,550,000,000 \text{ years} \times \$150,000/\text{year} = \$382.5 \text{ trillion} $$

That's $382.5 trillion of human potential we flush annually down the toilet labeled "diseases we haven't cured yet because the money went to bombs."

## Let's Break Down This Apocalypse By Time Unit

$397.4 trillion annually breaks down to:

- **$1.09 trillion EVERY DAY** (more than most countries make in a year)
- **$45 billion EVERY HOUR** (enough to fund a mid-size cancer research institute)
- **$757 million EVERY MINUTE** (more than most lottery jackpots)
- **$12.6 million EVERY SECOND** (a new Tesla Roadster worth of human potential, gone, every second, forever)

By the time you finish this chapter (about 10 minutes), disease will have cost humanity more than the entire Apollo moon program. We went to the moon for less than one chapter's worth of disease costs.

The math is not mathing, humanity.

## What's Actually Deleting Everyone (The Greatest Hits)

Here's what's killing people while you read about what's killing people:

| Disease | Annual Deaths | Daily Deaths | Will Die Reading This Chapter |
|---------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Heart Disease | [20 million](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#death-causes-vs-fear) | 54,800 | 500 |
| Cancer | [10.4 million](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#cancer-deaths-10m-annually) | 28,500 | 260 |
| Respiratory Disease | [6.5 million](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#respiratory-disease-deaths-6-9m-annually) | 17,800 | 160 |
| Dementia | [2.6 million](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#alzheimers-deaths-2-6m-annually) | 7,100 | 65 |
| Diabetes | [3.4 million](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#diabetes-deaths-2m-annually) | 9,300 | 85 |
| Kidney Disease | [1.4 million](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#kidney-disease-deaths-1-4m-annually) | 3,800 | 35 |
| Tuberculosis | [1.3 million](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#tuberculosis-deaths-1-3m-annually) | 3,600 | 33 |
| **TOTAL** | **[55 million](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)** | **150,000** | **1,370** |

1,370 humans will permanently stop existing while you read this chapter. That's like crashing five 747s worth of people, except it happens every 10 minutes, forever, and nobody makes a documentary about it (if this happened to actual planes, you'd ground all flights within an hour, but with humans dying from disease you just shrug and call it "natural causes").

While you're busy testing 0.000003% of potential cures:

- **[10 million people annually](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#amr-10m-2050)** will die from antimicrobial resistance by 2050 (bacteria evolved faster than we did, which is embarrassing)
- **[600,000 people annually](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#malaria-deaths-600k-annually)** die from malaria (mosquitoes: 600,000, humanity: 0)
- **[10.4 million people annually](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#cancer-deaths-10m-annually)** die from cancer (your own cells killing you because they forgot how to die)
- **[20 million people annually](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#death-causes-vs-fear)** die from cardiovascular disease (hearts that gave up on humanity, can't blame them)

Each death represents:

- Someone's entire universe ending
- A grandmother who won't meet grandchildren
- A scientist who might have cured something
- $4 million in lost economic value (if we're being dead-eyed economists about it)
- Literally infinite sadness if you're the one dying or know the person

## Your Body Is Not Magic, It's Just Broken

Your body is not mystical.
It's not "natural" in a good way.
It's definitely not "in balance with the universe."

It's a machine. A magnificent, self-repairing, self-replicating biological machine made of 37 trillion cells that evolved over 4 billion years to not die immediately.

And like all machines, it breaks. A lot. Constantly, actually.

But here's the good news: **Machines can be fixed.**

Every disease is just a broken part with a stupid name:

- **Cancer?** Cells with broken stop buttons (they forgot how to die on schedule)
- **Diabetes?** Broken sugar processing (your pancreas is like a calculator that can't do math anymore)
- **Alzheimer's?** Broken garbage disposal in brain cells (trash accumulates until thinking stops)
- **Depression?** Broken neurotransmitter regulation (your brain's chemical factory set the levels wrong)
- **Aging?** Everything breaking at once, very slowly, until you stop (rude)

You don't fix these broken parts because:

1. You don't fully understand the manual (DNA is 3 billion letters long and in a language you're still learning)
2. You haven't tested 99.999997% of the repair tools (166 billion possible molecules and you've tried ~0.003% of them, which is like trying to find your car keys by checking one pocket then giving up forever)
3. You're too busy spending money on things that create corpses instead of preventing them (see: military budgets, which are essentially "death R&D")

## What This Actually Costs

The $397.4 trillion "Disease Tax" is optional. Not optional like "you can skip it," but optional like "it's not a law of physics, just a choice humanity keeps making."

It's the price you pay for being too stupid to fix your own broken meat robots.

Every day you delay costs another **$1.09 trillion**. Not theoretical future money. Real human potential dissolving right now into medical bills, funeral expenses, and GoFundMe campaigns while politicians argue whether you can "afford" to test molecules.

### Your Priorities, Written in Your Budgets

- **Military budget:** Gets [$7.4 billion daily](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending) to practice ending human life
- **Medical research:** Gets [$185 million daily](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#global-gov-med-research-spending) to practice extending it

That's a **40:1 ratio in favor of death over life.**

If aliens intercepted your budget spreadsheets, they'd conclude you're a death cult that occasionally dabbles in medicine as a hobby (we have intercepted them - this is accurate).

### The Future You're Paying For

Somewhere in the future, there's a Tuesday when:

- Cancer is a minor inconvenience like a cold
- Hearts are as repairable as carburetors
- Death is optional, not mandatory
- Aging is something that happened to your ancestors

Every day between now and that Tuesday costs you $1.09 trillion. That's the real invoice. The actual bill for choosing bombs over grandma's cancer treatment.

The future is waiting. You're just too busy building better ways to explode each other to notice (although the explosions are very impressive, to be fair).
