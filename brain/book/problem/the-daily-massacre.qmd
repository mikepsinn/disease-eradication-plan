## Right Now, As You Read This

{{< include ../../figures/death-counter-realtime.qmd >}}

## The Numbers That Should Start a Revolution

Every single day:
- **[150,000 people die](../references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)**
- **130,000 from disease** (calculated from annual disease deaths)
- **80,000 were preventable** (53% of deaths are preventable)
- **15,000 are children** (based on 5 million annual child deaths)

That's fifty 9/11s. Every. Single. Day.

Your parent, child, or friend is statistically likely to be one of them.

But unlike 9/11, we don't invade anyone about it. We don't even have a color-coded alert system.

That's:
- **6,250 deaths per hour**
- **104 deaths per minute**
- **1.7 deaths per second**

Biotechnology could prevent most of these deaths.

But humanity wastes \$2.7 trillion on bombs, bullets, and nonsense like that instead.

By the time you finish reading this chapter, approximately **500 people** will have died from diseases we could have cured if we spent money on research instead of weapons.

## Let's Make This Personal

**If you're 40 years old:**
- You have approximately **15,000 days** left to live
- In your remaining lifetime, **2.3 BILLION** people will die
- **1.2 billion** of those deaths are preventable
- That's **80,000** preventable deaths for each day you have left

**If you're 60 years old:**
- You have approximately **8,000 days** left to live
- In your remaining lifetime, **1.2 BILLION** people will die
- **640 million** of those deaths are preventable
- That's **80,000** preventable deaths for each day you have left

## The Diseases Killing Everyone

| Disease | Annual Deaths | Daily Deaths | Deaths While You Read This |
|---------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Heart Disease | 17.9 million | 49,000 | 82 |
| Cancer | 10 million | 27,400 | 46 |
| Respiratory Disease | 6.9 million | 18,900 | 31 |
| Dementia | 2.6 million | 7,100 | 12 |
| Diabetes | 2.0 million | 5,500 | 9 |
| Kidney Disease | 1.4 million | 3,800 | 6 |
| Tuberculosis | 1.3 million | 3,600 | 6 |
| **TOTAL** | **[55 million](../references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)** | **150,000** | **250** |

## Meanwhile, Our Spending Priorities

{{< include ../../figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-bar-chart.qmd >}}

## Your Personal Death Clock

**Your risk of dying (by age):**
- **Age 30**: 0.1% annual chance (1 in 1,000)
- **Age 40**: 0.2% annual chance (1 in 500)
- **Age 50**: 0.4% annual chance (1 in 250)
- **Age 60**: 1% annual chance (1 in 100)
- **Age 70**: 2.5% annual chance (1 in 40)
- **Age 80**: 6% annual chance (1 in 17)
- **Age 90**: 15% annual chance (1 in 7)

**What kills you changes with age:**
- **Under 40**: Accidents, suicide, cancer
- **40-60**: Heart disease emerges, cancer increases
- **60-80**: Heart disease dominates, stroke rises
- **Over 80**: Everything at once

## The Geography of Death

### DAILY DEATH TOLL BY REGION:

| Region | Deaths/Day | Preventable |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| South Asia | 45,000 | 29,000 |
| East Asia | 38,000 | 17,000 |
| Sub-Saharan Africa | 35,000 | 26,000 |
| Europe | 16,000 | 5,000 |
| North America | 8,000 | 2,000 |
| Latin America | 8,000 | 4,000 |

**While you read this sentence:**
- **17 people** died in India
- **14 people** died in China
- **5 people** died in Africa
- **3 people** died in the United States
- **2 people** died in Europe

## What Could We Buy With Military Money?

With just **ONE YEAR** of military spending (\$2.7 trillion), we could:

### Option A: Save Everyone
- Fund 54,000 Oxford RECOVERY-style trials (\$50M each).
- Test 166 billion existing drug combinations.
- Cure 20-50 major diseases.
- Save 10-20 million lives annually.
- Give everyone 10+ extra years of life.
- Every submarine we don't build = 1,000 cancer labs we do build.

### Option B: Keep Building Weapons
- 500 more nuclear submarines.
- 10,000 more nuclear warheads.
- Autonomous killer robots.
- Space weapons.
- Hypersonic missiles.
- The ability to kill everyone 1,000 times instead of 535 times.
- The nuclear extinction lottery: 13,000 warheads, 0 winners.

## The Companies Profiting From Death

### The Merchants of Death (Military Contractors)
- **Lockheed Martin**: \$67 billion/year selling death.
- **Raytheon**: \$42 billion/year selling death.
- **Boeing Defense**: \$26 billion/year selling death.
- **Northrop Grumman**: \$36 billion/year selling death.
- **General Dynamics**: \$39 billion/year selling death.

### The Could-Be Heroes (If We Funded Them)
- **All rare disease research combined**: \$6 billion/year.
- **All Alzheimer's research**: \$3.5 billion/year.
- **All cancer research**: \$20 billion/year.
- **All mental health research**: \$1.5 billion/year.

## The Most Insane Fact

### REALITY CHECK:

- Nuclear weapons: **[13,000](../references.qmd#world-warheads)**
- Times we can destroy Earth: **[67](../references.qmd#nuclear-extinction)**
- Diseases we can cure: **Almost none** (treatments for <5% of rare diseases)
- Annual military spending: **[$2,700,000,000,000](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)**
- Annual cure spending: **[$68,000,000,000](../references.qmd#global-gov-med-research-spending)**
- Ratio: **40:1** in favor of KILLING

### WHAT THIS MEANS:
- For every $1 trying to save your life, we spend **$40** trying to end it
- We have **1.6** nuclear weapons per million humans
- We have **0 cures** for 95% of diseases
- Your government values killing enemies **40X** more than saving you

## Today's Death Toll

### THE RELENTLESS MARCH:

- **Deaths from disease today**: 130,000
- **Children dead today**: 14,300
- **Preventable deaths today**: 78,000

### THE UNSTOPPABLE PATTERN:
- By midnight tonight: **130,000 will be dead**
- Tomorrow: **Another 130,000**
- The day after: **Another 130,000**
- Forever. **Until we stop this.**

## The Speed of Death vs The Speed of Cures

| Metric | Death | Medical Progress |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| Speed | 3 people per second | 1 drug approved per month |
| Scale | 55 million per year | 50 drugs per year |
| Acceleration | Getting worse | Getting slower |
| Investment | \$109 trillion burden | \$68 billion research |
| Trend | Exponential increase | Linear at best |

## A Simple Question

If an alien visited Earth and saw:
- We spend \$2.7 trillion on weapons.
- We spend \$68 billion on medical research.
- 150,000 people die daily from disease.
- We have 13,000 nuclear weapons but no cure for cancer.

What would they conclude about humanity?

**Answer**: That we're a death cult that chose extinction.

## But Here's the Thing

**We could fix this with 1% of military spending.**

Just 1%.

That's \$27 billion redirected from killing to curing.

That would:
- Fund 540 Oxford-style trials annually.
- Test 10,000+ treatments.
- Cure 20-50 diseases in a decade.
- Save millions of lives.
- Cost the military almost nothing (they keep 99%).

## The Choice Is Binary

### Path A: Status Quo
- 150,000 die today.
- 150,000 die tomorrow.
- 55 million die this year.
- Your mom dies of Alzheimer's.
- Your kid dies of cancer.
- You die of heart disease.
- Everyone dies of preventable causes.
- Species extinct by 2150.

### Path B: The 1% Treaty
- Redirect 1% of military spending.
- Cure major diseases in 10 years.
- Save millions annually.
- Add 20+ years to life expectancy.
- Your mom sees her great-grandkids.
- Your kids see 150.
- You might see 200.
- Species achieves biological immortality.

## The Clock Is Still Ticking

### FINAL TALLY FOR THIS CHAPTER:

**While you read this chapter:**
- **500** people died
- **300** were preventable
- **50** were children
- **$150 million** was spent on weapons
- **$3 million** was spent on cures

**By tomorrow at this time:**
- **150,000** more will be dead
- You'll be **one day closer** to joining them

**Unless we fix this.**
