## Right Now, As You Read This

{{< include ../../figures/death-counter-realtime.qmd >}}

## The Numbers That Should Start a Revolution

Every single day:

- **[150,000 people die](../references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)**
- **130,000 from disease** (calculated from annual disease deaths)
- **[80,000 were preventable](../references.qmd#53-percent-preventable-deaths)** (53% of deaths are preventable)
- **[13,700 are children](../references.qmd#5-million-annual-child-deaths)** (based on 5 million annual child deaths)

That's fifty 9/11s.
Every. Single. Day.

Your parent, child, or friend is statistically likely to be one of them.

But unlike 9/11, we don't invade anyone about it.
We don't even have a color-coded alert system.

Every hour: **6,250 deaths**. Every minute: **104 deaths**. Every second: **1.7 deaths**.

Biotechnology could prevent most of these. Instead, humanity points its resources at creating corpses, not preventing them.

By the time you finish this chapter, approximately **500 people** will have died from diseases we could have cured.

## Making Death Personal

**You're 40?** You've got roughly **15,000 days** left. During your remaining lifetime, **2.3 billion** people will die. **1.2 billion** of those deaths? Preventable. That's **80,000** preventable deaths for each day you have left.

**You're 60?** About **8,000 days** remain. **1.2 billion** people will die before you do. **640 million** preventably.

## Your Personal Death Lottery

**[Annual death risk by age](../references.qmd#us-mortality-rate-by-age):**

- **Age 30**: 1 in 1,000
- **Age 40**: 1 in 500
- **Age 50**: 1 in 250
- **Age 60**: 1 in 100
- **Age 70**: 1 in 40
- **Age 80**: 1 in 17
- **Age 90**: 1 in 7

**[What kills you depends on when](../references.qmd#leading-causes-of-death-by-age-group):**

- **Under 40**: Accidents, suicide, cancer
- **40-60**: Heart disease joins the party
- **60-80**: Heart disease dominates, stroke crashes in
- **Over 80**: Everything at once

## The Daily Massacre

By midnight tonight: **130,000 dead from disease**. Tomorrow: **Another 130,000**. The day after: **Another 130,000**. Forever. Until you stop this.

Here's how: If an alien saw **150,000 humans die daily** from predictable, preventable causes while we did nothing, they'd conclude we're a death cult that chose extinction.

They'd be right.

## The Clock Keeps Ticking

While you read this chapter: **500 people died**. **265 were preventable**. **46 were children**.

By this time tomorrow: **150,000 more dead**. You'll be one day closer to joining them.

Here's how you fix this: [Turn the page].
