## Right Now, As You Read This

{{< include ../../figures/death-counter-realtime.qmd >}}

## The Numbers That Should Start a Revolution

Every single day:

- **[150,000 people die](../references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)**
- **130,000 from disease** (calculated from annual disease deaths)
- **[80,000 were preventable](../references.qmd#53-percent-preventable-deaths)** (53% of deaths are preventable)
- **[14,300 are children](../references.qmd#5-million-annual-child-deaths)** (based on 5 million annual child deaths)

That's fifty 9/11s.
Every. Single. Day.

Your parent, child, or friend is statistically likely to be one of them.

But unlike 9/11, we don't invade anyone about it.
We don't even have a color-coded alert system.

That's:

- **6,250 deaths per hour**
- **104 deaths per minute**
- **1.7 deaths per second**

Biotechnology could prevent most of these deaths.

But humanity's resources are overwhelmingly pointed at creating corpses, not preventing them.

By the time you finish reading this chapter, approximately **500 people** will have died from diseases we could have cured.

## Let's Make This Personal

**If you're 40 years old:**

- You have approximately **15,000 days** left to live
- In your remaining lifetime, **2.3 BILLION** people will die
- **1.2 billion** of those deaths are preventable
- That's **80,000** preventable deaths for each day you have left

**If you're 60 years old:**

- You have approximately **8,000 days** left to live
- In your remaining lifetime, **1.2 BILLION** people will die
- **640 million** of those deaths are preventable
- That's **80,000** preventable deaths for each day you have left

Want to know how insane our spending priorities are? See [The $120.5 Trillion Death Toilet](the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd) for the shocking 40:1 ratio.

## Your Personal Death Clock

**[Your risk of dying (by age)](../references.qmd#us-mortality-rate-by-age):**

- **Age 30**: 0.1% annual chance (1 in 1,000)
- **Age 40**: 0.2% annual chance (1 in 500)
- **Age 50**: 0.4% annual chance (1 in 250)
- **Age 60**: 1% annual chance (1 in 100)
- **Age 70**: 2.5% annual chance (1 in 40)
- **Age 80**: 6% annual chance (1 in 17)
- **Age 90**: 15% annual chance (1 in 7)

**[What kills you changes with age](../references.qmd#leading-causes-of-death-by-age-group):**

- **Under 40**: Accidents, suicide, cancer
- **40-60**: Heart disease emerges, cancer increases
- **60-80**: Heart disease dominates, stroke rises
- **Over 80**: Everything at once


## Today's Death Toll

### THE RELENTLESS MARCH

- **Deaths from disease today**: 130,000
- **Children dead today**: 14,300
- **Preventable deaths today**: 80,000

### THE UNSTOPPABLE PATTERN

- By midnight tonight: **130,000 will be dead**
- Tomorrow: **Another 130,000**
- The day after: **Another 130,000**
- Forever.
  **Until we stop this.**

## A Simple Question

If an alien visited Earth and saw that **150,000 of us die every day** from predictable, preventable causes, and we just... let it happen... what would they conclude?

**Answer**: That we're a death cult that chose extinction.

## The Clock Is Still Ticking

### FINAL TALLY FOR THIS CHAPTER

**While you read this chapter:**

- **500** people died
- **265** were preventable (53% of total)
- **50** were children

**By tomorrow at this time:**

- **150,000** more will be dead
- You'll be **one day closer** to joining them

**Unless we fix this.**
