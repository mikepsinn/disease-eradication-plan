## Right Now, As You Read This

{{< include ../../figures/death-counter-realtime.qmd >}}

## The Numbers Are Incomprehensible

Every single day:
- **150,000 people die**
- **130,000 from disease**
- **80,000 were preventable**
- **15,000 are children**

That's:
- **6,250 deaths per hour**
- **104 deaths per minute**
- **1.7 deaths per second**

By the time you finish reading this chapter, approximately **500 people** will have died from diseases we could have cured if we spent money on research instead of weapons.

## Let's Make This Personal

```{python}
#| echo: false
import random

# Generate personalized death statistics
your_age = random.randint(25, 65)
years_left = 82 - your_age  # Average life expectancy
days_left = years_left * 365

deaths_in_your_lifetime = years_left * 365 * 150000
preventable_deaths = deaths_in_your_lifetime * 0.53

print(f"If you're around {your_age} years old:")
print(f"• You have approximately {days_left:,} days left to live")
print(f"• In your remaining lifetime, {deaths_in_your_lifetime/1e9:.1f} BILLION people will die")
print(f"• {preventable_deaths/1e9:.1f} billion of those deaths are preventable")
print(f"• That's {int(preventable_deaths/days_left):,} preventable deaths for each day you have left")
```

## The Diseases Killing Everyone

| Disease | Annual Deaths | Daily Deaths | Deaths While You Read This |
|---------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| Heart Disease | 17.9 million | 49,000 | 82 |
| Cancer | 10 million | 27,400 | 46 |
| Respiratory Disease | 6.9 million | 18,900 | 31 |
| Dementia | 2.6 million | 7,100 | 12 |
| Diabetes | 2.0 million | 5,500 | 9 |
| Kidney Disease | 1.4 million | 3,800 | 6 |
| Tuberculosis | 1.3 million | 3,600 | 6 |
| **TOTAL** | **55 million** | **150,000** | **250** |

## Meanwhile, Our Spending Priorities

{{< include ../../figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-bar-chart.qmd >}}

## Your Personal Death Clock

Here's when the diseases will get you (statistically):

```{python}
#| echo: false
import pandas as pd

# Personal risk calculator
def calculate_death_risk(age_group):
    risks = {
        'Heart Disease': {'20-40': 5, '40-60': 25, '60-80': 45, '80+': 60},
        'Cancer': {'20-40': 8, '40-60': 30, '60-80': 35, '80+': 25},
        'Alzheimer\'s': {'20-40': 0, '40-60': 2, '60-80': 15, '80+': 35},
        'Diabetes': {'20-40': 3, '40-60': 8, '60-80': 12, '80+': 10},
        'Accident': {'20-40': 15, '40-60': 5, '60-80': 3, '80+': 2},
        'Other': {'20-40': 69, '40-60': 30, '60-80': 15, '80+': 8}
    }

    return risks

# Create visualization
age_groups = ['20-40', '40-60', '60-80', '80+']
risks = calculate_death_risk(age_groups[0])

print("YOUR LIKELIHOOD OF DYING FROM EACH CAUSE (%):\n")
for age in age_groups:
    print(f"\n📊 Age {age}:")
    age_risks = {disease: risks[disease][age] for disease in risks}
    sorted_risks = sorted(age_risks.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    for disease, risk in sorted_risks[:4]:
        if risk > 0:
            bar = '█' * (risk // 2)
            print(f"   {disease}: {bar} {risk}%")
```

## The Geography of Death

```{python}
#| echo: false
# Death rates by region
death_data = {
    'Region': ['Sub-Saharan Africa', 'South Asia', 'East Asia', 'Europe', 'North America', 'Latin America'],
    'Daily Deaths': [35000, 45000, 38000, 16000, 8000, 8000],
    'Preventable %': [75, 65, 45, 30, 25, 50]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(death_data)

print("DAILY DEATH TOLL BY REGION:\n")
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    total = row['Daily Deaths']
    preventable = int(total * row['Preventable %'] / 100)
    bar = '💀' * (total // 5000)
    print(f"{row['Region']:20} {bar} {total:,} deaths/day")
    print(f"{'':20} {'':5} ↳ {preventable:,} preventable\n")
```

## What Could We Buy With Military Money?

With just **ONE YEAR** of military spending ($2.7 trillion), we could:

### Option A: Save Everyone
- Fund 1,000 Oxford RECOVERY-style trials
- Test every existing drug for every disease
- Cure 20-50 major diseases
- Save 10-20 million lives annually
- Give everyone 10+ extra years of life

### Option B: Keep Building Weapons
- 500 more nuclear submarines
- 10,000 more nuclear warheads
- Autonomous killer robots
- Space weapons
- Hypersonic missiles
- The ability to kill everyone 1,000 times instead of 535 times

## The Companies Profiting From Death

### The Merchants of Death (Military Contractors)
- **Lockheed Martin**: $67 billion/year selling death
- **Raytheon**: $42 billion/year selling death
- **Boeing Defense**: $26 billion/year selling death
- **Northrop Grumman**: $36 billion/year selling death
- **General Dynamics**: $39 billion/year selling death

### The Could-Be Heroes (If We Funded Them)
- **All rare disease research combined**: $6 billion/year
- **All Alzheimer's research**: $3.5 billion/year
- **All cancer research**: $20 billion/year
- **All mental health research**: $1.5 billion/year

## The Most Insane Fact

```{python}
#| echo: false
# Calculate the insanity
weapons_per_human = 13000 / 8000  # Nuclear weapons per billion people
cures_last_50_years = 0  # Diseases eradicated by NIH in 50 years

print("🔴 REALITY CHECK:\n")
print(f"Nuclear weapons: 13,000")
print(f"Times we can destroy Earth: 67")
print(f"Diseases we can cure: Almost none")
print(f"Annual military spending: $2,700,000,000,000")
print(f"Annual cure spending: $68,000,000,000")
print(f"Ratio: 40:1 in favor of KILLING\n")

print("📊 WHAT THIS MEANS:")
print(f"• For every $1 trying to save your life, we spend $40 trying to end it")
print(f"• We have 1.6 nuclear weapons per million humans")
print(f"• We have 0 cures for 95% of diseases")
print(f"• Your government values killing enemies 40X more than saving you")
```

## Today's Death Toll (Real-Time)

As of right now, today's deaths from disease:

```{python}
#| echo: false
from datetime import datetime

# Calculate today's deaths so far
now = datetime.now()
seconds_today = now.hour * 3600 + now.minute * 60 + now.second
deaths_today = int(seconds_today * DISEASE_DEATHS_PER_SECOND)

print(f"⏰ Time: {now.strftime('%I:%M %p')}")
print(f"💀 Deaths from disease today: {deaths_today:,}")
print(f"🚸 Children dead today: {int(deaths_today * 0.11):,}")
print(f"♿ Preventable deaths today: {int(deaths_today * 0.6):,}")
print(f"\n📈 By midnight tonight: ~130,000 will be dead")
print(f"🔄 Tomorrow: Another 130,000")
print(f"🔄 The day after: Another 130,000")
print(f"🔄 Forever. Until we stop this.")
```

## The Speed of Death vs The Speed of Cures

| Metric | Death | Medical Progress |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| Speed | 3 people per second | 1 drug approved per month |
| Scale | 55 million per year | 50 drugs per year |
| Acceleration | Getting worse | Getting slower |
| Investment | $109 trillion burden | $68 billion research |
| Trend | Exponential increase | Linear at best |

## A Simple Question

If an alien visited Earth and saw:
- We spend $2.7 trillion on weapons
- We spend $68 billion on medical research
- 150,000 people die daily from disease
- We have 13,000 nuclear weapons but no cure for cancer

What would they conclude about humanity?

**Answer**: That we're a death cult that chose extinction.

## But Here's the Thing

**We could fix this with 1% of military spending.**

Just 1%.

That's $27 billion redirected from killing to curing.

That would:
- Fund 540 Oxford-style trials annually
- Test 10,000+ treatments
- Cure 20-50 diseases in a decade
- Save millions of lives
- Cost the military almost nothing (they keep 99%)

## The Choice Is Binary

### Path A: Status Quo
- 150,000 die today
- 150,000 die tomorrow
- 55 million die this year
- Your mom dies of Alzheimer's
- Your kid dies of cancer
- You die of heart disease
- Everyone dies of preventable causes
- Species extinct by 2150

### Path B: The 1% Treaty
- Redirect 1% of military spending
- Cure major diseases in 10 years
- Save millions annually
- Add 20+ years to life expectancy
- Your mom sees her great-grandkids
- Your kids see 150
- You might see 200
- Species achieves biological immortality

## The Clock Is Still Ticking

```{python}
#| echo: false
# Final death count
print("⚰️ FINAL TALLY FOR THIS CHAPTER:\n")
print("While you read this chapter:")
print("• 500 people died")
print("• 300 were preventable")
print("• 50 were children")
print("• $150 million was spent on weapons")
print("• $3 million was spent on cures")
print("\nBy tomorrow at this time:")
print("• 150,000 more will be dead")
print("• You'll be one day closer to joining them")
print("\nUnless we fix this.")
```
