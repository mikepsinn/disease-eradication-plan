## On The Numbers That Happen Every Day

### What's Happening Right Now

Every single day, like clockwork:

- **[150,000 people stop existing](../references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)**
- **130,000 from disease** (diseases are very effective at their job)
- **[80,000 were preventable](../references.qmd#53-percent-preventable-deaths)** (we had the technology, we just chose not to use it)
- **[13,700 are children](../references.qmd#5-million-annual-child-deaths)** (which matters if you believe children should continue existing)

That's fifty 9/11s. Every. Single. Day.

After the first 9/11, America invaded two countries and spent $2 trillion. After the fifty daily 9/11s, humanity shrugs and checks Instagram.

When one thing kills 3,000 people, it's a tragedy and we declare war. When diseases kill 50 times that every day, it's called "natural causes," which is Latin for "we couldn't be bothered to prevent it."

If aliens were studying us, they'd conclude we can count to 3,000 but not 150,000. This would explain a lot about our civilization.

#### The Math Of Death

Every hour: **6,250 deaths**. Every minute: **104 deaths**. Every second: **1.7 deaths**.

The technology to prevent most of this exists. It's currently busy building missiles instead. By the time you finish this chapter, approximately **500 people** will have died from diseases we could have cured if we weren't so invested in building better ways to explode.

## On Making This About You Personally

### Your Remaining Time (If You're 40)

You've got roughly **15,000 days** left, give or take a car accident. During your remaining lifetime, **2.3 billion** people will die. **1.2 billion** of those deaths? Preventable. That's **80,000** preventable deaths for each day you have left.

Which is a lot of preventable deaths. Enough to make you wonder what "preventable" means if we're not preventing them.

#### Your Remaining Time (If You're 60)

About **8,000 days** remain, assuming you don't eat nothing but bacon. **1.2 billion** people will die before you do. **640 million** of them preventably.

The word "preventably" is doing a lot of work in that sentence. It means we know how to prevent it. We just choose not to. Like knowing how to use a fire extinguisher but deciding to watch the house burn down instead because the extinguisher is expensive.

Want specifics on what's killing us? See [The Cost of Disease](cost-of-disease.qmd#whats-actually-killing-everyone). Spoiler: it's everything, constantly.

## On The Lottery You're Already Playing

**Your Annual Odds Of Dying ([By Age](../references.qmd#us-mortality-rate-by-age)):**

- **Age 30**: 1 in 1,000 (practically immortal, relatively speaking)
- **Age 40**: 1 in 500 (getting worse)
- **Age 50**: 1 in 250 (noticeably worse)
- **Age 60**: 1 in 100 (concerning)
- **Age 70**: 1 in 40 (very concerning)
- **Age 80**: 1 in 17 (extremely concerning)
- **Age 90**: 1 in 7 (statistically, you should panic)

These are better odds than the lottery, which is nice. They're worse odds than Russian roulette, which is less nice.

**[What Kills You When](../references.qmd#leading-causes-of-death-by-age-group):**

- **Under 40**: Accidents, suicide, cancer (youth is wasted on the young and also sometimes ends early)
- **40-60**: Heart disease joins the party (uninvited but inevitable)
- **60-80**: Heart disease dominates, stroke crashes in (your body is a machine that's breaking down)
- **Over 80**: Everything at once (your organs have a meeting and decide to quit simultaneously)

### What Happens While You Sleep Tonight

By midnight tonight, **130,000 more people will be dead from disease**. Tomorrow, another **130,000**. The day after, another **130,000**. This continues forever, or until you stop it, whichever comes first.

If aliens were studying humanity, they'd observe that **150,000 humans die daily** from predictable, preventable causes while we do nothing. They'd conclude we're either a death cult that chose extinction, or we're really bad at math.

They'd be right about both. By this time tomorrow, **150,000 more will be dead**, and you'll be one day closer to joining them, which statistically speaking is inevitable unless something changes.
