# The System is Broken: Why We Don't Have Cures

## The Greatest Machine Ever Built for Not Solving Problems

Imagine you're dying of thirst in the desert.
You stumble upon a facility with 50,000 brilliant engineers, a $50 billion budget, and every tool known to humanity.
They've been working on the water problem for 70 years.

You ask for water.

They hand you a 47-page grant application.

Welcome to medical research!

## The Perfect Storm of Institutional Failure

We haven't cured a single disease in [TODO: source - years since last disease cured] years.
Not because we can't.
Because we built a system specifically designed not to.

It's like we gathered the world's best mechanics, gave them infinite money, then made them fill out paperwork for 17 years before they could touch an engine.

Here's the beautiful dysfunction we've created:

### The NIH: Where Good Ideas Go to Die

The National Institutes of Health has a $47 billion budget [CITATION: nih-budget-fy2025].
With that money, they've perfected the art of:
- Making scientists spend [TODO: source - percentage] of their time writing grants
- Rejecting [CITATION: nih-grant-success-rate-19pct] of all applications
- Funding the same 20% of researchers who already have funding
- Creating committees to form subcommittees to discuss task forces

The average scientist gets their first major grant at age [CITATION: nih-first-r01-age-45].
By then, their best ideas are collecting Social Security.

### The FDA: Keeping You Safe from Being Alive

The Food and Drug Administration takes [TODO: source - exact years] and [TODO: source - cost] to approve a new drug.
During those years:
- [STAT NEEDED: number of people who die waiting]
- The drug company goes bankrupt
- A cheaper alternative is discovered but can't be tested because we're still testing the first one
- Everyone forgets what disease we were trying to cure

It's like having a fire department that takes 17 years to approve water as "safe for fire suppression" while your house burns down.

### The Patent System: Monetizing Misery

Here's how we ensure diseases stay profitable:
1. Company discovers cure for Disease X
2. Patents it for 20 years
3. Charges $100,000 per dose
4. Poor people die
5. Patent expires
6. Generic version could cost $10
7. But by then, Disease X has mutated
8. Start over with Disease X-2: Electric Boogaloo

We've created a system where keeping you sick is worth [TODO: source - pharma profit margins] in annual profits, but curing you is a one-time payment.

Guess which one Wall Street prefers?

## The Three Stooges of Medical Research

### Stooge #1: The Grant System (Larry)

Scientists spend more time begging for money than doing science.
Here's the workflow:

**Month 1-6:** Write grant proposal
**Month 7:** Submit grant
**Month 8-14:** Wait
**Month 15:** Get rejected
**Month 16-21:** Revise and resubmit
**Month 22-28:** Wait again
**Month 29:** Get funding! (If you're in the lucky 19%)
**Month 30-36:** Do actual science
**Month 37:** Start writing next grant proposal

Result: [TODO: source - percentage] of scientific time spent on paperwork, not science.

It's like making Gordon Ramsay spend 80% of his time writing essays about why he should be allowed to cook.

### Stooge #2: The Publishing Racket (Moe)

Scientific journals are a scam that would make Nigerian princes jealous:

1. Scientists do research (free)
2. Scientists write papers (free)
3. Other scientists review papers (free)
4. Journals publish papers (charge $3,000)
5. Journals sell papers back to scientists ($35 per article)
6. Universities pay millions for access to their own research

Total journal industry profits: [TODO: source - journal industry profits]

It's like restaurants making you pay to read your own recipes.

### Stooge #3: Clinical Trial Insanity (Curly)

Want to test if aspirin helps headaches?
Here's what you need:

- [TODO: source - number] pages of protocols
- [TODO: source - cost] in regulatory fees
- [TODO: source - number] different approvals
- [TODO: source - years] of safety testing (for aspirin, which we've used since 1897)
- Exclude 85% of patients because they're too old, too young, too sick, or too human
- Test on the remaining 15% of unusually healthy sick people
- Wonder why it doesn't work in real patients

We test medicines on people who don't represent actual sick people, then act surprised when they don't work on actual sick people.

## The Incentive Structure from Hell

Everyone in the system is perfectly incentivized to not cure diseases:

### Pharmaceutical Companies
- **Cure a disease:** One-time payment, stock price drops
- **Treat symptoms forever:** Infinite money printer go brrrrr
- **Winner:** Treating symptoms

### Researchers
- **Find controversial breakthrough:** Get attacked by peers, lose funding
- **Publish incremental nothing:** Get promoted, tenure, speaking fees
- **Winner:** Incremental nothing

### FDA Regulators
- **Approve drug that kills someone:** Congressional hearing, fired, career over
- **Delay drug that could save millions:** Nobody notices, get promoted
- **Winner:** Delay everything

### Insurance Companies
- **Pay for cures:** Lose money
- **Deny coverage:** Make money
- **Winner:** "Prior authorization required" (translation: go die)

### Politicians
- **Fund actual research:** Boring, no photo ops
- **Create new agencies with acronyms:** Ribbon cutting ceremonies!
- **Winner:** The National Institute for Instituting Institutes (NIII)

## The Mathematics of Dysfunction

Let's add up the inefficiency:

**Input:** 
- $67.5 billion in global medical research [CITATION: global-gov-med-research-spending]
- 1.2 million biomedical researchers [TODO: source - number of researchers]
- 50 years of modern molecular biology

**Output:**
- 0 diseases cured since [TODO: source - smallpox year]
- [TODO: source - number] of FDA-approved drugs (mostly me-too drugs)
- 95% of diseases have zero treatments [TODO: source - rare disease stats]

**Efficiency Rating:** Approximately 0.00%

We've built a machine that converts billions of dollars into paperwork with near-perfect efficiency.

## Why Democracy Makes It Worse

You'd think voters would demand better.
You'd be adorable for thinking that.

Here's why democracy fails at medical research:

### Problem 1: Voters Don't Understand Science

Ask the average voter about CRISPR:
- 5% think it's gene editing
- 20% think it's a new salad
- 75% think it's a government conspiracy

These people vote on science funding.

### Problem 2: Lobbyists Understand Money

- Disease advocacy groups spend [TODO: source - lobbying amounts] on lobbying
- They get [TODO: source - funding increases] in targeted funding
- Diseases with better lobbyists get more money than diseases that kill more people
- [TODO: example - breast cancer vs heart disease funding disparity]

### Problem 3: The 4-Year Attention Span

- Politician promises to "cure cancer"
- Gets elected
- Creates blue-ribbon commission
- Commission recommends more committees
- Next election happens
- New politician promises to "cure cancer"
- Repeat until heat death of universe

Democracy has the attention span of a goldfish on cocaine.

## The Negative Trial Graveyard

Here's the most criminal part: We hide failure.

- Company spends $100 million testing Drug X
- Drug X doesn't work
- Company buries the results
- Other company spends $100 million testing basically-the-same-as-Drug-X
- Also doesn't work
- Also buries results
- Repeat 50 times

Total waste: $5 billion on the same failed idea

If we published negative results, we'd save [TODO: source - amount saved by publishing negative results].
But we don't, because failure doesn't get you promoted.

It's like having 50 people separately discover that touching fire hurts, but nobody tells anyone else.

## The "Rare Disease" Con

95% of diseases are classified as "rare" [TODO: source - rare disease statistics].
"Rare" means:
- Not profitable to cure
- No research funding
- No FDA fast-track
- You die

But here's the scam: "Rare" diseases collectively affect [TODO: source - total rare disease patients] people.
That's not rare. That's common as hell.

We've defined "rare" in a way that lets us ignore most diseases.
It's like saying "murder is rare" because each individual murder only happens once.

## The Academic Circle Jerk

Academic medical research works like this:

1. Professor needs publications for tenure
2. Designs study to confirm what everyone already knows
3. Gets positive results (because duh)
4. Publishes in journal nobody reads
5. Other professors cite it (without reading)
6. Everyone gets promoted
7. Zero patients helped

Impact on actual medicine: 0
Impact on careers: Substantial
Papers published: 2.5 million per year [TODO: source - number of medical papers published]
Papers that matter: Maybe 12

## The Bottom Line: It's Working Perfectly

Here's the dark truth: The system isn't broken.
It's working exactly as designed.

It's designed to:
- Keep scientists busy writing grants (✓)
- Keep regulators avoiding blame (✓)
- Keep pharma companies profitable (✓)
- Keep insurers denying claims (✓)
- Keep politicians getting elected (✓)
- Keep diseases uncured (✓)

Everyone wins!
Except the patients.
But they're too busy dying to complain.

## What Would Actually Work

You want to know what would actually cure diseases?
Here's the recipe we're not allowed to use:

1. **Pay for results, not paperwork:** You cure something, you get paid. You don't, you don't.

2. **Test everything on everyone:** That database of [CITATION: 166-billion-compounds]? Start testing. All of them. Now.

3. **Publish everything immediately:** Success, failure, "we have no idea what happened" - all public, all free, all now.

4. **Let patients choose:** Dying people should be allowed to try experimental treatments without 17 years of forms.

5. **Fire everyone over 45 in leadership:** Not ageist, just practical. They've had their chance. They built this mess.

But we won't do any of this.
Because the system is working perfectly.
Just not for you.
