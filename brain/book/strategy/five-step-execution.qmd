This is the simple, brutal logic of the revolution. It's not a complex, multi-year plan. It's a five-step cascade, a self-reinforcing flywheel that, once started, cannot be stopped.

{{< include ../../figures/five-step-strategy-flowchart.qmd >}}

1.  **VICTORY Bonds:** You raise **`{python} format_billions(TREATY_CAMPAIGN_TOTAL_COST)`** by selling [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) to investors, promising them a `{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` return on the survival of the human race.

2.  **Global Referendum:** You use the money to launch a **[global referendum](../strategy/global-referendum.qmd)**, a political weapon of mass persuasion designed to secure the votes of **280 million people**—the 3.5% of the population that history has shown is the tipping point for irreversible change.

3.  **Legal Lobbying & Super PACs:** You deploy the rest of the war chest to **[buy the politicians](../legal/election-law.qmd)**. With 280 million voters at your back and a budget that dwarfs the defense lobby, you make supporting the treaty the only rational choice.

4.  **The Treaty Passes:** The **[1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** is ratified. The `{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)`-a-year river of cash begins to flow from military budgets to the DIH.

5.  **The Success Spiral:** The DIH funds cures. The cures generate massive public support. The public support creates political pressure to increase the treaty percentage from 1% to 2%, then 5%, then more. Each success feeds the next, creating a permanent, self-reinforcing flywheel that systematically defunds the global war machine and funds the future of human health.

This isn't a plan to ask for change. It's a plan to make change inevitable.
