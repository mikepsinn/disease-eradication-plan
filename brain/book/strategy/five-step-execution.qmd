**How to Pass a Global Treaty in 5 Steps**

{{< include ../../figures/five-step-strategy-flowchart.qmd >}}

## Step 1: VICTORY Bonds

**Raise $1B From Investors**

Remember World War II? America sold war bonds to fund the fight against fascism. People bought them because:

1. They hated Nazis
2. They loved money
3. The government made it patriotic

The strategy applies the same principle to the War on Disease. VICTORY bonds fund the fight against death - with much higher returns than WWII bonds ever offered.

## Step 2: Global Referendum

**Get 280 Million Votes**

Use the bond money to run a massive campaign. 

Get [3.5% of humanity](/brain/book/references.qmd#3-5-rule) to vote yes on "Do you want to not die?" on redirecting 1% of military spending to fund hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials.

## Step 3: Legal Lobbying

**Deploy $1B (ROI: 1,813:1)**

The military-industrial complex spends $1 on lobbying and gets [$1,813 back](/brain/book/references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc) in contracts. It's the best investment in the world, if you don't mind the screaming.

Use the same proven lobbying ROI to build a coalition where everyone profits more from cures than disease.

## Step 4: Super PACs

**Fund Treaty Supporters, Replace Opponents**

Create Super PACs in every country. Not to support candidates, to support math. If your district votes 70% for the treaty and you vote against it, fund your opponent with spreadsheets and bar graphs.

## Step 5: End War and Disease

{{< include ../../figures/success-spiral-flowchart.qmd >}}

Gradually moving toward a world with less and less war and more and more cures:

- **1% Treaty** ($27B) → First major cures → Media attention → More public support
- **2% Treaty** ($54B) → Accelerated breakthroughs → Paradigm shift → Massive momentum
- **5% Treaty** ($135B) → Disease eradication → Victory declared → Universal support
- **50%+ Budget** → Humanity permanently prioritizes healing over killing

## Appendix: Referendums vs. Independent Expenditures

- **Referendums (where binding and timely):** Highest legitimacy; durable mandate; use when national or state mechanisms exist and timelines are practical.
- **Advisory signals (where no referendum):** Run scientifically credible polling or representative citizen assemblies; publish verified tallies per district.
- **Independent expenditures:** Fastest lever to translate district will into votes; pledge support for lawmakers who vote with their district's verified result (and oppose those who defy it), with strict no‑coordination.
- **Hybrid playbook:** Use the global referendum for umbrella mandate; use country/district signals to direct lawful independent expenditures.
