```{python}
#| echo: false
import sys
import os

# Quarto executes from project root (execute-dir: project in _book.yml)
appendix_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'brain', 'book', 'appendix')
if appendix_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, appendix_path)

from economic_parameters import *
```

This isn't about convincing people to be better. It's about making it more profitable for them to do the right thing. The strategy is a simple, brutal sequence of bribes, each one funding the next, creating an unstoppable coalition of pure, unadulterated self-interest.

## 1. The Bribe for Rich People

### Phase 1: Seed Investors ($250-400M Initial Investment)

- **Who:** Wealthy individuals, funds, anchor investors, and the military-industrial complex itself.
- **The Bribe:** The most profitable investment opportunity in human history, modeled on the proven success of [WWII War Bonds](../references.qmd#wwii-war-bonds) but with [venture-capital-level returns](../references.qmd#top-pe-hedge-funds).
- **271.8% Annual Returns:** **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)** offer 10% of redirected military spending (2.7B from $27.2B), delivering returns that crush even the [world's best hedge funds](../references.qmd#top-pe-hedge-funds).
- **Money-Back Guarantee:** Initial funds are protected by an **[Assurance Contract](../appendix/fundraising-strategy.qmd)**, guaranteeing a full refund if fundraising goals are not met.
- **The Result:** Defense contractors and billionaires make more money supporting peace than supporting war. So they support peace.

### The Superior Offer to Military Contractors

1. **They Make More Money:** Direct investment in VICTORY bonds with 271.8%/year returns [beats all alternative investment options](../references.qmd#investment-return-comparison)
2. **They Get Better Security:** A healthier, more stable world is safer than one with overkill capacity creating existential risk
3. **They Protect Their Families:** Their families get diseases too. They'd be better off profiting from funding cures rather than bombs
4. **Repurpose Their Lobbyists:** Instead of hiring new lobbyists, legally incentivize them with better returns to get their existing lobbying apparatus to push for the treaty

## 2. The Bribe for the First Followers

### Phase 2: Campaign Funders ($100-200M for the Referendum)

- **Who:** The first wave of believers—early backers, health advocates, and institutions who want to do more than just invest.
- **The Bribe:** A chance to turn a modest investment into a massive return *and* control the future of global health.
- **What They Fund:** Their money doesn't go to salaries; it goes directly to funding the **[Global Referendum](/brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd)**. This is the war chest we use to bribe the public.
- **What They Get:** In return for funding the campaign, they receive a special class of **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)** that grant them significant governance rights over the $27.2B annual budget once the treaty is signed. They're not just investors; they're the new ruling class of a multi-billion-dollar global health fund.

## 3. The Bribe for Regular People

### Phase 3: Citizens (Global Population)

- **Who:** Global population (targeting [3.5%](../references.qmd#3-5-rule) = 280 million people)
- **The Bribe:** A large grant of **VOTE points** for each referendum vote, your proof that you'll get paid real money. These represent your earned share of the [$16.4T annual peace dividend](../references.qmd#global-violence-costs) unlocked by redirecting military spending, convertible to **VICTORY bonds** after the [1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) is ratified.
- **VOTE Points:** Every person who votes in our **[Global Referendum](/brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd)** gets points. These aren't fake internet points. They represent real money.
- **You Get Paid:** After the treaty passes, those points become real ownership in the $27.2B annual health budget. You helped create it, you get a piece of it.
- **The Result:** Instead of a traditional protest where people wave signs and go home, we create 280 million people who have skin in the game. When 3.5% of the world's population wants something and will get paid for it, politicians listen.

## 4. The Bribe for Politicians

### Phase 4: Politicians ($800M-1.5B Independent Expenditures)

- **Who:** Key legislators in target countries
- **The Bribe:** A package of personal wealth, political power, and a lasting legacy.

### The Superior Offer to Politicians

- **Personal Investment Opportunity:** Politicians and their families can directly invest in [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) that pay better than anything else they can find, including [defense stocks](../references.qmd#investment-return-comparison) and traditional political corruption
- **Campaign Dominance:** Massive independent expenditure support for treaty supporters; equivalent opposition funding for defectors (no coordination)
- **Electoral Insurance:** The 3.5% public mandate makes supporting the treaty the politically safer choice
- **Political Insurance:** A new, highly popular policy platform that lets politicians claim credit for curing diseases and extending lifespans

### What They Get

- **A Personal Political War Chest:** Hand them an undeniable, popular mandate from the Global Referendum. They can use this massive wave of public support to crush their political opponents, consolidate power, and build a legacy. Give them the ultimate political weapon.
- **The Power to Reward Allies:** Signatory leaders gain the right to direct a portion of the DIH's multi-billion-dollar R&D budget to universities and companies **in their home districts**. This is a firehose of cash they can use to create jobs, reward their biggest financial backers, and stand at ribbon-cutting ceremonies for decades.
- **Enriched Elites:** Offer privileged, early access to VICTORY Bonds to a nation's sovereign wealth funds and key financial institutions *contingent on their leader signing the treaty*. This creates a powerful domestic coalition of the nation's wealthiest and most influential players who will pressure their leader to sign the deal that makes them rich.

**The Result:** The choice for any leader is simple: accept a political and financial package that guarantees their power and enriches their allies, or be swept away by a popular movement funded by their own donors. Compliance becomes the only rational choice.

## The Timeline: From Idea to Revolution

This isn't a 20-year plan. This is a hostile takeover of global priorities, executed with the speed of a startup.

1.  **Phase 1 (Months 0-3): The Setup.** We incorporate, lawyer up, and hire a small team of killers.
2.  **Phase 2 (Months 4-36): The Bribe.** We launch the referendum, raise **[$1.0B](/brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** from our new rich friends, and get 280 million people demanding to be paid.
3.  **Phase 3 (Years 3-5): The Endgame.** We use the money and the mandate to force the treaty through. Then the fun begins: spending $27.2B a year putting diseases out of business.

That's it. Three steps. Five years. A new world.
