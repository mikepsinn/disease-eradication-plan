The strategy unfolds in a sequence of bribes, each one funding the next, creating an unstoppable coalition of self-interest.

## 1. The Bribe for Rich People

### Phase 1: Seed Investors ($250-400M Initial Investment)

- **Who:** Wealthy individuals, funds, anchor investors, and the military-industrial complex itself.
- **The Bribe:** The most profitable investment opportunity in human history, modeled on the proven success of [WWII War Bonds](../references.qmd#wwii-war-bonds) but with [venture-capital-level returns](../references.qmd#top-pe-hedge-funds).
- **270% Annual Returns:** **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)** offer 10% of redirected military spending ($2.7B from $27B), delivering returns that crush even the [world's best hedge funds](../references.qmd#top-pe-hedge-funds).
- **Money-Back Guarantee:** Initial funds are protected by an **[Assurance Contract](../appendix/fundraising-strategy.qmd)**, guaranteeing a full refund if fundraising goals are not met.
- **The Result:** Defense contractors and billionaires make more money supporting peace than supporting war. So they support peace.

### The Superior Offer to Military Contractors

1. **They Make More Money:** Direct investment in VICTORY bonds with 270%/year returns [beats all alternative investment options](../references.qmd#investment-return-comparison)
2. **They Get Better Security:** A healthier, more stable world is safer than one with overkill capacity creating existential risk
3. **They Protect Their Families:** Their families get diseases too. They'd be better off profiting from funding cures rather than bombs
4. **Repurpose Their Lobbyists:** Instead of hiring new lobbyists, legally incentivize them with better returns to get their existing lobbying apparatus to push for the treaty

## 2. The Bribe for VICTORY Bond Buyers

### Phase 2: VICTORY Bond Buyers ($100-200M Referendum Funding)

- **Who:** Early backers, health advocates, institutions
- **The Bribe:** VICTORY bonds representing earned ownership of real economic value created by the peace dividend
- **Governance control over $27B annually** in captured value from military budget redirection
- **Voting rights** on patient subsidies and research funding allocation
- **Bond value backed by actual treasury growth** from when the treaty actually happens ($0 → $27B)

## 3. The Bribe for Regular People

### Phase 3: Citizens (Global Population)

- **Who:** Global population (targeting [3.5%](../references.qmd#3-5-rule) = 280 million people)
- **The Bribe:** A large grant of **VOTE points** for each referendum vote, your proof that you'll get paid real money. These represent your earned share of the [$16.5 trillion annual peace dividend](../references.qmd#global-violence-costs) unlocked by redirecting military spending, convertible to **VICTORY bonds** after the [1% Treaty](../appendix/1-percent-treaty.qmd) is ratified.
- **VOTE Points:** Every person who votes in our **[Global Referendum](/brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd)** gets points. These aren't fake internet points. They represent real money.
- **You Get Paid:** After the treaty passes, those points become real ownership in the $27 billion annual health budget. You helped create it, you get a piece of it.
- **The Result:** Instead of a traditional protest where people wave signs and go home, we create 280 million people who have skin in the game. When 3.5% of the world's population wants something and will get paid for it, politicians listen.

## 4. The Bribe for Politicians

### Phase 4: Politicians ($800M-1.5B Independent Expenditures)

- **Who:** Key legislators in target countries
- **The Bribe:** A package of personal wealth, political power, and a lasting legacy.

### The Superior Offer to Politicians

- **Personal Investment Opportunity:** Politicians and their families can directly invest in [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) that pay better than anything else they can find, including [defense stocks](../references.qmd#investment-return-comparison) and traditional political corruption
- **Campaign Dominance:** Massive independent expenditure support for treaty supporters; equivalent opposition funding for defectors (no coordination)
- **Electoral Insurance:** The 3.5% public mandate makes supporting the treaty the politically safer choice
- **Political Insurance:** A new, highly popular policy platform that lets politicians claim credit for curing diseases and extending lifespans

### What They Get

- **A Personal Political War Chest:** Hand them an undeniable, popular mandate from the Global Referendum. They can use this massive wave of public support to crush their political opponents, consolidate power, and build a legacy. Give them the ultimate political weapon.
- **The Power to Reward Allies:** Signatory leaders gain the right to direct a portion of the DIH's multi-billion-dollar R&D budget to universities and companies **in their home districts**. This is a firehose of cash they can use to create jobs, reward their biggest financial backers, and stand at ribbon-cutting ceremonies for decades.
- **Enriched Elites:** Offer privileged, early access to VICTORY Bonds to a nation's sovereign wealth funds and key financial institutions _contingent on their leader signing the treaty_. This creates a powerful domestic coalition of the nation's wealthiest and most influential players who will pressure their leader to sign the deal that makes them rich.

**The Result:** The choice for a leader is simple: accept a political and financial package that guarantees their personal power and enriches their allies, or be swept away by the tide. Compliance becomes the only rational choice.

## The Timeline

Here's how to execute it:

1.  **Months 0-3:** Set up the legal structure and hire smart people to run the campaign.
2.  **Months 4-36:** Launch the global referendum to get 280 million people to vote, and raise **[$1 billion](/brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** from investors.
3.  **Years 3-5:** Use the mandate and money to get major countries to sign the treaty, then start spending $27 billion per year on curing diseases.

That's it.
