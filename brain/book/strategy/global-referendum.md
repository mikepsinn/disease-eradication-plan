# Global Referendum Strategy

A cryptographically secure, on-chain list of 280 million verified supporters is not an "analogy"; it is the largest, most powerful political mandate in human history. Here's how we build it.

## Objective & Principles

### Primary Objective

Implement a privacy-preserving, globally verifiable referendum to assess public support for the 1% Treaty and DIH. Outputs must be auditable and persuasive to policymakers while achieving the **3.5% global participation threshold** (280M+ verified votes).

### Core Principles

- **Verifiability**: End-to-end cryptographic proofs of inclusion and tally correctness
- **Privacy**: Ballot secrecy with minimal personal data collection
- **Equity**: Strong Sybil resistance without excluding the unbanked or undocumented
- **Transparency**: Open-source code, public audits, post-election publish of artifacts
- **Viral Growth**: Cost-effective acquisition targeting <$0.50 per verified pledge

## System Architecture & Implementation

### Voting Protocol

**End-to-End Verifiable System:**
- Use an end-to-end verifiable scheme (Helios or similar) with individual ballot verification and public bulletin board
- **Individual Ballot Verification**: Each voter receives cryptographic receipt
- **Public Bulletin Board**: All ballots published (anonymized) for public audit
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove vote validity without revealing vote content
- **Mixnet Anonymization**: Remove linkage between voter identity and ballot choice
