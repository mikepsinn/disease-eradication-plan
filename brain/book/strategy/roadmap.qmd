## The Unified Strategy: A 36-Month Plan from Concept to Global Impact

This document is the strategic blueprint for executing the financial and political strategy outlined in the main overview. While the core mission is to achieve the 1% Treaty with minimal long-term effort from the core team, this roadmap details the necessary, front-loaded work required to build the political and financial leverage to make that possible.

It outlines the comprehensive, multi-phase plan that integrates the financial, operational, and philanthropic strategies.

### Operational Philosophy: Start Small, Then Disappear

The core philosophy is to hire a few very smart people to build the system, then get out of the way. Victory is achieved when the system works without central management.

### High-Level Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Unlike government programs that hide failure, we measure success transparently. These are the long-term targets the entire roadmap is designed to achieve.

#### Year 1 Targets

- 1,000+ active trials launched
- 100,000+ patients enrolled
- 10+ diseases with breakthrough treatments
- `{python} format_percentage(TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_PCT)` reduction in trial costs demonstrated
- $1B+ in researcher revenue generated

#### Year 5 Targets

- 10,000+ active trials
- 10M+ patients enrolled
- 100+ diseases with new treatments
- 90% reduction in trial costs
- $10B+ researcher revenue
- 5+ diseases completely cured

#### Year 10 Targets

- 100,000+ active trials
- 100M+ patients enrolled
- 1,000+ diseases with treatments
- 95% trial cost reduction
- $100B+ researcher revenue
- 50+ diseases cured
- Aging reversed in humans

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Months 1-3)

**Goal:** Validate core assumptions before scaling. Can you actually get people to sign the treaty? Will investors fund political arbitrage? Can the tech work at scale?

**Team Composition (3-5 people):**
- Founder/CEO (full-time, equity)
- Head of Growth (marketing/viral mechanics, contract-to-hire)
- Full-Stack Engineer (build the MVP, contract)
- Legal/Compliance Advisor (part-time, $200/hr)
- Angel Investor Lead (unpaid, equity participation)

**Tactical Execution:**

1. **Week 1-2**: Incorporate Delaware C-Corp, open bank account, set up cap table
2. **Week 3-6**: Build Wishocracy voting widget MVP (React frontend + Supabase backend, ~$15k contractor)
3. **Week 7-8**: Launch beta with 100 friends/family, measure engagement (target: 70%+ completion rate)
4. **Week 9-10**: Pitch 20 angels, convert 5 at $100k each ($500k total)
5. **Week 11-12**: Launch referendum platform V1 with referral mechanics

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- User engagement: 70%+ complete voting session (below 50% = redesign needed)
- Referral rate: 15%+ users recruit at least 1 friend (network effects test)
- Investor interest: 25%+ pitch-to-close ratio (validates arbitrage thesis)
- Technical validation: Platform handles 10K concurrent users without crashing
- Verified votes: 10,000 within 30 days (proves concept, calculates CAC)

**Critical Risks & Mitigation:**
- *Risk*: Nobody cares about signing a treaty → *Mitigation*: Test 3 different value propositions (save lives, make money, fix democracy) and double down on winner
- *Risk*: Platform can't verify identities → *Mitigation*: Start with lightweight verification (email + phone), build toward biometric later
- *Risk*: Investors see it as charity, not investment → *Mitigation*: Lead pitch with `{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` returns and treaty adoption game theory, not emotional appeal

---

### Phase 2: Scale & Lobby (Months 4-18)

**Goal:** Build viral referendum momentum and establish lobbying beachheads in 5 pilot countries. Prove the system can scale globally and move politicians.

**Team Composition (18-22 people):**
- Executive team: CEO, COO, CTO, Chief Legal Officer (4)
- Engineering: 4 full-stack engineers, 1 DevOps, 1 Security (6)
- Growth: Head of Growth, 2 growth marketers, 1 data analyst (4)
- Political ops: Head of Government Affairs, 3 regional lobbyists (4)
- Operations: 1 Finance/Admin, 1 Compliance Manager, 1 People Ops (3)
- Board advisors: 1 former regulator, 1 defense contractor exec, 1 tech founder (unpaid)

**Tactical Execution:**

1. **Months 4-6**: Close $35M Series A (target 15-20 VCs, emphasize political arbitrage + `{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` bond returns)
2. **Months 7-9**: Scale engineering team, build production platform v2 with full KYC/identity verification
3. **Months 10-12**: Launch viral referral program with $0.20/vote incentives in 3 pilot countries (start with friendly nations: Switzerland, Singapore, Estonia)
4. **Months 13-15**: Hire lobbying firms in 5 key countries (US, UK, Germany, Japan, South Korea), coordinate messaging
5. **Months 16-18**: Run first political pressure campaigns, demonstrate that referendum numbers translate to politician behavior change

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- Fundraising: $35M Series A raised (validates growth trajectory)
- Platform scaling: Handle 500K concurrent users, 99.9% uptime
- User acquisition: Reach 50M verified votes (CAC target: $0.50 with referral mechanics)
- Viral coefficient (k-factor): Achieve 1.3+ (exponential organic growth)
- Lobbying effectiveness: Get 5 politicians to publicly support the treaty (proof of concept)
- Media coverage: 100+ major media mentions (NYT, WSJ, BBC, etc.)
- Pilot country traction: 10%+ population in at least one small country (<5M population)

**Critical Risks & Mitigation:**
- *Risk*: Series A falls through → *Mitigation*: Close $2M bridge from angels, extend runway, demonstrate traction first
- *Risk*: Platform can't scale technically → *Mitigation*: Use proven infrastructure (AWS/GCP), bring in fractional CTO with scaling experience
- *Risk*: Referral fraud (fake votes) → *Mitigation*: Multi-factor identity verification (ID + biometric + phone), fraud detection algorithms, manual review of suspicious accounts
- *Risk*: Politicians ignore referendum numbers → *Mitigation*: Target vulnerable seats in swing districts, demonstrate we can swing elections with independent expenditures
- *Risk*: Foreign election law violations → *Mitigation*: Hire local legal counsel in each country before spending dollar one, firewall US operations from international

### Phase 3: Bond Offering & Treaty Push (Months 19-36)

**Goal:** Execute the `{python} format_billions(CAMPAIGN_TOTAL_COST)` bond raise, overwhelm political opposition with money and public pressure, and secure first G7 treaty ratification. This is the final battle.

**Team Composition (50-75 people):**
- Executive team: Same 4 + CFO for bond offering (5)
- Engineering/Product: Scale to 10 engineers, 2 designers, 2 PMs (14)
- Political operations: 20 lobbyists across 15 countries + 5 political strategists (25)
- Growth/Marketing: Scale to 8-person growth team + 5 content creators (13)
- Legal/Compliance: 4 full-time lawyers + outside counsel (4)
- Operations/Finance: CFO, 3 finance analysts, 2 HR, 2 IT/ops (8)
- Bond offering team: Investment bankers (contract), SEC lawyers (contract)

**Tactical Execution:**

1. **Months 19-21**: Launch VICTORY bond offering (Reg D 506b for accredited investors, target $500M first close)
2. **Months 22-24**: Deploy $250M to lobbying campaigns in 20 key countries, hire top K-Street firms.
3. **Months 25-27**: Scale referendum to 280M votes via $200M viral marketing campaign.
4. **Months 28-30**: As part of the lobbying effort, execute targeted independent expenditure campaigns, deploying $50M in 10 swing districts to demonstrate electoral power.
5. **Months 31-33**: Coordinate simultaneous treaty introduction in 5 G7 nations (use carrot: development aid, stick: electoral defeat)
6. **Months 34-36**: Secure first G7 ratification, trigger cascade effect with smaller nations following

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- Fundraising: $1B VICTORY bond sale (first $500M within 90 days validates demand)
- Bond Terms: Secure `{python} format_billions(CAMPAIGN_TOTAL_COST)` raise on terms of bondholders receiving 10% of all future treaty inflows in perpetuity.
- Projected Yield: Successfully communicate the projected `{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` annual yield to investors (based on a `{python} format_billions(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_PAYOUT)` payout from a `{python} format_billions(CAPTURED_DIVIDEND)` treaty).
- Referendum scale: 280M votes (3.5% global population = unstoppable political pressure)
- Lobbying ROI: $250M spent → 100+ politicians publicly supporting (cost per politician: $2.5M)
- Electoral demonstration: Win or swing 5+ elections with independent expenditures (proves electoral threat is real)
- Treaty traction: 20+ nations with pending legislation, 5+ with serious committee consideration
- G7 ratification: At least 1 G7 nation (US, UK, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, Italy) ratifies treaty

**Critical Risks & Mitigation:**
- *Risk*: Bond offering fails (can't raise `{python} format_billions(CAMPAIGN_TOTAL_COST)`) → *Mitigation*: Do $500M first close to prove concept, then $500M second close; accept slower timeline if needed; offer better terms (12% instead of 10%)
- *Risk*: SEC blocks bond offering → *Mitigation*: Full Reg D compliance from day 1, hire top securities lawyers, file months in advance, have backup offshore offering ready
- *Risk*: Opposition outspends us ($300M defense lobby → $500M) → *Mitigation*: Don't match dollar-for-dollar; use smarter targeting (swing districts), co-opt their lobbyists with VICTORY bonds, make it more profitable to support us
- *Risk*: First treaty vote fails publicly → *Mitigation*: Never bring treaty to vote unless you have the votes counted; start with friendly small countries (Iceland, Estonia, Singapore) to build momentum before tackling G7
- *Risk*: Media backlash ("foreign money buying elections") → *Mitigation*: US political operations 100% US-funded and firewalled, emphasize grassroots referendum support (280M people), make opponents look like they're opposing public will
- *Risk*: Team burnout/attrition in high-pressure campaign → *Mitigation*: Competitive pay (top 10% for role), clear equity/bonus tied to treaty success, strong culture of mission-driven work, hire for resilience

**Note**: Executing this roadmap requires a hybrid legal structure (501c3, 501c4, C-Corp, Swiss Foundation) to handle the different types of funding and operations. The complete legal architecture is detailed in [The Right Tools for the Job: A Hybrid Legal Architecture](../legal/legal-framework.qmd).

### Risk Management & Mitigation

* **Execution Risk:** Mitigated by hiring a small, elite team and leveraging an advisory board of experts.
* **Timeline Risk:** Mitigated by a phased approach with clear gates and early wins in smaller countries.
* **Legal & Political Risk:** Mitigated by a multi-jurisdiction compliance strategy from Day 1 and the use of massive financial incentives to align political actors.
* **Capture/Corruption Risk:** Mitigated by transparent, algorithmic allocation of funds based on verifiable health outcomes.
