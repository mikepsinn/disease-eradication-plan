So, you've seen the problem and the solution. Now for the hard part: how to actually pull it off.

This isn't a vague call to "raise awareness." This is a detailed, 36-month roadmap to execute the most ambitious political and financial arbitrage in human history. You're not just asking for change; you're building the machine that makes change inevitable.

Here's the high-level strategy.

### The Financial Roadmap: From $0 to a Billion-Dollar War Chest

You want to end war and disease. You need a `{python} format_billions(TREATY_CAMPAIGN_TOTAL_COST)` war chest. You have $0. Here's how you get it.

1.  **Phase 1: The Proof of Concept (Months 1-3).** First, you prove the core idea works on a small scale. You build a simple version of the **[Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd)** and see if anyone actually uses it. You use that initial traction to raise a small seed round from angel investors who understand the brutal math of political arbitrage: bet a little to make a lot.
2.  **Phase 2: Scale and Lobby (Months 4-18).** With proof that people will vote and investors will invest, you raise a larger venture round. This money scales the referendum to millions of users and hires the first professional lobbyists. The goal is to prove that your growing army of voters can be aimed at politicians to make them listen.
3.  **Phase 3: The Bond Offering (Months 19-36).** This is the final boss. You launch the **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**, a high-risk, high-return investment vehicle designed to raise the full `{python} format_billions(TREATY_CAMPAIGN_TOTAL_COST)`. This is the money you use to overwhelm the opposition, run a global media blitz, and get the **[1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** signed.

### The Legal Architecture: How to Be a Charity, a Lobbying Group, and a Hedge Fund at the Same Time

To win, you need to fight on three fronts: moral (charity), political (lobbying), and financial (investment). The problem is, legally, no single organization can do all three.

So, you build a hybrid machine.

-   **The Charity (501c3):** This is the "brains." It does the research and education, and it's where big foundations can make tax-deductible donations.
-   **The Lobbying Group (501c4):** This is the "sword." It takes the research from the charity and uses it to wage unlimited political warfare.
-   **The Corporation (C-Corp):** This is the "engine." It's a for-profit entity that issues the VICTORY Bonds and funds the whole operation.
-   **The Swiss Foundation:** This is the "soul." It's the parent organization that owns the corporation, ensuring its profits can only ever be used for the mission.

This structure lets you legally accept money from everyone—foundations, political donors, and Wall Street—and aim it all at the same target.

### The Political Strategy: Co-Opt, Don't Compete

You cannot outspend the military-industrial complex in a head-to-head fight. So you don't. You bribe them.

The strategy is simple: make it more profitable for everyone—defense contractors, politicians, insurance companies—to support the treaty than to oppose it. You use the `{python} format_billions(TREATY_CAMPAIGN_TOTAL_COST)` from the VICTORY Bonds to offer a better deal. Their lobbyists become your lobbyists. Their political action committees become your political action committees.

You combine this financial jujitsu with the overwhelming public pressure from 280 million verified voters in the global referendum. The choice for a politician becomes simple: side with the public and get rich, or side with the status quo and get voted out.
