The strategy is a simple, three-step algorithm for suggesting that the current arrangement might not be optimal.

### Step 1: Acquire Capital

Raise **$1.0B** by selling **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**. The pitch: a perpetual **271.8% annual return**, funded by redirecting a tiny fraction of the global war machine's budget. The returns substantially exceed comparable investments.

### Step 2: Align Incentives

Use the capital to launch a **[global referendum](../strategy/global-referendum.qmd)** and compensate the public for their participation. The goal: get **280 million people** (3.5% of the global population) to vote YES. This isn't a petition; it's a gentle reminder that voters exist. History shows that no government on earth can withstand the sustained attention of 3.5% of its population.

### Step 3: Execute the Transition

Use the public mandate and the remaining capital to **[fund political support for the treaty](../legal/election-law.qmd)**. With 280 million voters and a budget roughly comparable to defense lobbying expenditures, supporting the treaty becomes the rational choice for any politician interested in remaining employed.

The result follows logically: the **[1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** is ratified. The $27.2B-a-year river of cash is unlocked. Forever.

## Detailed Execution: The Five-Step Cascade


{{< include ../../figures/five-step-strategy-flowchart.qmd >}}

1.  **VICTORY Bonds:** You raise **$1.0B** by selling [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) to investors, promising them a 271.8% return on the survival of the human race.

2.  **Global Referendum:** You use the money to launch a **[global referendum](../strategy/global-referendum.qmd)**, a political weapon of mass persuasion designed to secure the votes of **280 million people**—the 3.5% of the population that history has shown is the tipping point for irreversible change.

3.  **Legal Lobbying & Super PACs:** You deploy the rest of the war chest to **[buy the politicians](../legal/election-law.qmd)**. With 280 million voters at your back and a budget that dwarfs the defense lobby, you make supporting the treaty the only rational choice.

4.  **The Treaty Passes:** The **[1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** is ratified. The $27.2B-a-year river of cash begins to flow from military budgets to the DIH.

5.  **The Success Spiral:** The DIH funds cures. The cures generate massive public support. The public support creates political pressure to increase the treaty percentage from 1% to 2%, then 5%, then more. Each success feeds the next, creating a permanent, self-reinforcing flywheel that systematically defunds the global war machine and funds the future of human health.

This isn't a plan to ask for change. It's a plan to make change inevitable.

## Tactical Implementation: The Bribe Sequence

This isn't about convincing people to be better. It's about making it more profitable for them to do the right thing. The strategy is a simple, brutal sequence of bribes, each one funding the next, creating an unstoppable coalition of pure, unadulterated self-interest.

### 1. The Bribe for Rich People

#### Phase 1: Seed Investors ($250-400M Initial Investment)

- **Who:** Wealthy individuals, funds, anchor investors, and the military-industrial complex itself.
- **The Bribe:** The most profitable investment opportunity in human history, modeled on the proven success of [WWII War Bonds](../references.qmd#wwii-war-bonds) but with [venture-capital-level returns](../references.qmd#top-pe-hedge-funds).
- **271.8% Annual Returns:** **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)** offer 10% of redirected military spending (2.7B from $27.2B), delivering returns that crush even the [world's best hedge funds](../references.qmd#top-pe-hedge-funds).
- **Money-Back Guarantee:** Initial funds are protected by an **[Assurance Contract](../appendix/fundraising-strategy.qmd)**, guaranteeing a full refund if fundraising goals are not met.
- **The Result:** Defense contractors and billionaires make more money supporting peace than supporting war. So they support peace.

#### The Superior Offer to Military Contractors

1. **They Make More Money:** Direct investment in VICTORY bonds with 271.8%/year returns [beats all alternative investment options](../references.qmd#investment-return-comparison)
2. **They Get Better Security:** A healthier, more stable world is safer than one with overkill capacity creating existential risk
3. **They Protect Their Families:** Their families get diseases too. They'd be better off profiting from funding cures rather than bombs
4. **Repurpose Their Lobbyists:** Instead of hiring new lobbyists, legally incentivize them with better returns to get their existing lobbying apparatus to push for the treaty

### 2. The Bribe for the First Followers

#### Phase 2: Campaign Funders ($100-200M for the Referendum)

- **Who:** The first wave of believers, early backers, health advocates, and institutions who want to do more than just invest.
- **The Bribe:** A chance to turn a modest investment into a massive return *and* control the future of global health.
- **What They Fund:** Their money doesn't go to salaries; it goes directly to funding the **[Global Referendum](../strategy/global-referendum.qmd)**. This is the war chest you use to bribe the public.
- **What They Get:** In return for funding the campaign, they receive a special class of **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)** that grant them significant governance rights over the $27.2B annual budget once the treaty is signed. They're not just investors; they're the new ruling class of a multi-billion-dollar global health fund.

### 3. The Bribe for Regular People

#### Phase 3: Citizens (Global Population)

- **Who:** Global population (targeting [3.5%](../references.qmd#3-5-rule) = 280 million people)
- **The Bribe:** A large grant of **VOTE points** for each referendum vote, your proof that you'll get paid real money. These represent your earned share of the [$16.4T annual peace dividend](../references.qmd#global-violence-costs) unlocked by redirecting military spending, convertible to **VICTORY bonds** after the [1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) is ratified.
- **VOTE Points:** Every person who votes in the **[Global Referendum](../strategy/global-referendum.qmd)** gets points. These aren't fake internet points. They represent real money.
- **You Get Paid:** After the treaty passes, those points become real ownership in the $27.2B annual health budget. You helped create it, you get a piece of it.
- **The Result:** Instead of a traditional protest where people wave signs and go home, you create 280 million people who have skin in the game. When 3.5% of the world's population wants something and will get paid for it, politicians listen.

### 4. The Bribe for Politicians

#### Phase 4: Politicians ($800M-1.5B Independent Expenditures)

- **Who:** Key legislators in target countries
- **The Bribe:** A package of personal wealth, political power, and a lasting legacy.

#### The Superior Offer to Politicians

- **Personal Investment Opportunity:** Politicians and their families can directly invest in [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) that pay better than anything else they can find, including [defense stocks](../references.qmd#investment-return-comparison) and traditional political corruption
- **Campaign Dominance:** Massive independent expenditure support for treaty supporters; equivalent opposition funding for defectors (no coordination)
- **Electoral Insurance:** The 3.5% public mandate makes supporting the treaty the politically safer choice
- **Political Insurance:** A new, highly popular policy platform that lets politicians claim credit for curing diseases and extending lifespans

#### What They Get

- **A Personal Political War Chest:** Hand them an undeniable, popular mandate from the Global Referendum. They can use this massive wave of public support to crush their political opponents, consolidate power, and build a legacy. Give them the ultimate political weapon.
- **The Power to Reward Allies:** Signatory leaders gain the right to direct a portion of the DIH's multi-billion-dollar R&D budget to universities and companies **in their home districts**. This is a firehose of cash they can use to create jobs, reward their biggest financial backers, and stand at ribbon-cutting ceremonies for decades.
- **Enriched Elites:** Offer privileged, early access to VICTORY Bonds to a nation's sovereign wealth funds and key financial institutions *contingent on their leader signing the treaty*. This creates a powerful domestic coalition of the nation's wealthiest and most influential players who will pressure their leader to sign the deal that makes them rich.

**The Result:** The choice for any leader is simple: accept a political and financial package that guarantees their power and enriches their allies, or be swept away by a popular movement funded by their own donors. Compliance becomes the only rational choice.

## The Timeline: From Idea to Revolution

This is a hostile takeover of global priorities in 3-5 years.

1.  **Phase 1 (Months 0-3): The Setup.** Incorporate, lawyer up, and hire a small team of killers.
2.  **Phase 2 (Months 4-36): The Bribe.** Launch the referendum, raise **[$1.0B](../economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** from new rich friends, and get 280 million people demanding to be paid.
3.  **Phase 3 (Years 3-5): The Endgame.** Use the money and the mandate to force the treaty through. Then the fun begins: spending $27.2B a year putting diseases out of business.

Three steps. Five years.
