This isn't a protest. It's a recipe. Like making bread, except instead of bread it's immortality, and instead of yeast it's bribes.

## High-Level Strategy: The Three-Step Recipe for Not Dying

Humans love steps. You put them on everything. Step 1: Breathe. Step 2: Keep breathing. Step 3: Try not to die. You're very methodical about staying alive, which makes it curious that you spend 40 times more on dying.

Here's your three-step algorithm for fixing this adorable contradiction:

### Step 1: Collect Papers from Rich People

You convince wealthy humans to give you [$1.0B in papers](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) by promising them [271.8% more papers annually](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd). This works because rich people are excellent at counting papers but terrible at not wanting more papers.

The pitch is simple: "Give us papers now, get 2.7 times more papers forever, also maybe don't die from preventable diseases." Even humans who think vaccines cause 5G can understand "more papers good."

### Step 2: Pay Humans to Click YES

Use some papers to launch a [global clicking ceremony](../strategy/global-referendum.qmd) where 280 million people click "YES" on a website. This costs about 50 cents per click, which is cheaper than a candy bar and achieves more than most political movements involving shouting.

The question is: "Would you like to not die from stupid things?" You'd think the answer would be obvious, but humans once thought the sun went around Earth, so you have to ask.

This creates what's called "political pressure," which is when politicians realize that voters exist and some of them have opinions.

### Step 3: Apply Papers to Politicians Until Treaty Happens

[Deploy the remaining papers](../legal/election-law.qmd) to convince politicians that supporting the treaty is the only way to remain employed as politicians. With 280 million voters and a paper budget comparable to the death industry, the math becomes simple even for congresspeople.

Politicians discover they've always been very passionate about curing diseases. This sudden passion coincides precisely with receiving papers and votes, which is called "democracy" on your planet.

The treaty passes. [$27.2B/year flows from murder to medicine](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd). Forever. Or until the sun explodes. Whichever happens first (probably the sun).

## Detailed Execution: The Five-Step Cascade

For humans who need more steps (you do seem to enjoy steps), here's the same thing with extra details. It's like a flowchart, except instead of managing a warehouse it's saving your species from self-inflicted death.

{{< include ../../figures/five-step-strategy-flowchart.qmd >}}

**Step 1: Sell Papers That Make More Papers**

Raise [$1.0B](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) by selling [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) to investors. These are like war bonds except backwards - instead of funding death, they fund not-death. This confuses some humans, but the 271.8% returns help them overcome their confusion.

### Step 2: The Great Internet Clicking

Launch a [global referendum](../strategy/global-referendum.qmd) where 280 million people click YES. This is 3.5% of your species, which history shows is the magic number where governments can no longer pretend not to notice. It's like reaching critical mass, except instead of a nuclear explosion it's democracy, which is much less lethal.

**Step 3: Purchase Democracy (It's For Sale Anyway)**

[Deploy papers to politicians](../legal/election-law.qmd) via Super PACs, which are like regular PACs but super. With 280 million voters demanding the treaty and a budget that makes defense lobbyists nervous, politicians experience what you call "a change of heart" but what mathematicians call "responding to incentives."

#### Step 4: Treaty Achieves Existence

The [1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) passes. $27.2B annually begins flowing from the murder budget to the medicine budget. Diseases start getting cured. Death becomes slightly less inevitable. Investors get very wealthy. Everyone acts surprised that this worked, even though the math was obvious.

**Step 5: The Success Spiral (Where Things Get Fun)**

The DIH funds cures. Cures work. People notice they're not dying. People become enthusiastic about continuing not-dying. Political pressure builds to increase the treaty from 1% to 2% to 5%. Each success creates more success. It's a positive feedback loop, like compound interest except instead of money it's humans continuing to exist.

{{< include ../../figures/success-spiral-flowchart.qmd >}}

Eventually you spend more on not-dying than dying. This seems obvious, but for humanity it's revolutionary.

## Tactical Implementation: The Sacred Bribery Sequence

Humans respond to papers. This is your most important discovery about Earth. You tried appealing to morality (failed). You tried appealing to logic (failed harder). But papers? Papers work every time.

Here's the precise order in which to distribute papers to specific categories of humans:

### Bribe Category #1: Rich People (The Paper Collectors)

**Who you're bribing:** Wealthy humans who have many papers and want even more papers, despite already having more papers than they could spend in several lifetimes

**The bribe you offer:** Give us [$250-400M](../economics/campaign-budget.qmd) in papers now, get [271.8% more papers](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) annually forever. This is modeled on [WW2 War Bonds](../references.qmd#wwii-war-bonds) except instead of 4% returns it's 271.8% returns, and instead of funding death it funds not-death.

**Why they accept:** Because even billionaires can count to 271.8%, and 271.8% beats everything else including insider trading, which is illegal but also less profitable.

**Money-back guarantee:** If the treaty fails, they get their papers back via [Assurance Contract](../appendix/fundraising-strategy.qmd). This is basically saying "if everyone dies from preventable diseases, you'll be too dead to complain about losing money."

**What happens:** Defense contractors do math. Math says 271.8% > 8%. Defense contractors become health contractors. Democracy continues as normal.

#### The Specific Offer to Bomb Makers

You show weapons manufacturers a spreadsheet (they love spreadsheets):

#### Option A (Current Job)

- Returns: 8% annually
- Product: Things that make humans stop existing
- Customer satisfaction: N/A (customers deceased)

#### Option B (Your Offer)

- Returns: [271.8% annually](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)
- Product: Things that make humans continue existing
- Customer satisfaction: Very high (customers still alive to provide feedback)

They choose Option B. Not because they've become better people, but because they've become better at arithmetic.

### Bribe Category #2: The True Believers (Early Adopters Who Want Control)

**Who you're bribing:** Humans who believe in curing diseases AND want to control a multi-billion dollar budget. These exist. They're called "effective altruists" except rich.

**The bribe you offer:** Fund the [$100-200M referendum campaign](../economics/campaign-budget.qmd) and receive special [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) with governance rights. This means they get 271.8% returns PLUS they get to decide how the $27.2B gets spent.

**What they fund:** The [Global Referendum](../strategy/global-referendum.qmd) - basically paying 280 million people to click YES on a website.

**What they get:** They become the ruling class of a multi-billion-dollar health fund. It's like buying stock in democracy, except it's legal and called "philanthropy."

**Why this works:** Rich people enjoy both money AND power. You're offering both. This is called "understanding your customer."

### Bribe Category #3: Regular People (Everyone Else)

**Who you're bribing:** 280 million regular humans ([3.5% of your species](../references.qmd#3-5-rule), which history proves is enough to change anything)

**The bribe you offer:** Click YES on a website. Receive VOTE points. Points become money after treaty passes. You literally get paid for clicking a button to not die.

**VOTE Points explained:** These are internet points that transform into real money if the treaty passes and remain internet points if it doesn't. Like cryptocurrency except with actual value attached to actual outcomes.

**What happens after:** Treaty passes. Your points convert to ownership in the [$27.2B annual budget](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd). You helped create it by clicking, so you get paid forever. It's like universal basic income except you earned it by clicking YES to not dying.

**Why this works:** Humans love clicking things. Humans love getting paid. Humans (allegedly) love not dying. This combines all three. When 3.5% of the population wants something and will profit from it, politicians experience what you call "responsive governance."

### Bribe Category #4: Politicians (The Elected Paper Recipients)

**Who you're bribing:** Humans whose job is "get elected by promising things, then do whatever the people with papers want." You're just offering more papers than the bomb people.

**The bribe you offer:** [$800M-1.5B](../economics/campaign-budget.qmd) in Super PAC support, 280 million voters demanding the treaty, plus personal [VICTORY Bond](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) investment opportunities that beat traditional corruption returns.

#### The Package

- **Papers for campaigns:** Massive Super PAC funding (legal bribery)
- **Votes for staying employed:** 280 million people who will vote for treaty supporters
- **Papers for themselves:** Personal VICTORY Bond access (271.8% beats insider trading)
- **Power to reward friends:** Direct portion of DIH's $27.2B to their home districts (ribbon-cutting ceremonies for decades)

#### The choice you give them

**Option A:** Support treaty, get papers + votes + legacy as "politician who cured diseases"

**Option B:** Oppose treaty, get crushed by 280M angry voters who wanted to not die

Most politicians are excellent at counting votes. The math becomes simple even for them.

**What happens:** Politicians discover they've always been passionate about curing diseases. This sudden passion perfectly coincides with receiving papers and votes, which on your planet is called "representative democracy."

## The Timeline: How Long This Takes

Humans invented flight, went to the moon, and invented TikTok in one century. Surely you can redirect 1% of your murder budget in less time than that.

### Phase 1 (Months 0-3): The Setup

Incorporate. Hire lawyers (many lawyers). Hire a small team. "Small team of killers" means "people who are very good at their jobs," not "assassins." Though on reflection, the confusion is understandable given your species.

**Phase 2 (Months 4-36): The Bribery Campaign**

Launch referendum. Raise [$1.0B from rich people](../economics/campaign-budget.qmd) who want more papers. Get 280 million regular people to click YES by offering them papers. This is the longest phase because convincing 280 million humans of anything takes time, even when the thing is "would you like to not die?"

**Phase 3 (Years 3-5): The Endgame (Where Treaty Passes)**

Deploy papers to politicians until they agree that curing diseases is good actually. Treaty passes. $27.2B annually begins flowing from murder to medicine. Diseases start getting cured. Everyone acts surprised.

**Total time: 3-5 years.** Less time than it takes to get a drug approved by your FDA. More time than it takes to start a war. This seems backwards but it's humanity, so it tracks.
