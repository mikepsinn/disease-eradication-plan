## The Goal: 280 Million Votes

Historical analysis shows: Every peaceful movement that gets **3.5% active support** succeeds.

- 8 billion humans × 3.5% = 280 million
- We need 280 million people to vote YES on the 1% Treaty
- That's achievable. Here's how.

## The Message That Spreads

### What Doesn't Go Viral
- "Please donate to medical research" (boring)
- "Policy proposal for healthcare reform" (sleep-inducing)
- "Consider supporting this initiative" (ignored)

### What Does Go Viral
- "We have 13,000 nukes but no cure for your kid's cancer" (rage-inducing)
- "You're spending $337/year on killing people, $8/year on curing them" (shocking)
- "270% investment returns while saving humanity" (greed + altruism)

## The Viral Formula

```
Emotion + Personal Stake + Shareability = Viral
```

### Emotional Triggers
- **Anger**: "FDA delays kill more than the drugs"
- **Fear**: "You'll die of disease, not war"

### Personal Stake
