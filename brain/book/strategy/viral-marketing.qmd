## The Goal: 280 Million Votes

Historical analysis shows: Every peaceful movement that gets **[3.5% active support](../references.qmd#3-5-rule)** succeeds.

- $8 \text{ billion humans} \times 3.5\% = 280 \text{ million}$
- The strategy requires 280 million people to vote YES on the [1% Treaty](../appendix/1-percent-treaty.qmd)
- That's achievable. Here's how.

## The Message That Spreads

### What Doesn't Go Viral

- "Please donate to medical research" (boring)
- "Policy proposal for healthcare reform" (sleep-inducing)
- "Consider supporting this initiative" (ignored)

### What Does Go Viral

- "Humanity has [13,000 nukes](../references.qmd#world-warheads) but no cure for your kid's cancer" (rage-inducing)
- "You're spending $340/year on killing people, $8/year on curing them" (shocking)
- "`{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` investment returns while saving humanity" (greed + altruism)

## The Viral Formula

$$
\text{Emotion} + \text{Personal Stake} + \text{Shareability} = \text{Viral}
$$

### Emotional Triggers
- **Anger**: "[FDA delays kill more than the drugs](../references.qmd#fda-drug-lag-deaths-estimate)"
- **Fear**: "You'll die of disease, not war"
- **Hope**: "You could cure this in 10 years"
- **Greed**: "40-`{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` annual returns forever"

### Personal Stake

- "Your tax dollars: $340 to war, $8 to cures"
- "Your mom dies while bureaucrats meet"
- "Your kid's rare disease: $0 funding"

### Shareability

- One-sentence summary
- Shocking statistic
- Clear call to action
