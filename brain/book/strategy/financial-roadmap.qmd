*How to Bootstrap from $0 to $1 Billion Without Getting Arrested*

You want to end war and disease. You need $1 billion. You have $0.

Here's the 36-month roadmap from a basement to the bond market.

### The Key Insight: You're Not Building the Factory

First, understand what you're actually building. You are **not** building the vast, complex infrastructure for running clinical trials, managing supply chains, or integrating with hospital EHRs. Dozens of companies like Science37 and TrialSpark already do that, and they do it well.

You are building the one thing they can't: **the funding and governance mechanism.**

Your job is to build the political and financial engine that redirects $27 billion a year into a system that subsidizes patients. This creates a massive new market that all the existing trial platforms will compete to serve. You're building the oil well, not the refinery.

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Months 1-3)
*The Only Thing That Matters*

This entire phase is designed to answer one question: Can you make people care enough to click a button? If you can't, the idea is dead.

-   **Month 1: Build the Wishocracy Voting Widget ($15k)**
    -   **What:** A dead-simple web app. It shows two spending options (e.g., "Cancer Research" vs. "Heart Disease") with a slider. Users drag the slider to allocate a hypothetical budget.
    -   **Why:** This tests your core assumption. If you can't get people to engage with a simple voting tool, you'll never get them to sign a referendum or lobby a politician.

-   **Month 2: Raise a $500k Angel Round**
    -   **The Pitch:** "We're not building trial infrastructure—Oxford already proved that works. We're building the financial bribe. This $1 billion bond offering is a political arbitrage play to redirect a $27 billion/year government revenue stream. Your $500k buys a share of all future inflows. When we succeed, existing trial platforms get flooded with subsidized patients. Everyone wins except Raytheon."
    -   **Why:** This proves that sophisticated investors understand the financial leverage and political arbitrage at play.

-   **Month 3: Launch the Referendum Platform V1**
    -   **What:** A minimal viable product with a 30-second signup. It asks a single question: "Should nations redirect 1% of military spending to medical research?"
    -   **Goal:** Get 10,000 verified votes in 30 days at a cost of less than $5 per vote. If you hit this, you've proven you can acquire political support at a scalable cost. If you don't, the idea is dead.

### Phase 2: Scale & Lobby (Months 4-18)
*Building the War Machine*

With a proven concept, you now build the machine to execute the political takeover.

-   **Raise a $10M Series A:** Use the traction from Phase 1 (10,000+ votes, angel funding) to raise the capital needed to hire a core team of world-class engineers, lobbyists, and marketers.
-   **Achieve Viral Growth:** Scale the referendum platform from thousands to millions of users. Implement referral programs and influencer campaigns to drive the cost-per-vote down and the user base up.
-   **Build the Lobbying Machine:** Hire the best (and most expensive) lobbyists in Washington D.C., Brussels, and Beijing. Use the growing referendum numbers as your primary weapon to get the 1% Treaty on the political map.

---

### Phase 3: Bond Offering & Treaty Push (Months 19-36)
*The Final Boss Battle*

This is the all-in moment. You have the team, the traction, and the political access. Now you need the war chest to win.

-   **Raise $1B via VICTORY Bonds:** With a proven model and millions of referendum voters, you launch the full bond offering to the public. This is the $1 billion war chest needed to overpower the defense lobby.
-   **Global Media Blitz:** Use a significant portion of the bond proceeds to launch a relentless, worldwide media campaign. The goal is to make the 1% Treaty the number one political issue in every key country.
-   **Treaty Ratification:** With overwhelming public support and a well-funded lobbying machine, execute the final, coordinated political push in key nations to get the treaty signed and ratified.
