# Fundraising Strategy: The $2.5B Activation Energy

<!-- BEGIN CONTENT MERGED FROM economics/fundraising/fundraising-plan.md -->

## Executive Summary

The capital required for the 1% Treaty is not for ongoing operations—it is a one-time "activation energy" to overcome political inertia and unlock **$27+ billion annually** for global health.

**Total Requirement:** $1.2B - $2.5B over 36 months

## Multi-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Seed Round ($250M - $400M)

- Build referendum platform and legal frameworks
- Prove model in pilot countries
- **Milestone:** 50M verified participants OR pro-treaty majority in G20 nation

### Phase 2: Series A ($500M - $1B)

- Scale to all G7 nations
- Achieve 3.5% global participation (280M people)
- **Milestone:** 3.5% threshold OR first G7 treaty commitment

### Phase 3: Growth Round ($500M - $1.1B)

- Secure ratification in major powers (US, EU, China)
- Capitalize DIH treasury for first year
- **Milestone:** First $1B disbursement

## Key Innovation: Pay-for-Success Model

All major expenditures are structured with performance incentives:

- **Legal fees:** Success fees paid in VICTORY bonds upon ratification
- **Political campaigns:** Competitive prize ecosystem for first ratifications
- **Tech development:** Bonuses tied to platform performance
- **Team compensation:** Equity-heavy, mission-aligned incentives

## Hybrid Communication Strategy: Simple Targets, Sophisticated Mechanics

### The Marketing Message (The "Hook")

For marketing and high-level communications, we lead with a simple, audacious target:

> **"We are targeting returns superior to the world's most elite hedge funds (~40% annualized), which projects to a ~28x return over 10 years. Our financial model is governed by a simple principle: investor payouts never exceed 50% of our income, guaranteeing our mission is always protected."**

### The Backend Engine (Market-Driven Pricing)

For sophisticated investors, we use efficient market mechanisms:
- **Dutch Auctions** for public funding tranches
- Market-based price discovery for optimal capital efficiency
- Smart contract escrows with automated refunds

## De-Risking with Assurance Contracts

The primary risk elimination mechanism:

- **Smart Contract Escrow:** All funds locked until funding goals met
- **Automatic Refunds:** If targets missed, money returns automatically
- **No Collective Action Problem:** "Money-back guarantee" eliminates investment risk
- **Dominant Assurance Contract:** Bonus rewards if goals achieved

## Whale & Billionaire Targeting Strategy

### Why Target Whales

**Speed vs. Scale Trade-off:**
- 1 meeting → $50M check vs. 50,000 meetings → $50M in small checks
- 6-12 months vs. 18+ months timeline
- Lower legal complexity with fewer investors

**Unit Economics Advantage:**
- Higher success probability with mission-aligned billionaires
- Larger check sizes ($10-100M vs. $1-10K)

## Target Categories & Prospects

### Category 1: Crypto Whales & Protocol Treasuries ($500M-1B potential)

**Individual Crypto Billionaires:**
- Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum) - Mission-aligned, understands governance
- Brian Armstrong (Coinbase) - Health tech investor
- Changpeng Zhao (Binance) - Global reach, massive liquidity

**Protocol Treasuries (DAO-to-DAO):**
- Uniswap Labs ($4B+ treasury) - Understands DAO governance
- MakerDAO ($8B+ treasury) - Health-aligned investing
- Compound Treasury - DeFi protocol experience

### Category 2: Health & Pharma Billionaires ($750M-1.5B potential)

**Pharma Executives:**
- Albert Bourla (Pfizer CEO) - Would get 2-5X more R&D funding
- Pascal Soriot (AstraZeneca CEO) - Global operations
- Emma Walmsley (GSK) - Vaccine/global health focus

**Health Tech Billionaires:**
- Patrick Soon-Shiong (NantHealth, $7B) - Cancer research focus
- Anne Wojcicki (23andMe) - Genomics, patient data

### Category 3: Mission-Aligned Mega-Foundations ($500M-1B potential)

**Health-Focused Foundations:**

**Effective Altruism & Longevity:**

- Schmidt Futures (Eric Schmidt) - Technology + health

## Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Crypto Whales (Governance Angle)

**Subject:** Invitation to govern $27B health treasury (Bitcoin-level impact)

"We're building the world's largest decentralized health treasury ($27B annually) using proven DAO models from MakerDAO/Uniswap. Early VICTORY bond holders will govern allocation of this treasury across global health research.

This isn't just an investment - it's a chance to direct more capital than the NIH budget toward curing diseases through 80X more efficient decentralized trials."

### Template 2: Health Billionaires (Industry Advantage)

**Subject:** 2-5X your R&D budget (backed by government treaties)

"We're redirecting 1% of global military spending ($27B annually) into health research using Oxford RECOVERY trial methods (80X lower cost). Early investors get governance control over allocation.

For [Company], this means 2-5X more R&D funding for the same work you're already doing, plus governance votes on priority areas."

### Template 3: Foundations (Mission Multiplication)

**Subject:** 10X your health impact without additional donations

"Your $50M investment would give [Foundation] voting control over $2.7B annually - 54X leverage on your committed capital, in perpetuity.

This uses the same proven model that created $7T in fossil fuel subsidies, but directed toward saving lives."

## Risk Mitigation

### Regulatory Risk

- Structure as utility tokens, not investment contracts

### Market Risk
- Focus on mission-aligned investors, not pure profit seekers
- Create vesting schedules to prevent quick flips
- Build in treasury protections against volatility

### Execution Risk
- Over-recruit targets (100 targets for 20 closes)
- Multiple legal structures for different preferences
- Clear milestones with investor updates

## The Economic Reality

This isn't traditional fundraising—it's political arbitrage. We're adopting the defense industry's massively profitable playbook: turn [$14 million in lobbying into $70.8 billion in contracts](../references.md#military-lobbying-returns).

Our twist: we're offering them an even better deal to fund cures instead of wars.

The math is simple:
- **Investment:** $1.2-2.5B once
- **Return:** $27B+ annually in perpetuity
- **ROI:** 10-20x political arbitrage + 463x economic arbitrage via dFDA

This phased approach ensures capital efficiency while maximizing probability of success through aligned incentives and competitive dynamics.
