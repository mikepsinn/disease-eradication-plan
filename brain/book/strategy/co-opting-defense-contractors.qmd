Defense lobbyists spend [~$100M/year](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#lobbying-100m) and generate $181B in government contracts. That's a [1,810:1 ROI](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc).

They will **absolutely** kill any treaty that threatens their revenue. Not because they're evil. Because that's their job.

## The Obvious Solution

**Pay them more to lobby FOR the treaty instead of against it.**

## The Offer

Allocate strategic partnerships funding from [VICTORY bonds](../../../dih-economic-models/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) to:

1. **Lobbyists directly**: "Here are bonds paying 271.8% annually. Lobby FOR the treaty."
2. **Defense contractor executives**: "Here are bonds worth more than your salary. Stop blocking the treaty."
3. **Private investors/family offices**: "Here are bonds paying 271.8% vs current [10% market return](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#investment-return-comparison)."
4. **Key board members**: Early access to bonds as "strategic advisors"

## The Math They See

**Current deal (lobbying against treaty)**:

- Pay: $500K-2M annually
- Job security: Depends on military budget
- Upside: Salary, maybe some stock options

**Your deal (lobbying for treaty)**:

- Pay: $5-20M in VICTORY bonds
- Returns: 271.8% annually, perpetual
- Job security: Still have 99% of military budget to protect
- Upside: Generational wealth

Even a lobbyist can do that math.

## Why They Take It

### 1. **It's More Money**

271.8% returns > whatever they're currently making.

### 2. **Treaty Doesn't Hurt Them Anyway**

- Military budget only drops 1% ($27.2B of [$2.7T](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending))
- They still have 99% to lobby for
- New contracts still get signed
- Jobs don't disappear

### 3. **Better Returns**

Private investors and family offices seek high returns. VICTORY bonds paying 271.8% vs stock market's 10% represent a compelling opportunity for those willing to take calculated risks on policy-driven investments.

### 4. **Political Cover**

"We're supporting life-saving medical research" plays better than "We're blocking cancer cures to protect profit margins."

## The Strategy in Practice

### Phase 1: Identify Key Players

- Top 50 defense lobbyists (by spending/influence)
- 20 defense contractor CEOs/board members
- 10 major private investors/family offices
- 5 former Pentagon officials with influence

### Phase 2: The Approach

Private meetings. Simple pitch:

> "The 1% treaty is happening. You can fight it and lose, or support it and get rich. Here are VICTORY bonds. They pay 271.8% annually. Forever. Your clients keep 99% of their budgets. Everyone wins. What's your price?"

### Phase 3: The Flip

Once 10-20 key people flip, the rest follow. Nobody wants to be the last holdout fighting a treaty that's obviously passing.

### Phase 4: Active Support

Now they're not just neutral, they're actively lobbying FOR the treaty:

- Testifying to Congress: "This strengthens national security through health"
- Op-eds: "Military readiness requires healthy population"
- Behind-the-scenes: Convincing other lobbyists to flip

## Budget Allocation

A significant portion of the campaign's $1.0B war chest is allocated for strategic partnerships to co-opt key industry players and defense lobbyists. For the full breakdown, see the [Campaign Budget](../../../dih-economic-models/economics/campaign-budget.qmd).

## Why This Works

### It's Literally Their Playbook

Defense contractors spend $100M on lobbying and get $181B back (1,810:1 ROI). The approach uses the EXACT same strategy, just offering better returns.

### It's Legal

- VICTORY bonds are legitimate investment vehicles
- Lobbying for policy change is protected speech
- "Consulting fees" are standard practice

### It's Inevitable

Once credible funding and serious intent are demonstrated, smart players will flip early to get better terms. The rest follow or get left behind.

## What You're NOT Doing

**NOT** asking them to:

- Close factories
- Lay off workers
- Stop making weapons
- "Convert" to medical equipment manufacturing
- Change their business model
- Feel bad about what they do

**Just asking them to**:

- Accept higher returns
- Stop blocking the treaty
- Maybe even support it publicly

## Irony

The strategy uses the corruption to end the corruption.

The same greed that created the military-industrial complex can be redirected to fund medical research. No need to change human nature. Just change what pays better.

## What They Tell Their Boards

**Defense Contractor CEO**: "We invested in these bonds paying 271.8% returns. Treaty passes, we make billions. Treaty fails, our diversification protects us. Either way, we keep 99% of our contracts."

**Private Investor**: "These bonds offer 271.8% returns vs market's 10%. If the treaty passes, we make billions. Worth the calculated risk."

**Lobbyist**: "My client diversified into medical research investment. Supporting the treaty aligns with their new portfolio. Also, it's passing anyway, so why die on this hill?"

## Expected Results

### Early Phase (Months 1-12)

- 5-10 key lobbyists flip
- 2-3 major private investors commit
- Treaty goes from "impossible" to "controversial"

### Mid Phase (Months 13-24)

- 20-30 lobbyists actively supporting
- Defense contractor trade associations go neutral
- Treaty becomes "bipartisan opportunity"

### Late Phase (Months 25-36)

- Former opponents now claiming credit
- "I always supported medical research"
- Treaty passes with strong majority

## Strategy

You can't fight the military-industrial complex.

But you can hire it.

**Cost**: A strategic allocation from the campaign's primary war chest (see [Campaign Budget](../../../dih-economic-models/economics/campaign-budget.qmd))

**Result**: The most powerful lobbying machine in history working FOR the treaty instead of against it

**ROI**: Priceless
