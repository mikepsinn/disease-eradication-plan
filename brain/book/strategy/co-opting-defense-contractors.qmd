# Co-Opting the Defense Lobby: Just Pay Them More

## The Problem

Defense lobbyists spend ~$100M/year and generate $181B in government contracts. That's a 1,813:1 ROI.

They will **absolutely** kill any treaty that threatens their revenue. Not because they're evil. Because that's their job.

## The Obvious Solution

**Pay them more to lobby FOR the treaty instead of against it.**

## The Offer

Allocate $50-200M in VICTORY bonds to:

1. **Lobbyists directly**: "Here are bonds paying 270% annually. Lobby FOR the treaty."
2. **Defense contractor executives**: "Here are bonds worth more than your salary. Stop blocking the treaty."
3. **Pension funds**: "Here are bonds paying 270% vs your current 8% return. Your fiduciary duty requires accepting."
4. **Key board members**: Early access to bonds as "strategic advisors"

## The Math They See

**Current deal (lobbying against treaty)**:
- Pay: $500K-2M annually
- Job security: Depends on military budget
- Upside: Salary, maybe some stock options

**Our deal (lobbying for treaty)**:
- Pay: $5-20M in VICTORY bonds
- Returns: 270% annually, perpetual
- Job security: Still have 99% of military budget to protect
- Upside: Generational wealth

Even a lobbyist can do that math.

## Why They Take It

### 1. **It's More Money**
270% returns > whatever they're currently making.

### 2. **Treaty Doesn't Hurt Them Anyway**
- Military budget only drops 1% ($27B of $2.7T)
- They still have 99% to lobby for
- New contracts still get signed
- Jobs don't disappear

### 3. **Fiduciary Duty (Pension Funds)**
Defense contractor pension funds manage $150B+ and need safe returns. VICTORY bonds paying 270% vs stock market's 10% is a no-brainer. Their fiduciary duty REQUIRES accepting the better investment.

### 4. **Political Cover**
"We're supporting life-saving medical research" plays better than "We're blocking cancer cures to protect profit margins."

## The Strategy in Practice

### Phase 1: Identify Key Players
- Top 50 defense lobbyists (by spending/influence)
- 20 defense contractor CEOs/board members
- 10 major pension fund managers
- 5 former Pentagon officials with influence

### Phase 2: The Approach
Private meetings. Simple pitch:

> "The 1% treaty is happening. You can fight it and lose, or support it and get rich. Here are VICTORY bonds. They pay 270% annually. Forever. Your clients keep 99% of their budgets. Everyone wins. What's your price?"

### Phase 3: The Flip
Once 10-20 key people flip, the rest follow. Nobody wants to be the last holdout fighting a treaty that's obviously passing.

### Phase 4: Active Support
Now they're not just neutral—they're actively lobbying FOR the treaty:
- Testifying to Congress: "This strengthens national security through health"
- Op-eds: "Military readiness requires healthy population"
- Behind-the-scenes: Convincing other lobbyists to flip

## Budget Allocation

**$50-200M in VICTORY bonds, allocated as:**

- **$20-80M**: Direct payments to top 50 lobbyists
- **$15-60M**: Early-access bonds to defense contractor executives
- **$10-40M**: Pension fund allocations (large buys)
- **$5-20M**: "Consulting fees" to former Pentagon officials

## Why This Works

### It's Literally Their Playbook
Defense contractors spend $100M on lobbying and get $181B back (1,813:1 ROI). The approach uses the EXACT same strategy, just offering better returns.

### It's Legal
- VICTORY bonds are legitimate investment vehicles
- Lobbying for policy change is protected speech
- Pension funds legally must pursue best returns
- "Consulting fees" are standard practice

### It's Inevitable
Once credible funding and serious intent are demonstrated, smart players will flip early to get better terms. The rest follow or get left behind.

## What We're NOT Doing

**NOT** asking them to:
- Close factories
- Lay off workers
- Stop making weapons
- "Convert" to medical equipment manufacturing
- Change their business model
- Feel bad about what they do

**Just asking them to**:
- Accept higher returns
- Stop blocking the treaty
- Maybe even support it publicly

## Irony

The strategy uses the corruption to end the corruption.

The same greed that created the military-industrial complex can be redirected to fund medical research. No need to change human nature. Just change what pays better.

## What They Tell Their Boards

**Defense Contractor CEO**: "We invested in these bonds paying 270% returns. Treaty passes, we make billions. Treaty fails, our diversification protects us. Either way, we keep 99% of our contracts."

**Pension Fund Manager**: "Our fiduciary duty requires pursuing the highest risk-adjusted returns. These bonds offer 270% vs market's 10%. We'd be sued for NOT taking them."

**Lobbyist**: "My client diversified into medical research investment. Supporting the treaty aligns with their new portfolio. Also, it's passing anyway, so why die on this hill?"

## Expected Results

### Early Phase (Months 1-12)
- 5-10 key lobbyists flip
- 2-3 major pension funds commit
- Treaty goes from "impossible" to "controversial"

### Mid Phase (Months 13-24)
- 20-30 lobbyists actively supporting
- Defense contractor trade associations go neutral
- Treaty becomes "bipartisan opportunity"

### Late Phase (Months 25-36)
- Former opponents now claiming credit
- "I always supported medical research"
- Treaty passes with strong majority

## The Bottom Line

You can't fight the military-industrial complex.

But you can hire it.

**Cost**: $50-200M in VICTORY bonds

**Result**: The most powerful lobbying machine in history working FOR the treaty instead of against it

**ROI**: Priceless
