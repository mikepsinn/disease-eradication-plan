## The 3.5% Rule

[Research by Erica Chenoweth analyzed 323 violent and nonviolent campaigns from 1900-2006.

**Finding**: No movement that achieved 3.5% active participation failed.](../references.qmd#3-5-rule)

- [8 billion people](../references.qmd#global-population-8-billion) × 3.5% = **280 million**
- That's our target
- That's achievable

## Who Joins First

### The Natural Constituencies

**Patients with Rare Diseases** [(300M globally)](../references.qmd#rare-disease-patients-300m-globally):
- Their diseases have no funding
- They have everything to gain
- Highly motivated
- Natural advocates

**Parents of Sick Children** [(50M+)](../references.qmd#parents-of-sick-children-50m):
- Will do anything to save their kids
- Emotional intensity drives action
- Social networks amplify message

**Healthcare Workers** [(60M globally)](../references.qmd#healthcare-workers-60m-globally):
- See the system's failures daily
- Frustrated by bureaucracy
- Want to actually cure people

**Science/Tech Community** [(US: 37M; global estimates vary)](../references.qmd#science-tech-community-100m):
- Understand decentralization
- Hate inefficiency
- See the solution clearly

**Investment Community** [(Potential investors)](../references.qmd#investment-community-50m):
- 40-270% returns is compelling
- Understand the economics
- Have capital to deploy

### Combined: 560M potential early adopters
**(We only need 280M)**

## The Organizational Structure

### No Traditional Hierarchy

**Traditional movement**:
- Central leadership
- Chapters
- Membership dues
- Slow decision-making

**Our movement**:
- Decentralized (fits the message)
- Self-organizing cells
- No dues ([VICTORY bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) fund it)
- Rapid adaptation

### The Cell Model

Each **cell** is 5-50 people who:
- Share the message locally
- Organize their own actions
- Report to no one
- Coordinate via shared platform

**Why this works**:
- Can't be shut down (no central authority)
- Scales infinitely
- Adapts to local conditions
- Unstoppable

## The Recruitment Funnel

### Stage 1: Awareness (1 billion people)
- See the message via social media
- "We spend 40X more on killing than curing"
- 30-second exposure

### Stage 2: Interest (500 million)
- Click through, read more
- Understand the 1% Treaty
- See the personal benefit

### Stage 3: Commitment (280 million)
- Vote YES on treaty
- Buy VICTORY bonds
- Recruit others

### Conversion Rate
- Awareness → Interest: 50%
- Interest → Commitment: 56%
- **Result**: 280M committed from 1B aware

## The Local Strategies

### City-Level Organizing

**Step 1**: Find local cell leader
- Rare disease patient
- Doctor
- Parent of sick child

**Step 2**: First meeting
- Show the data
- Explain the treaty
- Demonstrate bonds

**Step 3**: Growth
- Each member recruits 3 others
- Cell splits at 50 people
- New cells form

### University Campus Strategy

**Target**: [264M students globally](../references.qmd#global-university-student-population-20m)

**Approach**:
- "Want to save the world AND get rich?"
- Student investment clubs
- Pre-med students (future doctors)
- Economics students (understand the model)

**Goal**: 5% adoption = 13.2M student activists

### Workplace Strategy

**Target**: Fortune 500 employees

**Approach**:
- Employer-sponsored bond programs
- "Invest 1% of salary, company matches"
- Healthcare cost savings pitch to executives
- ESG compliance angle

**Goal**: 10M corporate participants

### Religious Community Strategy

**All religions agree**: Healing the sick is good

**Approach**:
- "Your faith says heal the sick - here's how"
- Interfaith coalition for treaty
- Moral argument transcends politics

**Goal**: 50M faith-based supporters

## The Toolkit for Activists

### Digital Tools
- **Voter registration**: One-click YES vote
- **Bond purchase**: Integrated platform
- **Share counter**: Gamified recruitment
- **Impact tracker**: "Your network saved X lives"

### Physical Tools
- **Flyers**: One-page treaty explainer

- **Moral**: "Save millions of lives"
- **Political**: "Both parties benefit"

## The Coalition Building

### Strange Bedfellows Strategy

- Corporate greed argument
- Peace dividend

**Right agrees because**:
- Market-based solution
- Returns on investment
- Decentralization

**Result**: Unstoppable coalition

### The Stakeholder Map

**Patients**: Want cures
**Doctors**: Want to cure
**Pharma**: Want profit (we give them that)
**Insurance**: Want lower costs
**Government**: Want happy voters
**Investors**: Want returns

**Everyone wins = Everyone supports**

## The Resistance Points (and Responses)

### "This is too radical"
**Response**: "Dying is radical. This is practical."

### "It will never pass"
**Response**: "Not with that attitude. Vote YES anyway."

### "I don't trust it"
**Response**: "You don't have to. Smart contracts are trustless."

### "What if it fails?"
**Response**: "Then we tried. What if we don't try and your kid dies?"

## The Success Metrics

### Early Phase (Month 1-3)

- Media mentions: 100

### Growth Phase (Month 4-6)
- Cells formed: 10,000

## The Amplification Strategy

### Every Voice Multiplies

**Individual** shares with 10 people → 10 aware
**Those 10** share with 10 each → 100 aware
**Those 100** share with 10 each → 1,000 aware

**6 degrees of separation**:
- You share with 10
- 6 iterations = 1 million reached
- **Everyone reach 10 = whole world reached**

## The Momentum Builders

### Public Events
- **Town halls**: Local organizing
- **Rallies**: Show of force
- **Marches**: Media coverage
- **Flash mobs**: Viral moments

### Media Events
- **Debates**: "Should we cure disease?"
- **Interviews**: Patients telling stories
- **Documentaries**: Full explanation
- **News coverage**: Mainstream reach

### Symbolic Actions
- **Petition deliveries**: 10M signatures
- **Bond milestone celebrations**: "$1B invested!"
- **First treaty signing**: Historic moment
- **First disease cured**: Victory lap

## The International Coordination

### Regional Strategies

**US/Europe** (Wealthy):
- Economic argument
- Investment returns
- Quality of life

**Asia** (Growing):
- Development opportunity
- Health security
- Regional leadership

**Africa/South America** (Developing):
- Direct benefit
- Disease burden reduction

### Language Adaptation
- Core message stays same
- Cultural framing adjusts
- Local examples used

## The Bottom Line

We don't need everyone.
We don't even need most people.

**We need 3.5% to actively participate.**

That's 280 million people who:
- Vote YES
- Buy bonds
- Share the message

**That's achievable. That's happening. That's victory.**
