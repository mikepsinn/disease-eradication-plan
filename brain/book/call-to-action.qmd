Here's how to contribute:

---

### For Everyone: Join the 3.5%

The single most important action: join the **[Global Referendum](./strategy.qmd)**.
The first objective is to mobilize [3.5% of the world's population](../references.qmd#3-5-rule) to create an undeniable mandate for change.

- **Vote "Yes":** Vote on the 1% Treaty and make your voice heard.
- **Share the Mission:** Use your network to spread the word.
  Every person recruited brings the movement closer to the tipping point.

### For Investors & Donors: Fund the Victory

The mission requires a new financial engine.
Here's how to capitalize it:

- **Accredited Investors:** For pre-seed or seed rounds to fund the activation team, **[contact us](mailto:hello@dih.earth)**.
- **Public Investors:** Once launched, purchase **[VICTORY Bonds](./economics.qmd)** to invest directly in the war on disease and earn financial returns based on the success of the 1% Treaty.
- **Philanthropists:** Foundation or major donor support can provide the critical first-loss capital to de-risk the project for other investors and accelerate the timeline.

---

### For Leaders of Non-Profits, NGOs, and Advocacy Organizations

Organizations can play a pivotal role in building the coalition.
The case for involvement is not based on altruism, but on arithmetic.

- **The Challenge: Run the Numbers.**
  Run a rigorous cost-effectiveness analysis comparing the impact of current programs to the impact of redirecting a portion of advocacy budgets to helping pass the 1% Treaty.
  The data shows that for almost any major global problem—health, poverty, climate, or human rights—helping to unlock the [$16.5 trillion peace dividend](../references.qmd#global-violence-costs) is the single biggest action possible to achieve organizational missions.
  When ready to join the coalition, **[contact us](mailto:hello@dih.earth)**.

### For Builders & Technologists: Enlist Your Skills

The team will build the infrastructure for this global movement.

- **Team:** Key leadership roles in engineering, finance, growth, and political strategy are available.
  See the **[hiring plan](/brain/book/reference/operations-roadmap.qmd)** for more details.
- **Contribute to Open Source:** The [dFDA protocol](../solution/dfda.qmd) and the global referendum engine will be open-source projects.
  Bounties will be posted for specific features and security audits.

This is a call to arms for the world's most talented and driven individuals.
