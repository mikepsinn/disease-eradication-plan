In 1906, statistician Francis Galton visited a county fair.

They had a contest: guess the weight of an ox.

- 787 people guessed
- Most had no expertise
- Individual guesses ranged wildly

Galton calculated the median guess: **1,197 pounds**

The ox's actual weight: **1,198 pounds**

**The crowd was off by 1 pound.**
**The best expert was off by 100 pounds.**

## The Pattern Repeats Everywhere

### Stock Markets

- Individual investors: Often wrong
- Market average: Remarkably accurate at pricing
- Expert fund managers: Usually lose to index funds

### Wikipedia

- Individual editors: Sometimes wrong, sometimes biased
- Aggregate knowledge: More accurate than Encyclopedia Britannica
- Expert editors alone: Couldn't scale to cover everything

### Google Search

- Individual websites: Varying quality
- PageRank (crowd wisdom): Finds best results
- Any single expert curator: Can't keep up

## Why Crowds Beat Experts

### 1. Diversity of Information

**Expert Committee** (NIH model):

- 200 people
- Similar education (medical schools)
- Similar experience (academic research)
- Similar biases (publish or perish)
- **Total knowledge**: What 200 similar people know

**Crowd** (dFDA model):

- 8 billion people
- Every disease experience
- Every genetic variation
- Every treatment response
- **Total knowledge**: All human experience

### 2. Error Cancellation

**Expert Committee**:

- All experts might share same blind spot
- No mechanism to correct systematic bias
- Groupthink amplifies errors

**Crowd**:

- Individual errors are random
- Random errors cancel out
- Systematic errors are rare (too diverse to share bias)

### 3. Skin in the Game

**Expert Committee**:

- Makes decisions for others
- No consequence if wrong
- Career safe either way

**Crowd**:

- Decides for themselves
- Direct consequence if wrong
- Strong incentive to be right

## The Math: Why 8 Billion > 200

```python
import numpy as np

# Expert committee
experts = 200
expert_accuracy = 0.70  # 70% right
committee_error = 1 - expert_accuracy  # 30% wrong

# If they have correlated errors (groupthink)
committee_correlation = 0.50
effective_committee_accuracy = expert_accuracy + (1 - expert_accuracy) * (1 - committee_correlation)
# = 0.85 (85% accurate)

# Crowd
crowd_size = 8_000_000_000
individual_accuracy = 0.55  # 55% right (worse than experts individually)
crowd_correlation = 0.01  # Almost no correlation (too diverse)

# Wisdom of crowds effect
crowd_error_rate = (1 - individual_accuracy) / np.sqrt(crowd_size)
crowd_accuracy = 1 - crowd_error_rate
# = 0.9999... (99.99% accurate)

from IPython.display import Markdown, display
display(Markdown(f"""
**Committee accuracy: {effective_committee_accuracy:.1%}**
**Crowd accuracy: {crowd_accuracy:.2%}**
"""))
```

**8 billion mediocre guesses beat 200 expert guesses.**

## When Crowds Fail (And How to Fix It)

### Failure Mode 1: Herding

**Problem**: Everyone copies each other instead of thinking independently

**Example**: Stock market bubbles, fashion trends

**Fix**: Make individual decisions before seeing others' choices (dFDA does this)

### Failure Mode 2: Manipulation

**Problem**: A few powerful actors influence many

**Example**: Propaganda, advertising

**Fix**: Transparent data, auditable results, no gatekeepers

### Failure Mode 3: Homogeneity

**Problem**: Crowd becomes too similar (loses diversity)

**Example**: Echo chambers, filter bubbles

**Fix**: Include all 8 billion humans (maximum diversity)

## How Medical Research Currently Violates Every Principle

### NIH Funding Decisions

**Current**: 200-person committee decides what to research

**Problem**:

- All medical researchers (homogeneous)
- All want more research grants (aligned incentive to continue, not solve)
- No skin in the game (not sick themselves)
- Groupthink (all went to same schools)

**Result**: 50 years, \$2.4 trillion spent, zero diseases eradicated

### FDA Drug Approval

**Current**: ~200 reviewers decide what treatments allowed

**Problem**:

- All bureaucrats (similar risk aversion)
- Career incentive to delay (safe choice)
- No disease experience (not patients)
- Correlated errors (all trained same way)

**Result**: 17 years per drug, millions die waiting

## How dFDA Uses Wisdom of Crowds

### Trial Participation

- 8 billion potential participants (maximum diversity)
- Each decides for themselves (skin in the game)
- Data aggregated across millions (errors cancel)
- No gatekeepers (can't be manipulated)

### Treatment Effectiveness

- Everyone tracks their outcomes
- Algorithm aggregates data
- Individual errors cancel out
- Truth emerges from noise

### Resource Allocation (Wishocracy)

- 8 billion people express preferences
- No single committee decides
- Preferences aggregated via AI
- Result reflects collective wisdom

## The Proof: Decentralized > Centralized

### Centralized (Soviet Agriculture)

- Experts plan everything
- Committee decides what to plant
- **Result**: Millions starve

### Decentralized (Market Agriculture)

- Millions of farmers decide independently
- Prices aggregate information
- **Result**: Food abundance

### Centralized (Encyclopedia Britannica)

- Expert editors curate knowledge
- Slow, expensive, limited
- **Result**: 40,000 articles

### Decentralized (Wikipedia)

- Crowd curates knowledge
- Fast, free, comprehensive
- **Result**: 6 million articles, more accurate

### Centralized (NIH/FDA)

- 200-person committees decide
- Slow, expensive, limited
- **Result**: 95% of diseases have no treatment

### Decentralized (dFDA)

- 8 billion people decide
- Fast, efficient, comprehensive
- **Result**: Every disease gets trials

## Why Experts Hate This

### The Expert's Dilemma

If crowds are smarter than expert committees, **experts lose power**.

**Current system**:

- Experts gatekeep knowledge
- Experts decide what to research
- Experts approve treatments
- Experts justify their \$200K salaries

**dFDA system**:

- Crowd generates knowledge
- Crowd decides what to research (via behavior)
- Algorithm approves (crowd wisdom aggregated)
- Experts... become less important

### The Real Reason They Fight Decentralization

It's not about patient safety (crowds are safer).
It's not about quality (crowds are more accurate).

**It's about power.**

200 people losing control over medicine for 8 billion.

## The Conditions for Crowd Wisdom

Per James Surowiecki's research, crowds are wise when:

1.  **Diversity**: Wide range of opinions and information
2.  **Independence**: People decide without group pressure
3.  **Decentralization**: Decisions made by individuals
4.  **Aggregation**: Method to combine individual inputs

### Does NIH/FDA Have These?

1.  Diversity: ❌ (All medical researchers, all bureaucrats)
2.  Independence: ❌ (Groupthink, career pressure)
3.  Decentralization: ❌ (Committee decides for everyone)
4.  Aggregation: ❌ (No aggregation, committee vote)

### Does dFDA Have These?

1.  Diversity: ✅ (8 billion humans, all diseases, all genetics)
2.  Independence: ✅ (Each person decides for themselves)
3.  Decentralization: ✅ (Millions of parallel trials)
4.  Aggregation: ✅ (AI combines all data)

## The Uncomfortable Truth

The world's leading medical experts, working together in committees, **are dumber than random people deciding independently**.

This isn't an insult.
**It's mathematics.**

- 200 correlated guesses < 8 billion uncorrelated guesses
- Experts have blind spots; crowds don't
- Committees have groupthink; markets don't

## Real-World Proof: COVID-19

### Expert Committees Said:

- Masks don't work (Feb 2020)
- Actually masks do work (April 2020)
- Lockdowns for 2 weeks
- Actually lockdowns for 2 years
- Vaccines stop transmission
- Actually vaccines reduce symptoms

### Crowd Wisdom Said:

- Some things work, some don't
- Try everything, measure everything
- Learn from data, not theory

### Who Got It Right Faster?
**Oxford RECOVERY trial** (crowdsourced data):

- Tested 7 treatments in 6 months
- Saved 1 million lives
- Cost: \$10 million

**NIH/FDA** (expert committees):

- Blocked early treatment trials
- Delayed approvals
- Saved: Far fewer lives
- Cost: \$1.6 billion

### Bonus: Prediction Markets vs Experts

**Iowa Electronic Markets** (crowd betting on elections):
- More accurate than polls 74% of the time
- Beat expert pundits 451 out of 596 races

**Expert Political Analysts**:
- Wrong about Brexit
- Wrong about 2016 US election
- Wrong about most "sure things"
