In 1906, statistician Francis Galton visited a county fair.

They had a contest: guess the weight of an ox.

- 787 drunk farmers guessed
- Most couldn't spell "ox"
- One guy thought it was a large dog
- Another insisted it was 50,000 pounds

Galton calculated the median guess: **1,197 pounds**

The ox's actual weight: **1,198 pounds**

**The drunk farmers were off by 1 pound.**
**The best expert was off by 100 pounds.**


## The Pattern Repeats Everywhere

### Stock Markets

- Individual investors: Often wrong
- Market average: Remarkably accurate at pricing
- Expert fund managers: Usually lose to index funds

### Wikipedia

- Individual editors: Sometimes wrong, sometimes biased
- Aggregate knowledge: More accurate than Encyclopedia Britannica
- Expert editors alone: Couldn't scale to cover everything

### Google Search

- Individual websites: Varying quality
- PageRank (crowd wisdom): Finds best results
- Any single expert curator: Can't keep up

## Why Crowds Beat Experts

### 1. Diversity of Information

**Expert Committee** (NIH model):

- 200 people
- Similar education (medical schools)
- Similar experience (academic research)
- Similar biases (publish or perish)
- **Total knowledge**: What 200 similar people know

**Crowd** (dFDA model):

- 8 billion people
- Every disease experience
- Every genetic variation
- Every treatment response
- **Total knowledge**: All human experience

### 2. Error Cancellation

**Expert Committee**:

- All experts might share same blind spot
- No mechanism to correct systematic bias
- Groupthink amplifies errors

**Crowd**:

- Individual errors are random
- Random errors cancel out
- Systematic errors are rare (too diverse to share bias)

### 3. Skin in the Game

**Expert Committee**:

- Makes decisions for others
- No consequence if wrong
- Career safe either way

**Crowd**:

- Decides for themselves
- Direct consequence if wrong (they die)
- Strong incentive to be right (not dying is popular)
- If they die: They're dead

## The Math: Why 8 Billion > 200

The wisdom of crowds isn't magic - it's statistics. When you aggregate millions of independent observations, individual errors tend to cancel out while truth reinforces itself.

**Think of it this way:**
- 200 experts who all learned the same thing will all be wrong the same way
- 8 billion people with different experiences will be wrong in different ways
- Different errors cancel out; shared truths remain

This is why Wikipedia (written by amateurs) is more accurate than Britannica (written by experts).


## How Medical Research Currently Violates Every Principle

### NIH Funding Decisions

**Current**: 200-person committee decides what to research

**Problem**:

- All medical researchers (homogeneous)
- All want more research grants (aligned incentive to continue, not solve)
- No skin in the game (they're not dying of the diseases they ignore)
- Groupthink (all went to same schools, all think the same thoughts)

**Result**: 50 years, \$2.4 trillion spent, zero diseases eradicated

### FDA Drug Approval

**Current**: ~200 reviewers decide what treatments allowed

**Problem**:

- All bureaucrats (similar risk aversion)
- Career incentive to delay (safe choice)
- No disease experience (not patients)
- Correlated errors (all trained same way)

**Result**: 17 years per drug, millions die waiting

## How dFDA Uses Wisdom of Crowds

### Trial Participation

- 8 billion potential participants (maximum diversity)
- Each decides for themselves (skin in the game)
- Data aggregated across millions (errors cancel)
- No gatekeepers (can't be manipulated)

### Treatment Effectiveness

- Everyone tracks their outcomes
- Algorithm aggregates data
- Individual errors cancel out
- Truth emerges from noise

### Resource Allocation (Wishocracy)

- 8 billion people express preferences
- No single committee decides
- Preferences aggregated via AI
- Result reflects collective wisdom

## The Proof: Decentralized > Centralized

### Centralized (Encyclopedia Britannica)

- Expert editors curate knowledge
- Slow, expensive, limited
- **Result**: 40,000 articles

### Decentralized (Wikipedia)

- Crowd curates knowledge
- Fast, free, comprehensive
- **Result**: 6 million articles, more accurate

### Centralized (NIH/FDA)

- 200-person committees decide
- Slow, expensive, limited
- **Result**: 95% of diseases have no treatment

### Decentralized (dFDA)

- 8 billion people decide
- Fast, efficient, comprehensive
- **Result**: Every disease gets trials

## Why Experts Hate This

### The Expert's Dilemma

If crowds are smarter than expert committees, **experts lose power**.

**Current system**:

- Experts gatekeep knowledge
- Experts decide what to research
- Experts approve treatments
- Experts justify their \$200K salaries

**dFDA system**:

- Crowd generates knowledge
- Crowd decides what to research (via behavior)
- Algorithm approves (crowd wisdom aggregated)
- Experts... become less important

### The Real Reason They Fight Decentralization

It's not about patient safety (crowds are safer).
It's not about quality (crowds are more accurate).

**It's about power.**

200 people losing control over medicine for 8 billion.

Imagine being told that your fancy degree, your prestigious position, your entire career built on being The Expert™ is less valuable than asking random people on the street.

That's not a pill they want to swallow.

(Ironic, since they won't let you swallow pills either without their permission.)


## The Uncomfortable Truth

The world's leading medical experts, working together in committees, **are dumber than random people deciding independently**.

This isn't an insult.
**It's mathematics.**

- 200 correlated guesses < 8 billion uncorrelated guesses
- Experts have blind spots; crowds don't
- Committees have groupthink; markets don't

## Real-World Proof: COVID-19

### Expert Committees Said:

- Masks don't work (Feb 2020)
- Actually masks do work (April 2020)
- Lockdowns for 2 weeks
- Actually lockdowns for 2 years
- Vaccines stop transmission
- Actually vaccines reduce symptoms

### Crowd Wisdom Said:

- Some things work, some don't
- Try everything, measure everything
- Learn from data, not theory

### Who Got It Right Faster?
**Oxford RECOVERY trial** (crowdsourced data):

- Tested 7 treatments in 6 months
- Saved 1 million lives
- Cost: \$10 million

**NIH/FDA** (expert committees):

- Blocked early treatment trials
- Delayed approvals
- Saved: Far fewer lives
- Cost: \$1.6 billion

### Bonus: Prediction Markets vs Experts

**Iowa Electronic Markets** (crowd betting on elections):
- More accurate than polls 74% of the time
- Beat expert pundits 451 out of 596 races

**Expert Political Analysts**:
- Wrong about Brexit
- Wrong about 2016 US election
- Wrong about most "sure things"
