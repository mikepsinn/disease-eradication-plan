## Humanity Fights Two Wars

**War #1: Against Each Other** (War on Humanity)

- Cost: [$2.7 trillion/year](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)
- Deaths: Direct war deaths plus ongoing conflicts
- Duration: All of human history
- Progress: Getting worse
- Designed to: Continue forever

**War #2: Against Disease** (War on Disease)

- Cost: [$68 billion/year](../references.qmd#global-gov-med-research-spending) (medical research)
- Deaths: [55 million/year](../references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)
- Duration: Also all of human history
- Progress: Glacial
- Designed to: Make pharma rich, not cure disease

## The Key Difference

**War on Humanity** is designed to be **profitable but endless**.

**War on Disease** could be designed to **actually win**.

But it isn't.

## Why War on Humanity Never Ends

### The Incentives

- Defense contractors profit from conflict, not peace
- Military budgets increase during war
- Weapons become obsolete, creating demand for new ones
- No one profits from ending war

### The Result

We have:

- [13,000 nuclear weapons](../references.qmd#world-warheads) (can [destroy Earth 20 times](../../reference/nuclear-weapon-cost-and-casualties.md))
- Hypersonic missiles that can't be stopped
- Autonomous weapons (Skynet approaching)
- Space weapons programs
- [$2.7 trillion annual budget](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)

But we still have wars.

**Because the system isn't designed to win. It's designed to continue.**

## Why War on Disease Never Ends (Currently)

### The Same Broken Incentives

- Pharma profits from treatment, not cures
- Chronic disease = recurring revenue
- Cures = one-time payment, then customer lost
- NIH bureaucrats profit from continued research grants
- No one in power profits from ending disease

### The Result

We have:

- 50 years of cancer research, no universal cure
- [$48 billion NIH budget](../references.qmd#nih-budget-fy2025), zero diseases eradicated
- [17 years to approve one drug](../references.qmd#research-to-practice-gap)
- [95% of diseases have no treatment](../references.qmd#95-pct-diseases-no-treatment)
- Your kid dies while bureaucrats meet

**Because this system also isn't designed to win. It's designed to continue.**

## What a War Designed to Win Looks Like

### World War II

- **Start**: 1939
- **End**: 1945
- **Duration**: 6 years
- **Result**: Axis powers completely defeated

### Why It Worked

- Clear victory condition (unconditional surrender)
- Massive resources deployed ([$4 trillion in modern dollars](../references.qmd#wwii-cost-4-trillion-today))
- No profit motive (national survival)
- All unnecessary barriers removed
- Speed prioritized over bureaucracy
- Result: Victory

### Manhattan Project (Part of WWII)

- **Start**: 1942
- **End**: 1945
- **Duration**: 3 years
- **Cost**: $2 billion (1945 dollars) = [$30 billion today](../references.qmd#manhattan-project-cost-30b)
- **Result**: Atomic bomb deployed, war ended

## What War on Disease Designed to Win Would Look Like

### The Oxford RECOVERY Model (But Bigger)

**Duration**: 10 years to cure major diseases
**Cost**: $27 billion/year (1% of military budget)
**Method**: Decentralized trials, anyone can participate
**Victory condition**: Disease eradicated
**Profit motive**: Removed (patients subsidized)
**Barriers**: Removed (no FDA approval, just trial-and-learn)
**Speed**: Results in months, not decades

### The Outcome

| Disease | Current State | After 10 Years |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| Cancer | [10M deaths/year](../references.qmd#cancer-deaths-10m-annually) | Cured |
| Heart Disease | [18M deaths/year](../references.qmd#death-causes-vs-fear) | Prevented |
| Alzheimer's | [2.6M deaths/year](../references.qmd#alzheimers-deaths-2-6m-annually) | Cured |
| Diabetes | [2M deaths/year](../references.qmd#diabetes-deaths-2m-annually) | Cured |
| All others | 22M deaths/year | Drastically reduced |

**Total lives saved over 10 years**: 200-300 million

## Structure It Differently: Markets Not Ministries

Unlike previous "wars on" things, the War on Disease uses markets, not bureaucracies:

**Traditional Government Wars**:

- Create bureaucracy to manage (FDA, DEA, etc.)
- Bureaucracy needs problem to exist (job security)
- Result: Problem continues forever

**War on Disease ([DIH](../solution/dih.qmd) Model)**:

- Build no bureaucracy to preserve (use smart contracts)
- Pay for outcomes, not process
- Create competition between solutions, not monopoly
- Researchers get paid for curing diseases, not getting grants
- Minimize perverse incentives through market competition

**Align the Incentives**:

- Patients: Get subsidized treatments, not exploited
- Researchers: Get rewarded for cures, not papers
- Investors: Earn returns from health, not death
- Politicians: Get elected for results, not promises

## Spillover Victory: Solving Everything Else

Once you can cure diseases, most social problems become solvable:

- **War on Drugs**: Addiction is a disease - actually cure it
- **War on Poverty**: Healthy people aren't poor
- **War on Terror**: Mental health treatment prevents radicalization
- **War on Crime**: Cure antisocial personality disorder

Every social problem has biological roots.
Fix the roots, and the problems disappear.

**The Meta-Victory**:

This becomes the first successful "War on" anything ever.
Template for everything else (education, housing, etc.)
The end of central planning's credibility.
The beginning of the market revolution.

## The Math of Victory

### War on Humanity (Current)

```python
annual_spending = 2_700_000_000_000 # [1]
annual_deaths = 14_000_000 # [2]
victory_condition = None  # No end state
years_to_victory = float('inf')  # Never
```

### War on Disease (Current)

```python
annual_spending = 68_000_000_000 # [3]
annual_deaths = 55_000_000 # [4]
victory_condition = None  # No end state (pharma wants recurring revenue)
years_to_victory = float('inf')  # Never
```

### War on Disease (Redesigned)

```python
annual_spending = 27_000_000_000  # 1% of military
annual_deaths = 55_000_000  # Starting
victory_condition = "Eradicate major diseases"
years_to_victory = 10  # Achievable with Oxford model
deaths_prevented = 200_000_000  # Over 10 years
```

## Why Nobody Fights War on Disease to Win

### Follow the Money

**If cancer is cured**:

- [Oncologists lose $200K/year jobs](../references.qmd#oncologist-median-salary-200k)
- Pharma loses [$100B/year in chemo sales](../references.qmd#war-on-cancer-treatment-cost)
- Hospitals lose entire oncology departments
- Research grants disappear
- NIH budget justifications collapse

**Result**: The people with power to cure cancer **profit from not curing it**.

### The Same Pattern as War

**If war ended**:

- Defense contractors lose [$2.7T/year](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)
- Generals lose justification for budgets
- Politicians lose campaign donations from defense lobby
- Jobs disappear

**Result**: The people with power to end war **profit from continuing it**.

## The First War Designed to Be Won

The [1% Treaty](../appendix/1-percent-treaty.qmd) + DIH + [dFDA](../solution/dfda.qmd) creates the **first War on Disease designed for victory**.

### How It's Different

**Victory condition**: Clearly defined (cure major diseases)
**Incentive**: Cure disease → get paid (not treat disease → get paid)
**Barriers**: Removed (no FDA, decentralized trials)
**Speed**: Months to results (not decades)
**Scale**: [Everyone participates (not just 15%)](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-patient-participation-rate)
**Endpoint**: Diseases eradicated, mission accomplished

### Why It Will Work

- Patients are subsidized, so trials are profitable
- Fast results mean continuous improvement
- No regulatory bottleneck
- No profit from failure (only from cure)
- Clear metrics (deaths prevented)

## The Historical Precedent

We've won wars before when we actually tried:

- **Smallpox**: [Eradicated in 10 years once we committed](../references.qmd#smallpox-eradication-10-year-campaign)
- **Polio**: Nearly eradicated through mass campaigns
- **WWII**: Won in 6 years with full commitment

We can win War on Disease. **We just have to design it to be won.**

## The Choice

### Option A: Continue Both Wars Forever

- Keep spending $11.4T on War on Humanity (never win)
- Keep spending [$68B on War on Disease](../references.qmd#global-gov-med-research-spending) (never win)
- 69 million die annually, forever

### Option B: Win One War, Then the Other

- Redirect 1% of military to War on Disease
- Win War on Disease in 10 years (save 200M lives)
- With diseases cured, redirect savings to end War on Humanity
- Humanity finally wins both wars

## The Bottom Line

The difference between a war that ends and a war that continues forever is **how you design it**.

- Design for profit → War continues
- Design for victory → War ends

We know how to design for victory. We did it with WWII, smallpox, and polio.

Now we do it with disease.

**The 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA: The first War on Disease designed to actually win.**
