## The Body Count of Central Planning

Before we talk about the FDA, let's remember what happens when committees try to manage complex systems:

### Historical Death Toll from Central Planning

| Central Planning Disaster | Deaths | Cause |
|--------------------------|--------|--------|
| Soviet Collectivization (1930-33) | [5.7-8.7 million](../references.qmd#soviet-collectivization-deaths) | Committee decided how to farm |
| Great Leap Forward (1958-62) | [15-45 million](../references.qmd#great-leap-forward-deaths) | Committee decided steel > food |
| Khmer Rouge (1975-79) | [1.5-2 million](../references.qmd#khmer-rouge-deaths) | Committee decided who lives |
| North Korea (ongoing) | [3+ million](../references.qmd#north-korea-famine-deaths) | Committee decides everything |
| **FDA Drug Lag** (1962-present) | **[Hundreds of thousands](../references.qmd#fda-drug-lag-deaths-estimate)** | **Committee decides what medicines you can have** |

The FDA's death toll from drug delays rivals many historical tragedies.

## The FDA: America's Medical Politburo

The Food and Drug Administration is literally a committee of [~200 people](../references.qmd#fda-reviewer-count) who decide:
- What treatments 330 million Americans can access
- Which drugs get tested
- How trials must be conducted
- Who lives and who dies

### The Committee Structure
```
FDA Commissioner
    ↓
Office of Medical Products
    ↓
Center for Drug Evaluation (CDER)
    ↓
Review Divisions (22 committees)
    ↓
Individual Reviewers (~200 people)
    ↓
YOUR DEATH (if they're slow)
```

## The 82X Inefficiency: Oxford vs FDA

Remember the Oxford RECOVERY trial? Let's see how it compares to FDA-regulated trials:

### The Numbers Don't Lie

| Metric | FDA System | Oxford RECOVERY | Difference |
|--------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| Cost per patient | [$41,000](../references.qmd#trial-cost-41k) | [$500](../references.qmd#recovery-cost-500) | **82X cheaper** |
| Time to results | [17 years](../references.qmd#research-to-practice-gap) | 6 months | **34X faster** |
| Patients included | [15% (healthy only)](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-patient-participation-rate) | 100% (dying included) | **6.7X more inclusive** |
| Paperwork required | [Complex multi-form protocols](../references.qmd#fda-vs-oxford-paperwork) | [3 one-page forms](../references.qmd#fda-vs-oxford-paperwork) | **Dramatically simpler** |
| Lives saved | 0 | [1,000,000+](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-summary-quote) | **∞X more effective** |

## Why Committees Always Fail at Complex Tasks

### The Knowledge Problem (Hayek Was Right)

[Friedrich Hayek won a Nobel Prize](../references.qmd#hayek-nobel-prize) for explaining why central planning fails:

1. **Information is distributed** - No committee can know what [8 billion people](../references.qmd#global-population-8-billion) know
2. **Knowledge is tacit** - Much knowledge can't be communicated to committees
3. **Circumstances change constantly** - Committees are always behind
4. **Incentives are misaligned** - Committee members optimize for not getting fired

### Applied to Medicine

The FDA committee doesn't know:
- What disease you have
- How your body responds to treatments
- What risks you're willing to take
- Whether you'd rather die trying or die waiting

But they decide for you anyway.

## The FDA's Greatest Hits (Deaths)

### 1. Beta Blockers: 100,000+ Dead
- Europe approved: 1965
- FDA approved: 1976
- 11-year delay
- Deaths during delay: [~100,000 heart patients](../references.qmd#beta-blocker-drug-lag-deaths)

### 2. Interleukin-2: Thousands Dead
- Initial efficacy shown: 1985
- FDA approved: 1992
- 7-year delay from demonstrated efficacy
- Disease affecting [~10,000 annually](../references.qmd#interleukin-2-drug-lag-deaths)
- Kidney cancer patients who died during delay: [thousands over 7-year period](../references.qmd#interleukin-2-drug-lag-deaths)

### 3. Drug Lag in General: Hundreds of Thousands Dead
- Average FDA approval: [10-15 years](../references.qmd#fda-approval-timeline-10-years)
- Average European approval: [5-7 years](../references.qmd#european-drug-approval-timeline)
- [Excess American deaths from delay: Hundreds of thousands since 1962](../references.qmd#fda-drug-lag-deaths-estimate) (21,000-120,000 per decade)

## The Mechanism of Murder: How FDA Kills

### Step 1: Require Impossibly Expensive Trials
```python
fda_trial_cost = 2_600_000_000  # $2.6 billion
diseases_in_world = 10_000
profitable_diseases = diseases_in_world * 0.05  # Only 5% can recoup $2.6B
untreated_diseases = diseases_in_world * 0.95  # 95% never get trials

print(f"Diseases that get treatments: {profitable_diseases}")
print(f"Diseases where you just die: {untreated_diseases}")
```

The calculation above is based on the [$2.6 billion](../references.qmd#post-1962-drug-costs-explode) cost to bring a new drug to market, the estimated [10,000 diseases](../references.qmd#number-of-known-diseases) known to humanity, and the fact that [95% of them never get trials](../references.qmd#95-pct-diseases-no-treatment) because they aren't profitable enough to pursue.

### Step 2: Exclude Sick People
FDA trials typically exclude:
- People over 65 (the ones who need medicine most)
- People with multiple conditions (most sick people)
- People on other medications (everyone sick)
- Pregnant women (entire gender for 9 months)
- Children ([25% of population](../references.qmd#child-population-percentage))

**Result**: Trials test drugs on healthy people, approve them, then sick people take them and die.

### Step 3: Hide Negative Results
- [50% of all trials never publish results](../references.qmd#publication-bias-clinical-trials)
- Negative results buried
- Only positive trials see daylight
- Doctors prescribe based on incomplete data
- Patients die from "approved" drugs that don't work

## Central Planning vs Markets: The Eternal Battle

### Central Planning (FDA/NIH Model)
- **Decision makers**: 200 bureaucrats
- **Information used**: What reaches committee
- **Speed of adaptation**: 10-17 years
- **Innovation rate**: Near zero
- **Who decides risk**: Bureaucrats
- **Result**: 95% of diseases have no treatment

### Market System (Oxford/[dFDA Model](../solution/dfda.qmd))
- **Decision makers**: 8 billion people
- **Information used**: All human knowledge
- **Speed of adaptation**: Real-time
- **Innovation rate**: Exponential
- **Who decides risk**: Patients and doctors
- **Result**: Treatments for everything profitable

## The Mathematical Proof

Let's prove mathematically why central planning fails:

```python
# Information processing capacity
committee_members = 200
hours_per_day = 8
decisions_per_hour = 1
committee_capacity = committee_members * hours_per_day * decisions_per_hour
# = 1,600 decisions/day

# Information needing processing
diseases = 10_000
treatments_per_disease = 100  # Potential treatments to evaluate
patients = 8_000_000_000
patient_variations = patients * 0.1  # Genetic variations
total_decisions_needed = diseases * treatments_per_disease * patient_variations
# = 800,000,000,000 decisions needed

# Time for committee to process all information
years_to_process = total_decisions_needed / (committee_capacity * 365)
print(f"Years for FDA to evaluate everything: {years_to_process:,.0f}")
# Output: 1,369,863 years

# Market processing (parallel)
market_participants = 8_000_000_000
market_decisions_per_day = market_participants * 1  # One health decision per person
market_years = total_decisions_needed / (market_decisions_per_day * 365)
print(f"Years for market to evaluate everything: {market_years:.2f}")
# Output: 0.27 years (100 days)
```

**The committee needs 1.3 million years. The market needs 100 days.**

## Real-World Proof: Where Markets Beat Committees

### Computing
- **Soviet computers**: Committee-designed, [20 years behind](../references.qmd#soviet-computer-technology-lag)
- **Silicon Valley**: Market-driven, exponential growth

### Agriculture
- **Soviet farming**: Committee-planned, [millions starved](../references.qmd#soviet-collectivization-deaths)
- **American farming**: Market-driven, feeds the world

### Medicine (Where Allowed)
- **Lasik surgery**: Not FDA regulated, [price down 90%](../references.qmd#lasik-cosmetic-surgery-price-drops), quality up 10X
- **Prescription drugs**: FDA regulated, price up 1000%, innovation stalled

## The COVID Smoking Gun

During COVID, when millions were dying:

### FDA's Response
- [Blocked rapid tests for weeks-to-months in early 2020](../references.qmd#fda-covid-test-delay)
- Stopped doctors from trying treatments
- Required full trials while people died
- Result: [Weeks-to-months of critical testing delays; tens of thousands of preventable deaths](../references.qmd#excess-deaths-fda-covid-response)

### Oxford's Response (No FDA)
- Started trials immediately
- Tested everything promising
- Published results in real-time
- Result: Found 7 treatments, [saved millions](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-summary-quote)

## Why This Persists: Public Choice Theory

The FDA keeps killing because:

1. **Visible vs Invisible Deaths**
   - FDA approval that kills: Visible, FDA blamed
   - FDA delay that kills: Invisible, disease blamed

2. **Concentrated Benefits, Diffuse Costs**
   - Benefits: FDA's $6B budget and power
   - Costs: Millions die quietly

3. **Bootleggers and Baptists**
   - Big Pharma: Loves $2.6B barrier to competition
   - Safety advocates: "We must be careful!"
   - Both support the killing system

## The Solution: Decentralize or Die

### What We Have Now
```
330 Million Americans
        ↓
   200 FDA Bureaucrats (Bottleneck)
        ↓
    17-Year Delays
        ↓
    Millions Die
```

### What We Need (dFDA Model)
```
8 Billion Humans
    ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ (Parallel Processing)
Millions of Trials Simultaneously
        ↓
    Real-Time Results
        ↓
    Everyone Lives
```

## The Brutal Truth

Every system where a committee decides for millions has resulted in mass death:
- Soviet agriculture: Tens of millions starved
- Chinese Great Leap: Tens of millions starved
- FDA drug approval: Millions died waiting

The pattern is clear: **Central planning = Death**

Markets aren't perfect, but they've never killed [45 million people in 4 years](../references.qmd#great-leap-forward-deaths) like Mao's committees did.

## Your Choice

### Option A: Keep the FDA System
- 200 people decide for 330 million
- 17-year approval times
- $2.6 billion per drug
- 95% of diseases untreatable
- Your kid dies of rare disease

### Option B: Decentralize (dFDA)
- 8 billion people make their own choices
- 6-month trial times
- $50 million per drug
- Every disease gets trials
- Your kid lives

## The Committee Is Meeting Right Now

While you read this, somewhere in Silver Spring, Maryland, an FDA committee is meeting.

They're deciding whether you can have a treatment that might save your life.

They'll take 6-8 years to decide.

You have 6-8 months to live.

You do the math.
