## The Nobel Prize for Cynicism

In 1986, James Buchanan won the Nobel Prize in Economics for proving what everyone already knew:

**People don't suddenly become angels when they work for the government.**

This is Public Choice Theory: bureaucrats, politicians, and regulators are **just as selfish** as everyone else.

They just have better PR.

## The Core Insight

Traditional economics assumes:
- Private sector: Selfish, profit-maximizing
- Public sector: Benevolent, serving the public good

Public Choice Theory says:
- Private sector: Selfish, profit-maximizing
- Public sector: **Also selfish, also profit-maximizing**

The only difference is what they're maximizing.

## What Government Workers Actually Maximize

### Bureaucrats Maximize
- Budget size (bigger budget = more power)
- Job security (no customer complaints = no accountability)
- Avoiding responsibility (delays protect from blame)
- Personal prestige (regulations make them important)

**Not**: Public welfare, efficiency, or results

### Politicians Maximize
- Campaign donations (from whoever pays)
- Re-election probability (not voter welfare)
- Power and influence
- Post-office lobbying jobs

**Not**: What voters actually want

### Regulators Maximize
- Future job prospects (revolving door to industry)
- Not getting sued (delays are safe)
- Expanding authority (more rules = more power)
- Personal reputation (in the industry they'll join)

**Not**: Public safety or effective regulation

## Why This Matters for Medical Research

### The NIH Maximizes

**What They Should Maximize**: Cures per dollar

**What They Actually Maximize**:
- Number of grants awarded (looks productive)
- Papers published (looks scientific)
- Budget growth (more power)
- Avoiding scandal (no risky research)

**Result**: $48 billion spent, zero diseases eradicated in 50 years

### The FDA Maximizes

**What They Should Maximize**: Lives saved per year

**What They Actually Maximize**:
- Avoiding blame if a drug harms someone (visible)
- NOT avoiding blame if delay kills someone (invisible)
- Personal career advancement (revolving door to pharma)
- Regulatory power (more rules = more important)

**Result**: 17-year drug approval, millions die waiting

## The Incentive Mismatch

| Actor | Should Maximize | Actually Maximizes | Result |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| NIH | Cures | Grants awarded | No cures |
| FDA | Lives saved | Avoiding lawsuits | Deadly delays |
| Congress | Voter welfare | Campaign donations | Corporate welfare |
| Pharma | Health outcomes | Recurring revenue | Chronic disease preferred |

**Nobody in the system is incentivized to cure disease.**

## The Beautiful Part: This Is Predictable

Since everyone maximizes their own interest:
- You can predict their behavior
- You can design around it
- You can align their interests with good outcomes

**You don't need good people. You need good incentives.**

## How to Align Selfish Interests with Cures

### Current System (Misaligned)

**FDA Regulator**:
- Approves risky drug → Someone dies → Regulator blamed → Career ruined
- Delays drug → Thousands die → Nobody notices → Regulator safe
- **Incentive**: Delay everything

**Pharma Company**:
- Cures disease → Customer lost → No recurring revenue
- Treats disease → Recurring revenue forever
- **Incentive**: Treat, don't cure

### Fixed System (Aligned)

**dFDA Participant**:
- Joins trial → Gets paid
- Shares data → Contributes to cure
- Cure found → Everyone benefits
- **Incentive**: Participate and share data

**Pharma Company (Under DIH)**:
- Runs trial → Patients pay them (via subsidy)
- Fast results → Run more trials
- Cure found → Reputation boost + more trials
- **Incentive**: Find cures quickly

## The Calculation Every Bureaucrat Makes

### FDA Official Deciding on Drug Approval

**Approve quickly**:
- Upside: Drug might save 10,000 lives/year
- Downside: If 10 people die from side effects, Congressional hearing, career over
- **Expected value for bureaucrat**: -$2 million (lost career)

**Delay**:
- Upside: No risk to career, safe choice
- Downside: 10,000 people die per year of delay (but nobody blames you)
- **Expected value for bureaucrat**: $0 (career safe)

**Rational choice for selfish bureaucrat**: **Delay**

### NIH Reviewer Deciding on Grant

**Fund risky, innovative research**:
- Upside: Might cure disease (but colleague gets credit)
- Downside: Might fail (you approved it, look bad)
- **Expected value for reviewer**: -1 (negative career impact)

**Fund safe, incremental research**:
- Upside: Unlikely to fail (safe choice)
- Downside: Won't cure anything (but nobody notices)
- **Expected value for reviewer**: 0 (career safe)

**Rational choice for selfish reviewer**: **Safe, useless research**

## This Is Why Every Government Program Fails

It's not because government workers are evil. **It's because they're human.**

And humans respond to incentives.

### The Pattern

1. Create government agency to solve problem
2. Agency staff maximize their own interests
3. Their interests conflict with solving the problem
4. Problem doesn't get solved
5. Agency asks for more budget to "do better"
6. Repeat forever

### Examples

- **War on Drugs**: DEA maximizes budget → Needs drugs to stay illegal → War continues
- **War on Poverty**: Welfare administrators maximize beneficiaries → Need poor people → Poverty continues
- **War on Disease**: NIH maximizes grants → Needs diseases to study → Diseases continue

## The Solution: Remove Discretion

You can't make bureaucrats less selfish. But you can **remove their ability to be selfish**.

### Traditional System
```
Patient → Doctor → FDA Reviewer → (Reviewer's selfish calculation) → Delay
```

### dFDA System
```
Patient → Doctor → Trial → Data → Algorithm → Result
```

No humans in the approval chain = No human selfishness

### Wishocracy
```
People → Budget Preferences → Smart Contract → Automatic Allocation
```

No politicians in the funding chain = No political corruption

## Using Selfishness for Good

### VICTORY Bonds

We **want** investors to be selfish.

**Their selfish interest**: 40-270% returns
**Requires**: Treaty gets passed, diseases get cured
**Result**: Their selfishness funds the cure

### Patient Trial Participation

We **want** patients to be selfish.

**Their selfish interest**: Get paid $100-500, maybe get cured
**Requires**: Participate in trial, share data
**Result**: Their selfishness generates data for cures

### Pharma Companies

We **want** pharma to be selfish.

**Their selfish interest**: Make money on trials
**Under DIH**: They get paid to run trials (not sell drugs)
**Result**: Their selfishness generates cures

## The Libertarian Paradox

**Libertarians say**: Government fails because it's run by self-interested people

**Socialists say**: Government fails because it's underfunded

**Public Choice Theory says**: Government fails because self-interested people are in positions where their interests conflict with good outcomes

**The solution**: Design systems where self-interest produces good outcomes

## Why This Is Liberating

You don't need to:
- Find virtuous leaders
- Hope politicians care
- Wait for bureaucrats to change
- Convince anyone to be less selfish

You just need to **align their selfishness with your goals**.

## The Bottom Line

Everyone is selfish. That's not the problem.

**The problem is systems that reward selfishness that kills people.**

The solution is systems that reward selfishness that cures disease:
- VICTORY Bonds: Greed funds the cure
- Patient subsidies: Selfishness generates data
- Pharma payments: Profit motive finds cures
- Wishocracy: No humans to corrupt

**We're not making people better. We're making better systems for selfish people.**

And since everyone's selfish, those systems will actually work.
