## The Nobel Prize Winner Who Explained Why Socialism Kills People

Friedrich Hayek won a Nobel Prize for noticing something obvious: No committee can know everything.

The Soviet Union had the smartest economists. They had supercomputers. They had total power.

They couldn't figure out how many shoes to make.

Result: 30 million people starved to death.

The NIH has brilliant scientists. They have unlimited data. They have $48 billion.

They can't figure out which diseases to cure.

Result: 15 million people die annually from treatable diseases.

Same problem. Same outcome. Different corpses.

## The Knowledge Problem (Or: Why Your Mom Knows Your Pain Better Than the NIH)

Every person knows:

- What hurts
- How much it hurts
- What they'd pay to stop it hurting
- What treatments work for them
- What side effects they can tolerate

The NIH knows:

- What their committees think is important
- What lobbyists tell them
- What gets published in journals
- What won't get them sued
- Jack shit about your specific pain

Who should decide what diseases to cure?

Currently: 200 people in Maryland.

Obviously better: 8 billion people experiencing actual diseases.

## The Shoe Factory Problem (But With Cancer)

Soviet central planning, 1980s:

- Committee decides everyone needs work boots
- Factories make 10 million work boots
- People need dress shoes
- People trade boots for vodka
- Everyone drunk, no one has shoes

NIH central planning, today:

- Committee decides to fund Alzheimer's research
- $3.7 billion goes to Alzheimer's
- Your kid has rare genetic disease
- No funding for rare diseases
- Your kid dies
- Committee keeps funding Alzheimer's

The problem isn't evil committees. It's the existence of committees.

## Why Markets Know Everything (And Committees Know Nothing)

Markets aggregate information through prices. It's magic, except it's math.

Example: Hurricane coming to Florida

- One guy notices weather patterns
- Buys plywood
- Price goes up slightly
- Others notice price change
- They buy plywood
- Price rises more
- Soon everyone knows hurricane is coming
- Not because of weather reports
- Because of plywood prices

No committee needed. No central planning. The information spreads automatically through price signals.

Now apply this to medical research:

- Patient desperate for treatment
- Willing to pay/participate in trials
- Researchers notice demand
- Develop treatment
- Others see success
- More researchers pile in
- Disease gets cured

No committee needed. The system solves itself.

## The NIH: Soviet Central Planning With Better PR

The NIH process:

1. Committee of "experts" meets
2. Decide what's important (usually wrong)
3. Allocate billions (usually wrongly)
4. Reject 90% of applications (mostly good ones)
5. Fund safe, incremental research (useless)
6. Wonder why we haven't cured anything in 50 years

It's literally how the Soviets allocated resources. We just call it "peer review" instead of "five-year plan."

Both failed for the same reason: The knowledge problem.

## Your Body Is Not a Standardized Widget

Every human is different:

- Different genetics
- Different environments
- Different responses to drugs
- Different risk tolerances
- Different values

The FDA/NIH assumes everyone is identical:

- Same dose for everyone
- Same treatment protocols
- Same acceptable risks
- Same outcome metrics
- Same definition of "success"

This is why treatments work for some and kill others. We're treating humans like mass-produced cars.

Markets don't make this mistake. Amazon recommends different products to different people. Netflix suggests different shows. Markets understand heterogeneity.

Medicine pretends it doesn't exist.

## The Distributed Knowledge Network

8 billion humans collectively know:

- Every symptom of every disease
- Every treatment response
- Every side effect
- Every quality of life impact
- Every cost-benefit calculation

This knowledge is distributed across billions of brains. No committee can access it. No survey can capture it. No database can store it.

But markets can use it.

Through prices, choices, and revealed preferences, markets automatically aggregate all this distributed knowledge into actionable information.

## The Fatal Conceit (Thinking You're Smarter Than Everyone)

The NIH thinks 200 reviewers can allocate $48 billion better than markets.

This is like thinking:

- 200 people can plan what 330 million should eat
- 200 people can decide what everyone should wear
- 200 people can determine what music everyone should hear
- 200 people can pick what diseases everyone should cure

We tried this. It was called the Soviet Union. Everyone starved.

## Why Markets Beat Committees (Every Single Time)

Markets have beaten central planning in:

- Food distribution (supermarkets vs bread lines)
- Technology development (Silicon Valley vs Soviet tech)
- Entertainment (Hollywood vs state propaganda)
- Transportation (Uber vs government taxis)
- Communication (Internet vs state media)

But somehow we think medicine is different?

Medicine is the ONE area where central planning magically works?

Narrator: It doesn't.

## The Information Asymmetry Problem

You know:

- Your exact symptoms
- Your pain level (1-10)
- Your quality of life impact
- Your financial situation
- Your risk tolerance

Your doctor knows:

- What you tell them in 15 minutes
- What tests show (incomplete picture)
- What insurance covers
- What won't get them sued

The NIH knows:

- Statistical averages
- Published research (biased)
- Political priorities
- Nothing about you specifically

Who should make decisions about your treatment?

Currently: The people who know the least (NIH/FDA).

## The Prediction Market Solution

Instead of committees guessing what to fund, create prediction markets:

- "Will Treatment X cure Disease Y?"
- People bet real money
- Aggregates all available information
- Weighted by confidence (bigger bets = more confidence)
- Self-correcting (wrong bets lose money)

Prediction markets have beaten experts in:

- Election outcomes
- Stock prices
- Sports results
- Weather forecasting
- Everything else we've tested

Why not use them for medical research?

Because that would make committees obsolete.

## The Decentralized Trial Revolution

Current system (centralized):

- NIH picks winners
- FDA approves protocols
- Patients have no choice
- Researchers follow rigid rules
- 95% of diseases get ignored

Market system (decentralized):

- Patients choose trials
- Researchers compete for patients
- Protocols adapt to results
- Every disease gets attention
- Markets allocate resources

It's the difference between Soviet groceries and Whole Foods.

## The Local Knowledge Advantage

Your neighbor with diabetes knows more about living with diabetes than any NIH committee.

Your friend with cancer knows more about cancer treatment reality than any FDA panel.

Your mom with arthritis knows more about pain management than any research review board.

This knowledge is:

- Specific
- Contextual
- Experiential
- Impossible to centralize
- Valuable beyond measure

Markets use this knowledge. Committees ignore it.

## The Speed of Information

Markets process information in milliseconds.
Committees process information in years.

When COVID hit:

- Markets knew in January 2020 (stock prices crashed)
- WHO knew in March 2020 (declared pandemic)
- Governments knew in April 2020 (locked down)

Markets are always first because they aggregate information from everyone, instantly.

Committees are always last because they wait for official reports from official sources through official channels.

By the time a committee acts, the information is already old.

## The Solution: Let Everyone Decide Everything

Instead of 200 people deciding what diseases to cure:

- 8 billion people vote with participation
- Researchers follow the demand
- Treatments emerge organically
- Resources flow automatically
- Diseases get cured

It's not anarchy. It's emergence.

Like how:

- Languages evolved without committees
- Cities grew without central planning
- Internet developed without government
- Ecosystems balance without management

Complex systems self-organize better than any committee can organize them.

## The Beautiful Truth

Hayek's insight wasn't complicated:

No group of experts, no matter how smart, can know what millions of individuals know collectively.

The NIH cannot possibly know:

- What diseases hurt most
- What treatments might work
- What risks people will accept
- What outcomes matter most

But 8 billion humans know all of this, collectively.

We just need a system that uses their knowledge instead of ignoring it.

That system exists. It's called a market.

We've just been too proud to use it.

*P.S. - If you think committees are smarter than markets, explain why the iPhone exists and Soviet smartphones don't. Same intelligence available to both systems. One created the modern world. The other created bread lines. The difference wasn't the people. It was the system.*
