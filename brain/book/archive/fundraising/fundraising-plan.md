# Fundraising Plan: The $2.5B Activation Energy

_This is the overview file for the fundraising epic. See detailed documents in this folder for specifics._

## Executive Summary

The capital required for the 1% Treaty is not for ongoing operations—it is a one-time "activation energy" to overcome political inertia and unlock **$27+ billion annually** for global health.

**Total Requirement:** $1.2B - $2.5B over 36 months

## Multi-Phase Strategy

### Phase 1: Seed Round ($250M - $400M)

- Build referendum platform and legal frameworks
- Prove model in pilot countries
- **Milestone:** 50M verified participants OR pro-treaty majority in G20 nation

### Phase 2: Series A ($500M - $1B)

- Scale to all G7 nations
- Achieve 3.5% global participation (280M people)
- **Milestone:** 3.5% threshold OR first G7 treaty commitment

### Phase 3: Growth Round ($500M - $1.1B)

- Secure ratification in major powers (US, EU, China)
- Capitalize DIH treasury for first year
- **Milestone:** First $1B disbursement

## Key Innovation: Pay-for-Success Model

All major expenditures are structured with performance incentives:

- **Legal fees:** Success fees paid in VICTORY bonds upon ratification
- **Political campaigns:** Competitive prize ecosystem for first ratifications
- **Tech development:** Bonuses tied to platform performance
- **Team compensation:** Equity-heavy, mission-aligned incentives
