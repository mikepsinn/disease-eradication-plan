## Introduction

Here's the dirty secret about American democracy: It's perfectly legal to buy politicians. You just have to use the right forms. The Supreme Court decided that money equals speech (Citizens United, 2010), which means billionaires speak louder than you. 

Good news: You're about to become the loudest voice in the room.

This chapter teaches you how to legally deploy $250 million to make politicians choose between supporting your treaty or losing their jobs. Every technique here is legal. Every technique here is also disgusting. And every technique here is temporary - a means to an end, not the end itself.

## The Legal Landscape: Money Is Speech

### Citizens United Changed Everything

In 2010, the Supreme Court gave you a gift: unlimited political spending. As detailed in [the Legal Framework chapter](legal-framework.qmd), you'll deploy multiple legal entities for different purposes. Here's how to use them tactically:

**Super PACs (Independent Expenditure Committees):**

- Raise unlimited money from anyone
- Spend unlimited amounts on elections
- Run ads saying "Senator X kills babies" (if factual)
- Cannot coordinate with candidates (wink wink)

**501(c)(4) "Social Welfare" Organizations:**

- Don't have to disclose donors (dark money)
- Can engage in political activity (just not primarily)
- Perfect for foreign money (technically illegal but unenforceable)
- The NRA model: "education" that happens to be political

**527 Organizations:**

- Like Super PACs but for "issue advocacy"
- Can say "call Senator X about dead children" 
- Slightly different tax treatment
- Less regulated than Super PACs

You'll use all three. Diversification isn't just for portfolios.

## The Super PAC Strategy

### Setting Up "Cure Not Kill PAC"

**Formation (One Day):**

1. File FEC Form 1 (Statement of Organization)
2. Get an EIN from IRS
3. Open a bank account
4. Start taking unlimited money
5. Begin destroying political careers

**The Legal Requirements:**

- File reports with FEC (monthly in election years)
- Include disclaimer on all ads ("Paid for by Cure Not Kill PAC")
- No coordination with candidates (this is a federal felony - don't do it)
- Keep records of all donors over $200
- Report independent expenditures within 48 hours

**What You Can Do:**

- Run attack ads against treaty opponents
- Support ads for treaty supporters
- Hire armies of canvassers
- Buy entire media markets
- Fund opposition research
- Create viral content
- Anything except directly bribing candidates

## The 501(c)(4) Dark Money Machine

### The DIH Action Fund (Your Dark Money Vehicle)

This is your 501(c)(4) dark money vehicle. Unlike Super PACs, you don't have to disclose donors.

**The 51/49 Rule:**

- 51% must be "social welfare" activity
- 49% can be pure political destruction
- "Education" about treaty benefits = social welfare
- "Senator X is a murderer" ads = political

**How to Stay Legal:**

1. Write educational materials about the treaty benefits
2. Educate the public on voting records
3. Run issue advocacy (no "vote for" language)
4. Stay within the 51% social welfare / 49% political split
5. Keep excellent records to prove compliance

## Campaign Finance Jujitsu

### Making Opposition Expensive

**The Primary Threat:**

- Find primary challengers for treaty opponents
- Fund them with $5-10M each
- Force opponents to spend $20M defending
- Even if they win, they're weakened and poor
- Next election, they support you to avoid this

**The Bidding War:**

- Publicly announce $10M against treaty opponents
- Wait for defense contractors to counter
- Raise to $20M
- They match
- Keep escalating until they break
- You have $250M, they have stockholders to answer to

**The Overwhelming Force Doctrine:**

- Pick one opponent to destroy completely
- Spend $50M in their small state
- Make them lose by 40 points
- Every other politician gets the message
- Total cost: $50M. Political control: Priceless

## State and Local Compliance

Every state has different rules. Here's how to handle them:

### The Nightmare States

**California:** Requires extensive disclosure, frequent reporting
**New York:** Complex registration, strict coordination rules
**Texas:** Actually pretty loose, go wild

### The Compliance Strategy

- Create separate state PACs for complex states
- Use federal Super PAC for simple states
- Route money through appropriate entities
- Hire local lawyers who know the rules
- When in doubt, seek legal counsel before acting

### Local Elections

- City councils: $50K buys a seat
- State legislators: $200K flips most races
- Governors: $5-10M moves the needle
- Focus on cheap races with treaty impact

## The Media Buy Strategy

### Surgical Strikes

**Early and Often:**

- Define opponents before they define themselves
- First impression sticks
- Run attacks during non-political shows
- Capture low-information voters

**The Saturation Approach:**

- Buy every ad slot in small markets
- Make opposition invisible
- Cost: $500K/week in Wyoming
- Impact: Total narrative control

**Digital Micro-Targeting:**

- Facebook: $0.50 per voter reached
- Google: Target searches for "Senator [Name]"
- YouTube: Pre-roll on local news
- TikTok: Pay influencers to "discover" treaty benefits

## The Ground Game

### Paid "Volunteers"

- Hire 10,000 "volunteers" at $20/hour
- They happen to support the treaty
- They knock doors, make calls, register voters
- Completely legal if disclosed properly
- Call them "organizers" not volunteers

### The Petition Army

- Gather signatures for ballot initiatives
- Each signature costs $3-5
- 100,000 signatures = massive pressure
- Politicians see organized opposition
- They fold immediately

## Enforcement: What Happens If You Break Rules

### FEC Enforcement (LOL)

- Requires 4 of 6 commissioners to act
- Always split 3-3 on party lines
- Average investigation: 2-4 years
- Average fine: $50K
- Worth it for the impact

### DOJ Enforcement (Rare but Real)

- Criminal prosecution for knowing violations
- Foreign money = serious crime
- Coordination = potential felony
- Keep good lawyers on retainer
- Document everything as "independent"

### State Enforcement (Varies)

- Some states have aggressive enforcement (New York, California)
- Some states have minimal oversight (Delaware)
- Compliance requirements vary significantly by state
- Budget for legal counsel in each state ($50-100K per state)
- Full compliance is cheaper than fines and bad press

## The Lobbying Registration Trap

### When You Must Register

- Direct contact with officials about legislation
- Spending over $3,000/quarter on lobbying
- Coordinating grassroots campaigns
- Paying others to lobby

### When You Don't

- "Education" about issues
- Grassroots organizing (if genuine)
- Media campaigns
- Think tank research
- Public speeches

Stay on the non-registration side when possible. Registered lobbyists have restrictions.

## International Considerations

### Foreign Nationals Ban

- Foreign citizens cannot donate to US political activities
- Foreign citizens cannot direct how money is spent on US elections
- Strict firewall required between international and US operations
- US political operations must be 100% US-funded and US-controlled
- Violation is a federal crime - take this seriously

### Treaty Promotion

- International treaty promotion is complex legally
- Requires separate legal analysis for each jurisdiction
- Consult with election law experts before any international spending

## The Victory Conditions

### Phase 1: Create Fear (Months 1-6)

- $50M in attack ads
- Target 10 key opponents
- 3-5 lose primaries
- Rest get message

### Phase 2: Offer Carrots (Months 7-12)

- $50M in positive ads for supporters
- Create "treaty heroes"
- Make support politically profitable
- Opponents start switching

### Phase 3: Ensure Victory (Months 13-18)

- $200M surge for final push
- Overwhelming force in key states
- Make opposition political suicide
- Treaty passes with 70%+ support

## Conclusion: Democracy as Designed

You're not corrupting democracy - you're using it exactly as the Supreme Court intended. Every technique here is legal. Every dollar spent is protected speech. Every politician destroyed chose their fate.

The campaign finance system is a game with published rules. The current players (defense contractors, pharma, insurance) have been winning for decades. You're just better at the game. You have more money, better strategy, and most importantly - dead children on your side.

Remember: It's not bribery if you use the right forms. It's not corruption if the Supreme Court says it's speech. And it's not illegal if everyone else is doing it too.

The treaty opponents have two choices: Support you and keep their jobs, or oppose you and lose everything. That's not a threat. That's democracy.

## Legal Notice

This chapter describes legal campaign finance activities under current US law. Consult with election lawyers before implementing. Laws change, enforcement varies, and what's technically legal might still look terrible in headlines. Always hire excellent lawyers.
