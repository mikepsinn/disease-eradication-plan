  > Programmers lagged 6-8 years behind American counterparts
  > Committee-based bureaucratic design: Uncoordinated government ministries; five-year plans from bureaucratic managers lacking technical know-how
  > Political decisions overrode scientist/engineer opinions in selecting technology cores
  > Copying Western hardware + international isolation + industrial structure = expanding lag through 1980s
  > Lack of common standards for peripherals and digital storage capacity caused significant lag
