This analysis reveals the shocking reality of humanity's spending priorities by visualizing our global "family budget" with the **total economic burden** of war and disease, including all externalities.

**Key Insight**: When you include all externalities, war and disease consume a massive portion of global GDP - far more than just direct spending.


## Global Spending Priorities

Before diving into detailed analysis, it's important to understand the fundamental scale of global military spending relative to medical research. This chart visualizes the core trade-off at the heart of this initiative.

## Humanity's Annual Budget: The True Scale

This bar chart provides an accurate and honest visualization of humanity's spending priorities by directly comparing them to global GDP. It makes the scale of the war and disease problems starkly clear.

**The Shocking Reality**: The total economic burdens of War and Disease *exceed* our entire planet's annual economic output.

## The Core Problem: Disease Burden vs. Research Investment

The most critical insight comes from comparing the *total economic burden* of disease, a staggering [$109 trillion annually](../references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t), with what we spend to solve it. This chart visualizes that extreme disparity. The size of the problem versus our investment in the solution is the central economic argument for this initiative.

## The Shocking Conclusion

**The Punchline**: War and disease consume **$119 trillion** annually (113% of global GDP!) when you include all externalities, yet we only spend [**$67.5 billion**](../references.qmd#global-gov-med-research-spending) on medical research. This is the largest market failure in human history.

This analysis reveals that humanity's spending priorities are fundamentally broken. We spend more on the problems than on the solutions, creating a massive opportunity for intervention through the 1% Treaty initiative.
