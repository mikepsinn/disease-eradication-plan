This appendix identifies specific U.S. regulations, rules, and guidance documents that could be modified or rescinded to significantly reduce the cost and time required to bring new medical interventions to patients, particularly through the use of a large-scale, automated, decentralized clinical trial platform (the dFDA). The goal is not elimination but streamlining and adapting requirements to be more efficient, technology-enabled, and patient-centric while maintaining high standards for safety and efficacy.

*This document serves as the detailed policy roadmap supporting the proposals in Part II: The Solution and Part IV: The Plan.*

- **State Laws & Regulations (Telehealth, Pharmacy Practice, Professional Licensing):**
  - *Area for Review:* Inconsistent state-level requirements impede the ability to run seamless nationwide/global DCTs, manage remote patient care, ship medications directly, and utilize healthcare professionals across state lines.
  - *Potential Modifications:* **Advocate for federal preemption or promote interstate compacts to harmonize state laws relevant to DCTs.** Establish national standards for telehealth practice, remote prescribing, and cross-state licensing portability specifically for the purpose of participating in registered platform-based clinical trials.

### Specific Modifications/Repeals for dFDA Enablement

- **Reform Charging for Investigational Drugs (21 CFR 312.8):**
  - *Area for Review:* Current interpretation allows only cost recovery, limiting market incentives.
  - *Potential Modifications:* Explicitly permit **market-based pricing and profit potential** for investigational drugs within dFDA trials through revised interpretation or guidance. Repeal the interpretation limiting charges strictly to cost-recovery to allow market forces to incentivize R&D and scaling.

- **Streamline/Simplify IND Requirements (21 CFR Part 312):**
  - *Area for Review:* Rigid, document-heavy requirements ill-suited for adaptive/decentralized trials, especially on certified platforms; potential bias against innovative designs.
  - *Potential Modifications:* Create a significantly streamlined IND pathway. For trials on **certified** dFDA Infrastructures, **reduce IND submission to essential preclinical safety, manufacturing quality, and protocol only**, relying on platform monitoring for ongoing safety. Repeal requirements for extensive upfront documentation rendered redundant by platform capabilities. Support validation of **AI/ML tools for automated protocol checking/validation** prior to submission via guidance. Issue guidance explicitly **maximizing sponsor flexibility** in choosing scientifically valid trial designs (adaptive, pragmatic, N-of-1, platform trials, etc.) verifiable via the platform, repealing interpretations favoring traditional designs.

- **Simplify Informed Consent & Facilitate Secondary Data Use (21 CFR Part 50 / 45 CFR Part 164 - HIPAA):**
  - *Area for Review:* Lengthy, paternalistic forms; bureaucratic burdens; barriers to secondary research use.
  - *Potential Modifications:* Encourage/provide safe harbor via guidance for technology-driven consent (interactive modules, video). Focus regulations on clear communication of *material* risks/benefits. Repeal prescriptive format/process requirements. **Modify guidance to explicitly facilitate broad opt-out consent models for secondary research use** of appropriately anonymized/aggregated dFDA data, managed via the platform. Repeal interpretations hindering secondary use when robust, patient-controlled privacy mechanisms exist.

- **Reduce/Repeal GCP Burden & Maximize Design Flexibility (ICH E6 / FDA Guidance):**
  - *Area for Review:* Disproportionate administrative/cost burdens from prescriptive process focus; potential bias against innovative designs.
  - *Potential Modifications:* Define a simplified "dFDA-GCP" standard via guidance. Leverage platform automation, data immutability, and monitoring. **Repeal specific requirements for manual SDV, extensive on-site monitoring, and non-critical documentation** fulfilled by a certified platform. **Issue guidance explicitly maximizing sponsor flexibility** in choosing scientifically valid trial designs verifiable via the platform, repealing interpretations favoring traditional designs.

- **Maximize Use of Real-World Evidence (RWE) & Support Reimbursement Decisions (FDA RWE Guidances):**
  - *Area for Review:* Overly cautious guidance limiting RWE use for efficacy; lack of clear signaling for payers.
  - *Potential Modifications:* Issue clear, permissive guidance allowing high-quality dFDA-generated RWE as **primary evidence** for regulatory decisions (efficacy, safety, label expansion). Repeal guidance interpretations hindering use of robust platform RWE. **Explicitly state that such evidence is suitable for informing healthcare payer/HTA decisions.**

- **Minimize/Repeal Post-Marketing Requirements/Commitments (e.g., 21 CFR Part 314, Subpart H; Part 601, Subpart E; Part 822):**
  - *Area for Review:* Duplicative mandated studies add costs/delays when platform provides continuous monitoring.
  - *Potential Modifications:* Allow dFDA's perpetual monitoring to fulfill post-marketing surveillance needs for approved treatments. **Repeal regulations requiring separate mandated studies or reporting** where the certified dFDA Infrastructure provides continuous, sufficient real-world safety and effectiveness data.

- **Repeal Restrictions on Truthful Promotion & Scientific Exchange (21 CFR Part 202, FDA Guidances):**
  - *Area for Review:* Strict FDA rules limiting truthful communication constitute prior restraint on speech.
  - *Potential Modifications:* **Repeal regulations and guidance interpretations** that restrict truthful, non-misleading communication about dFDA trials (including real-time data trends) and emerging RWE for approved drugs. Rely on transparency, anti-fraud laws, and provider/patient evaluation rather than government pre-clearance or content restrictions.

- **Replace/Repeal REMS Requirements via dFDA Monitoring (21 CFR Part 208):**
  - *Area for Review:* Significant burdens from REMS programs redundant with platform capabilities.
  - *Potential Modifications:* Allow robust dFDA Infrastructure monitoring (tracking usage, AEs, outcomes) to satisfy requirements. **Repeal the requirement for separate mandated REMS programs** where a certified dFDA Infrastructure can verifiably achieve the same safety goals with less burden.
