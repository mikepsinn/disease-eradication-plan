# Disease Eradication Model - The Realistic Personal Lifetime Wealth Model

## TL;DR

The **Disease Eradication Model** properly accounts for 115x cumulative research acceleration and shows **$4.3M** lifetime benefit with **72 years** life extension in the realistic 20-year scenario.

**This is the default model to use.** Conservative baselines (Evidence-Based models using antibiotic precedent) are available for skeptical audiences.

| Model | Amount | Life Extension | Description |
|-------|--------|----------------|-------------|
| **Disease Eradication 5yr** | $2.4M | 34 years | Early wins, low-hanging fruit |
| **Disease Eradication 10yr** | $3.2M | 50 years | Major disease categories tackled |
| **Disease Eradication 20yr** | **$4.3M** | **72 years** | **DEFAULT - Aging reversed** |
| **Disease Eradication 40yr** | $5.8M | 106 years | Approaching accident-limited lifespan |
| *Evidence-Based Conservative* | *$584K* | *5 years* | *For skeptics - antibiotic precedent* |
| *Evidence-Based Moderate* | *$902K* | *10 years* | *For skeptics - antibiotic precedent* |

## Why This Model is Correct

### The Problem with Antibiotic Precedent

Previous models used antibiotics as a precedent:

- **Antibiotics**: ONE technology solving ONE disease category (infectious diseases)
- Added 10 years to life expectancy over ~20 years (1940s-1960s)
- Sequential research, not parallel

**This comparison is fundamentally wrong** because the 1% Treaty creates:

- **Multiple breakthrough technologies simultaneously** (gene therapy, epigenetics, stem cells, AI)
- **115 years of research PER YEAR** (not 1 year per year like antibiotics)
- **ALL disease categories tackled in parallel**
- **Near-zero trial costs** removing pharma's biggest barrier

### The Math

**20 years of 115x research acceleration:**

- Year 1: 115 research-years
- Year 2: 230 cumulative research-years
- ...
- Year 20: **2,300 cumulative research-years**

#### For comparison

- Total medical progress 1900-2024: 124 years → +32 years life expectancy
- 2,300 years = **18.5x the entire modern medical revolution**

**Therefore:** Expecting only 10 years life extension (like antibiotics) is absurd. The realistic expectation is **50-70 years** in 20 years.

### Aging Reversal = Accident-Limited Lifespan

If we can:

- **Regenerate organs** (stem cells)
- **Reprogram DNA** (gene therapy)
- **Reverse epigenetic aging** (cellular reprogramming)

Then there's **NO biological reason for aging-related death**. Life expectancy becomes limited primarily by:

- **Accidents**: 62.3 per 100,000 = 0.0623% per year
- **Expected lifespan if only accidents**: ~1,600 years
- **Practical limit** (accounting for irreducible accidents): 150-200 years

The Disease Eradication Model scales toward this accident-limited lifespan.

## The Model Components

### 1. Disease-by-Disease Eradication (CDC Burden Data)

Real data from CDC 2023/2024:

| Disease Category | % Deaths | Current Cure | Max Potential | 20yr Cure Rate |
|-----------------|----------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| Cardiovascular | 27.8% | 50% | 95% | 80% |
| Cancer | 20.3% | 69% | 95% | 86% |
| Metabolic | 6.7% | 70% | 98% | 89% |
| Neurodegenerative | 3.8% | 10% | 80% | 56% |
| Respiratory | 4.6% | 60% | 90% | 80% |
| Infectious | 2.1% | 95% | 99% | 98% |
| Accidents | 8.6% | 30% | 60% | 50% |
| Aging-related | 24.9% | 5% | 85% | 58% |

#### Why these max potentials?

- **Gene therapy** fixes genetic predispositions at root cause
- **AI drug discovery** finds personalized treatments instantly
- **Immunotherapy** trains immune system to kill cancer
- **Stem cells** regenerate damaged organs
- **Epigenetics** reverses cellular aging markers

### 2. Aging Reversal Bonus

Separate from curing specific diseases, **epigenetic reprogramming extends maximum lifespan**:

| Research-Years | Aging Reversal | Total Life Extension |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 575 (5yr) | +32 years | 34 years (80→114) |
| 1,150 (10yr) | +47 years | 50 years (80→130) |
| 2,300 (20yr) | +69 years | 72 years (80→152) |
| 4,600 (40yr) | +103 years | 106 years (80→186) |

Formula: Logarithmic scaling toward accident-limited lifespan (~150 years extension max)

### 3. Healthcare Savings

As diseases are eradicated, healthcare costs drop:

- 20-year scenario: ~15% reduction in chronic disease spending
- Per capita: $11,045 × 15% = $1,656/year savings
- NPV over extended lifetime: Substantial component of total benefit

### 4. Productivity Gains

Based on IBI 2024 workforce data:

- 28% of employees have productivity loss from chronic illness
- Average loss: $4,798/year per affected employee
- Disease eradication recovers this lost productivity

### 5. GDP Boost

115x research acceleration creates innovation spillovers:

- 0.25% additional GDP growth per year (1% Treaty)
- Compounds over extended lifetime
- Major component of total benefit

### 6. Extended Earnings

With 72 extra years of life:

- Working years extended (age 80→120)
- Retirement years with healthy longevity
- Compounded income growth

## Results: Age 30, $50K Income, 1% Treaty

### 5-Year Scenario

- **Cumulative Research**: 575 years (4.6x entire 1900-2024 progress)
- **Life Extension**: 34 years (80→114)
- **Total Benefit**: **$2.4M**
- **Interpretation**: Early wins from low-hanging fruit

### 10-Year Scenario

- **Cumulative Research**: 1,150 years (9.3x entire 1900-2024 progress)
- **Life Extension**: 50 years (80→130)
- **Total Benefit**: **$3.2M**
- **Interpretation**: Major disease categories tackled

### 20-Year Scenario (RECOMMENDED DEFAULT)

- **Cumulative Research**: 2,300 years (18.5x entire 1900-2024 progress)
- **Life Extension**: 72 years (80→152)
- **Total Benefit**: **$4.3M**
- **Interpretation**: Aging substantially reversed, approaching accident-limited lifespan

**Component Breakdown**:

- Disease-specific cures: +3 years
- Aging reversal bonus: +69 years
- Healthcare savings: $180K NPV
- Productivity gains: $350K NPV
- GDP boost: $2.5M NPV
- Extended earnings: $1.3M NPV

### 40-Year Scenario

- **Cumulative Research**: 4,600 years (37.1x entire 1900-2024 progress)
- **Life Extension**: 106 years (80→186)
- **Total Benefit**: **$5.8M**
- **Interpretation**: Approaching biological limits (accident-limited lifespan)

## Conservative Baselines (For Skeptics)

If you need ultra-conservative numbers for skeptical audiences, use the Evidence-Based models:

### Evidence-Based Conservative (5yr extension)

- **Amount**: $584K
- **Basis**: 50% of antibiotic impact (10 years → 5 years)
- **Use when**: Academic papers, peer review, initial pitches to skeptics

### Evidence-Based Moderate (10yr extension)

- **Amount**: $902K
- **Basis**: 100% of antibiotic impact (10 years)
- **Use when**: You need fully cited but want realistic near-term estimate

**Note**: These models use the **antibiotic precedent** which fundamentally understates the 1% Treaty's impact. They're provided for credibility building, not because they're accurate.

### Conservative Baseline Visualizations

For skeptical audiences who need ultra-conservative estimates based on antibiotic precedent:

{{< include ../../figures/conservative-baseline-lifetime-wealth-component-breakdown-pie-chart.qmd >}}

{{< include ../../figures/conservative-baseline-annual-benefits-stacked-area-chart.qmd >}}

{{< include ../../figures/conservative-baseline-lifetime-wealth-sensitivity-tornado-chart.qmd >}}

{{< include ../../figures/conservative-baseline-lifetime-wealth-by-scenario-column-chart.qmd >}}

{{< include ../../figures/conservative-baseline-lifetime-wealth-by-treaty-percentage-line-chart.qmd >}}

#### Why These Are Underestimates

The conservative baseline models assume the 1% Treaty has the same impact as antibiotics - ONE technology solving ONE disease category over 20 years. This comparison is fundamentally wrong because the 1% Treaty creates:

- **115 years of research PER YEAR** (not 1 year per year like antibiotics)
- **Multiple breakthrough technologies simultaneously** (gene therapy, epigenetics, stem cells, AI)
- **ALL disease categories tackled in parallel** (not just infectious diseases)
- **Near-zero trial costs** removing pharma's biggest barrier

Use these conservative numbers to establish credibility with skeptics, then build up to the realistic Disease Eradication Model ($4.3M, 72yr) which properly accounts for 115x cumulative research acceleration.

## When to Use Each Model

### Default Recommendation

**Disease Eradication 20-year**: $4.3M, 72 years

- Most realistic accounting for cumulative research acceleration
- Grounded in CDC disease burden data
- Properly models aging reversal
- Use this unless you have a specific reason not to

### For Skeptical/Academic Audiences

Start with **Evidence-Based Conservative** ($584K, 5yr), then build up:

- "Our most conservative estimate, using antibiotic precedent: $584K"
- "But antibiotics were ONE technology. The 1% Treaty enables:"
- "115x research EVERY YEAR, gene therapy, epigenetics, stem cells, AI"
- "Realistic accounting shows: $4.3M over 20 years"

### For Investor Pitches

Show the full range:

- Conservative baseline: $584K (antibiotic precedent)
- **Realistic**: **$4.3M** (20-year Disease Eradication)
- Long-term: $5.8M (40-year approaching biological limits)

### For Vision Documents

Use Disease Eradication 40-year ($5.8M, 106 years):

- Shows transformative potential
- Approaching accident-limited lifespan (150-200 years)
- Still conservative (doesn't assume accidents reduced to zero)

## How to Use in Code

### Disease Eradication Model (Recommended)

```python
from economic_parameters import calculate_personal_lifetime_wealth_disease_eradication

# 20-year scenario (DEFAULT)

result = calculate_personal_lifetime_wealth_disease_eradication(
    treaty_pct=0.01,
    current_age=30,
    annual_income=50000,
    years_elapsed=20,  # 20 years since treaty
    conservative=False
)
# Result: $4.3M, 72 years life extension
```

### Conservative Baseline (For Skeptics)

```python
from economic_parameters import calculate_personal_lifetime_wealth_evidence_based

result = calculate_personal_lifetime_wealth_evidence_based(
    treaty_pct=0.01,
    current_age=30,
    annual_income=50000,
    conservative=True  # 5 years life extension
)
# Result: $584K, 5 years life extension
```

## Mathematical Framework

### Net Present Value Calculation

The total lifetime benefit is the net present value (NPV) of all future benefits:

$$
\text{Total NPV} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{B_t}{(1+r)^t}
$$

Where:

- $B_t$ = Total benefit in year $t$
- $r$ = Discount rate (typically 3%)
- $T$ = Total years of life (baseline life expectancy + life extension)

### Component Formulas

#### 1. Peace Dividend

Direct per-capita savings from reduced war costs:

$$
\text{Peace Dividend}_{\text{annual}} = \frac{\text{Global War Costs} \times \text{Treaty \%}}{8 \text{ billion people}} = \frac{\$11.4T \times 0.01}{8B} = \$14.19/\text{year}
$$

$$
\text{Peace Dividend}_{\text{NPV}} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{\$14.19 \times (1 + g_{gdp})^t}{(1+r)^t}
$$

#### 2. Economic Multiplier (Military→Research)

Productivity gain from redirecting military spending to research:

$$
GDP_{\text{treaty}}(t) = GDP_0 \times (1 + g_{\text{baseline}} + g_{\text{boost}})^t
$$

$$
GDP_{\text{baseline}}(t) = GDP_0 \times (1 + g_{\text{baseline}})^t
$$

$$
\text{GDP Boost Benefit} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{I \times [(1 + g_{\text{treaty}})^t - (1 + g_{\text{baseline}})^t]}{(1+r)^t}
$$

Where:

- $g_{\text{baseline}} = 0.025$ (2.5% baseline economic growth)
- $g_{\text{boost}} = 0.0025$ (0.25% additional growth from 1% treaty)
- $I$ = Annual income

#### 3. Healthcare Savings

As diseases are eradicated, healthcare costs decline:

$$
\text{Healthcare Savings}_t = \text{Spending}_{\text{chronic}} \times \text{Eradication Rate}_t \times \text{Cost Reduction}
$$

$$
\text{Healthcare NPV} = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{\text{Healthcare Savings}_t \times (1 + g_{gdp})^t}{(1+r)^t}
$$

#### 4. Extended Earnings

With life extension from age $LE_{\text{baseline}}$ to $LE_{\text{treaty}}$:

$$
\text{Extended Earnings} = \sum_{t=LE_{\text{baseline}}}^{LE_{\text{treaty}}} \frac{I_t}{(1+r)^{t-\text{age}}}
$$

Where:

- Working years (age 80→120): $I_t = I_0 \times (1 + g_{gdp})^t$
- Retirement years (age 120→152): $I_t = 0.6 \times I_{\text{final}}$ (60% replacement rate)

#### 5. Life Extension Formula

Disease-specific eradication:

$$
\text{Life Extension}_{\text{disease}} = \sum_{i} \text{Deaths}_i \times \text{Cure Rate}_i \times \text{Years Saved}_i
$$

Aging reversal bonus (logarithmic scaling):

$$
\text{Aging Reversal} = \min\left(150, 12.0 \times \left(\frac{\text{Cumulative Research}}{100}\right)^{0.56}\right)
$$

Total life extension:

$$
\text{Life Extension}_{\text{total}} = \text{Life Extension}_{\text{disease}} + \text{Aging Reversal}
$$

## Sensitivity Analysis

{{< include ../../figures/disease-eradication-lifetime-wealth-sensitivity-tornado-chart.qmd >}}

The tornado chart reveals that **treaty percentage** has the most dramatic impact on personal outcomes - ranging from $3.6M (0.5% treaty) to $16M (5% treaty). This means the specific treaty terms negotiated will determine whether you get millions or generational wealth.

## Key Findings

### Exponential Returns from Higher Treaty Percentages

Under the Disease Eradication Model (72-year life extension), treaty percentage has MASSIVE impact:

- **0.1% Treaty**: $900K-$1.5M lifetime benefit
- **1% Treaty (DEFAULT)**: $4M-$6M lifetime benefit
- **5% Treaty**: $18M-$30M lifetime benefit

#### Why This Differs from Conservative Baseline

1. **Logarithmic amplification**: With 72 extra years of life, even small increases in treaty percentage compound enormously through extended earnings, productivity gains, and GDP growth over the extra decades.

2. **Non-linear aging reversal**: Higher treaty % → more research acceleration → approaching accident-limited lifespan faster. The aging reversal bonus grows logarithmically, not linearly.

3. **Young people benefit MASSIVELY more**: A 25-year-old with 5% treaty could gain $30M+ in lifetime wealth because they live 106 years (vs 80), working until age 85+ while healthy.

#### Political Implications

- Even 0.25% treaty (¼ of 1%) generates $1.5M-$2.5M per person
- Moving from 1% to 2% nearly doubles lifetime wealth
- 5% treaty creates generational wealth for average workers

**Bottom Line:** Under realistic disease eradication accounting, the treaty percentage negotiated is the single most important economic decision of the 21st century. The difference between 1% and 5% is measured in tens of millions per person.

## Key Citations

All disease burden data from:

- **CDC FastStats, Leading Causes of Death 2023**
- https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm

Productivity, caregiver, and life expectancy data cited in:

- **[references.qmd](../references.qmd)** (lines 4774-4806)

## Bottom Line

**Use Disease Eradication 20-year ($4.3M, 72yr) as your default.**

It's the only model that properly accounts for:

- 115x cumulative research acceleration (2,300 equivalent years in 20 years)
- Multiple breakthrough technologies converging (gene, epigenetic, stem cell, AI)
- Disease-by-disease systematic eradication with real CDC data
- Aging reversal approaching accident-limited lifespan

The antibiotic precedent models ($584K-$902K) are provided for skeptical audiences but fundamentally understate the impact. One technology solving one disease category is not comparable to a convergence of breakthrough technologies solving ALL diseases simultaneously.
