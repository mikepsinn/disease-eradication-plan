*Phase 0: Building Your Revolutionary Database Before You Have Anything to Revolution With*

Here's how you build a list of humans willing to fight death before you have the weapons to fight with. This is Phase 0—the part where you pretend you're organized while frantically building the plane mid-flight. Think of it as a Kickstarter for not dying, except instead of a shitty smartwatch, backers get to potentially live forever.

The goal isn't to collect money yet (you don't have the legal structure for that without going to prison). The goal is to identify and catalog every human who's tired of the whole "inevitable death" thing. You're building a database of the not-yet-dead who want to stay that way.

## The Current Clusterfuck

*Why Your Website Is Lying to People*

Right now your propaganda says "Donate" and "Buy VICTORY Bonds"—two things that are literally impossible because:

1. You don't have a 501(c)(3) yet (donations would be taxable gifts)
2. You haven't registered securities (the SEC has opinions about that)
3. You don't have a bank account (minor detail)

You're asking people to give you money through a slot that doesn't exist. It's like putting up a "Free Pizza" sign when you don't have pizza, an oven, or even flour. People show up excited, then leave confused and slightly angry.

Every day this continues, you lose potential revolutionaries who clicked, got confused, and went back to scrolling cat videos. These are people who were literally ready to throw money at the "not dying" problem, and you sent them away empty-handed.

## The Weapon: Airtable

*How to Build a Revolution Database for Free (Because You're Broke)*

You use Airtable because:

- **It's free** (you have no money)
- **It's simple** (you have no time)
- **It scales** (from 10 to 10 million records)
- **It has forms** (prettier than Google Forms)
- **It's not Excel** (we're not barbarians)

Think of Airtable as the gateway drug to professional database management. It's training wheels for your future command-and-control system that will coordinate 8 billion humans in the war against their own mortality.

## The Three-Division Army Structure

*How to Categorize Your Cannon Fodder*

You create three categories of future revolutionaries, because humans need labels to understand their purpose:

### Division 1: Financial Infantry (The Money People)

These are the capitalists who smell 271.8% returns and start salivating. They have money, they want more money, and they're willing to bet on humanity not going extinct to get it.

#### How to identify them

- They ask about ROI before asking about the mission
- Their LinkedIn has more than 500+ connections
- They use phrases like "deploy capital" instead of "spend money"
- They own Tesla stock but complain about Elon on Twitter

### Division 2: Home Front Supporters (The Feels People)

These are the bleeding hearts who cry at pharmaceutical commercials. They have feelings, they want to help, and they'll donate $20 they can't afford because a child has cancer somewhere.

#### How to identify them

- They share every charity post on Facebook
- They have strong opinions about healthcare despite knowing nothing about it  
- They own at least three "awareness" ribbons
- They think essential oils might actually work but they're "keeping an open mind"

### Division 3: Allied Command (The Institution People)

These are the organizations pretending to solve problems while perpetuating them. They have infrastructure, they want good PR, and they'll partner with anyone who makes them look innovative.

#### How to identify them

- They have "impact" or "innovation" in their name
- Their website has stock photos of diverse people looking at tablets
- They spend more on their annual gala than their actual mission
- Their CEO makes 500X what their program coordinators make

## The Enlistment Forms

*How to Harvest Data Without Being Creepy (Too Creepy)*

You create three different forms, each psychologically optimized for its target audience:

### Financial Infantry Enlistment Form

```
Title: "Reserve Your VICTORY Bonds (Before We Run Out)"

Fields:

- Full Name (what the IRS knows you as)
- Email (where we send your fortune)

  □ $25K-$100K (serious but cautious)

- [ ] Yes, add us to your newsletter we won't read
```

## The Deployment Strategy

*How to Replace Lies With Different Lies*

Here's how you fix your website's false advertising:

### Step 1: Delete the Impossible Buttons

Remove "Donate" and "Buy VICTORY Bonds" immediately. You're not a charity and you're not selling securities. Stop pretending.

### Step 2: Install the New Propaganda

Replace with:

- **"Reserve Your Bonds"** → Financial Infantry Form (the greed button)
- **"Join the Revolution"** → Home Front Form (the feelings button)  
- **"Partner With Us"** → Allied Command Form (the PR button)

### Step 3: Create Artificial Urgency

Add counters everywhere:

- "7,234 spots remaining in first allocation"
- "Join 142,337 revolutionaries"
- "Applications close in 47:23:16"

All lies, but effective lies.

### Step 4: A/B Test Everything

Because science:

- Test "End Death" vs "Cure Disease" (death wins)
- Test "271.8% Returns" vs "Save Humanity" (money wins)
- Test fear vs hope (fear wins, unfortunately)

## The Management Protocol

*How to Pretend You're Organized*

Once people start signing up, here's how you handle the flood:

### Weekly Reviews (Monday Morning Triage)

1. **New signups:** Categorize by delusion level
2. **High-value targets:** Flag the rich ones
3. **Partnerships:** Identify who's actually useful
4. **Nutjobs:** Flag but don't delete (they're persistent)

### Tagging System (How to Remember Who Matters)

Create tags for:

- **Whale:** Can fund everything
- **Dolphin:** Can fund something
- **Minnow:** Can fund nothing but tries
- **Influencer:** Loud on social media
- **Connected:** Knows important people
- **Crazy But Rich:** Self-explanatory
- **Crazy But Poor:** Avoid

### Follow-Up Sequences (Automated Harassment)

**Week 1:** "Welcome to the revolution" (hope and dreams)
**Week 2:** "Here's what we're building" (vague promises)
**Week 4:** "First victories" (made-up milestones)
**Week 8:** "The movement grows" (cherry-picked stats)
**Week 16:** "Ready to invest?" (the ask)

## The Communication Strategy

*How to Keep People Engaged Without Actually Doing Anything*

Send weekly "Battlefield Reports" containing:

- Made-up statistics that sound impressive
- Quotes from famous people taken out of context
- Progress bars that always go up
- Testimonials from "supporters" (you wrote them)
- Urgent calls to action that aren't actually urgent

Example subject lines:

- "We're 72% closer to ending death"
- "Elon Musk said something (unrelated but still)"
- "Your spot in history is waiting"
- "Last chance (until next week's last chance)"

## The Privacy Theater

*How to Pretend You Care About Their Data*

Add checkboxes that nobody reads:

- [ ] I agree to terms (War and Peace in legalese)
- [ ] I understand risks (you don't)
- [ ] I consent to cookies (the digital kind)
- [ ] I want updates (spam me daddy)

Include a privacy policy that says:

- We protect your data (until we don't)
- We never sell information (we give it away)
- We use industry standards (from 1995)
- You can unsubscribe anytime (good luck with that)

## The Metrics That Matter

*Numbers to Obsess Over*

Track everything:

- **Conversion rate:** How many visitors become revolutionaries
- **Email open rate:** Who's still paying attention
- **Geographic distribution:** Where hope lives
- **Wealth indicators:** LinkedIn profiles, email domains, zip codes
- **Engagement decay:** How fast people stop caring
- **Viral coefficient:** How many people each person recruits

## The Endgame

*What Success Looks Like*

By the end of Phase 0, you have:

- **100,000+ emails** (your army)
- **1,000+ qualified investors** (your war chest)
- **100+ organizations** (your infrastructure)
- **$1B in "intended" investments** (IOUs for the revolution)

This database becomes your proof of demand when you:

- Apply for 501(c)(3) status (look, we have supporters!)
- Register securities (look, we have buyers!)
- Approach politicians (look, we have voters!)
- Launch the actual platform (look, we have users!)

## Your Marching Orders

*The Five Steps to Start Right Now*

1. **Set up Airtable** (it takes 5 minutes, you have no excuse)
2. **Create the three forms** (copy-paste from above)
3. **Replace your lying website buttons** (stop the bleeding)
4. **Start collecting humans** (they're everywhere)
5. **Send weekly propaganda** (keep the dream alive)

Remember: You're not building a mailing list. You're building an army of humans who've decided that dying is stupid and they're ready to do something about it. Every email is a future soldier in the war against death. Every signup is a vote against the status quo of inevitable mortality.

The military-industrial complex has tanks and missiles. You have a spreadsheet and a dream. History shows that's usually enough.

Now stop reading and start recruiting. Death is signing up its own army, and it has a head start of about 300,000 years.
