# Quarto executes from project root (execute-dir: project in _book.yml)

This is the world that becomes possible through the 1% Treaty.
It is the future that opens up the moment humanity decides that investing in human potential is more profitable than investing in human destruction.

The 1% Treaty is not the endgame.
It is the **spark** for a new human trajectory.
It is the first turn of a great ratchet that will systematically shift our civilization from a zero-sum game of conflict to a positive-sum game of creation.

## Long-Term End State: A World Without War and Disease

Fifty years from now, your kid gets diagnosed with some rare genetic disease.
Instead of bankruptcy and death, here's what happens:

The doctor sequences her DNA, finds the problem, and designs a treatment.
It gets made at the local pharmacy.
The whole thing costs you nothing because the research was funded by the $27.2B health budget we redirected from buying bombs.

Cancer becomes treatable, like strep throat is now.
Alzheimer's gets cured.
Heart disease becomes optional.
You live as long as you want to live, and you stay healthy while you do it.

Your great-grandkids will read about people dying of cancer the way you read about people dying of polio.
It will seem primitive and tragic and completely unnecessary.

That's what happens when we stop wasting money on bombs and start spending it on not dying.

---

## What Happens Next: From 1% to Everything

The 1% Treaty is just the beginning.

When the first 1% works so well that cancer gets cured and people stop dying of preventable diseases, everyone's going to want more.
Citizens will vote for it.
Politicians will support it because their voters demand it.

Once the evidence proves that spending money on cures instead of bombs actually works, the next referendum won't be about whether to continue.
It'll be about how fast to redirect the rest.

### 2030: The 1% Treaty

Your kid gets cured of genetic diseases in a day.
Cancer becomes treatable.
You live longer and stay healthy.
$270 billion per year buys a lot of medical research.

### 2035: The 2% Treaty

We figure out aging.
You can stay 25 if you want, or age to whatever feels right.
Death from old age becomes optional.

### 2045: The 5% Treaty

We figure out depression and anxiety.
Mental health becomes a solved problem.
People are happier.
$675 billion per year focused on brain research works.

### 2055: The 20% Treaty

We get much smarter through safe brain enhancement.
We also solve climate change, poverty, and hunger with [\$2.72 trillion per year](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending).
These problems are mostly about money and focus, both of which we now have.

### 2065: The 50% Treaty

More people, living in space, with abundant clean energy.
War, disease, poverty, hunger, and climate change become historical problems, like smallpox.

### 2075: The 100% Treaty

The last military budget gets redirected.
Violence becomes as rare as cannibalism, not because it's forbidden, but because nobody wants to do it anymore.
We explore space instead of killing each other.

This is the **Great Ratchet**.
Each turn of the wheel locks in the gains and makes the next turn easier.
The strategy systematically and voluntarily phases out the global war economy, not through protest, but by offering a demonstrably superior investment vehicle for solving every major challenge facing humanity.

## A Civilization Reborn: The Economics of Abundance

What happens to a world that no longer bears the twin burdens of disease and war?
It becomes a civilization where every major human challenge has been solved.

The **median wealth** of a citizen in this new world is unimaginable by today's standards.
Consider the economic chains this system will break:

- **Healthcare costs approach zero.**
  With aging reversed and all diseases cured, the multi-trillion dollar deadweight loss of the "sick care" industry is eliminated and repurposed for creation.
- **The $16.4T annual cost of conflict is repurposed.**
  This capital, once wasted on destruction, is now invested in clean energy infrastructure, space habitats, consciousness enhancement, and artistic expression.
- **Human capital becomes infinite.**
  A world where every person can choose their biological age, control their mental state, and augment their intelligence is a world where human potential is truly limitless.

But the transformation goes far beyond individual enhancement.
When superintelligent minds tackle collective challenges, the impossible becomes inevitable:

- **Climate change is reversed.**
  Massive investments in fusion energy, carbon capture, and geoengineering have not just halted warming but begun restoring pre-industrial climate patterns.
- **Poverty is extinct.**
  Post-scarcity manufacturing and energy abundance have made basic necessities, food, shelter, education, healthcare, freely available to every person on Earth.
- **Hunger is eliminated.**
  Advanced agriculture, lab-grown foods, and precision resource distribution ensure that no human ever lacks nutrition.
- **Space becomes home.**
  Self-sustaining colonies throughout the solar system provide unlimited room for a growing, ageless population to explore and create.

In this economy of true abundance, the Three Supers are not sci-fi dreams, they are the industrial output of a civilization that has aligned its resources with its grandest possibilities:

- **Superlongevity:** You choose your lifespan.
  Death from aging becomes as obsolete as death from smallpox.
  Humanity's planning horizon extends from decades to millennia.
- **Superhappiness:** We master the biological mechanisms of consciousness itself.
  Depression, anxiety, and suffering become treatable conditions.
  The default human experience becomes profound well-being, creativity, and joy.
- **Superintelligence:** A global population of trillions of ageless, blissful minds, each augmented by AI, can direct collective intelligence toward the universe's deepest mysteries, and solve them.

This is not about becoming post-human; it's about becoming **fully human** for the first time.
It's about a species finally free to explore its unlimited potential without the constraints of scarcity, conflict, disease, or death.

## The Economics of Transcendence: By the Numbers

These transformations are not wishful thinking, they are the mathematically inevitable result of redirecting humanity's resources toward creation rather than destruction.

**The Current Misallocation:**

- **Global military spending:** [\$2.72 trillion annually](../references.qmd#global-military-spending-2-44t) (2024)
- **Global medical research:** [\$67.5 billion annually](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd)
- **Disparity ratio:** 40:1 in favor of weapons over cures

**The Peace Dividend Unlocked:**

- **Total annual cost of violence:** [$16.4T](peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) (10.9% of global GDP)
- **Value captured by 1% Treaty:** [\$27+ billion annually](peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)
- **Value returned to society:** [\$16.47 trillion annually](peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) (99.84% of total)
- **Per person impact:** \$74,259 saved over lifetime vs. current costs of conflict

**Individual Wealth Transformation:**

- **Current median household wealth:** ~\$100,000
- **2055 projected median wealth:** Millions (from eliminated healthcare costs, conflict reduction, and productivity gains)
- **Projected per capita benefit:** ~\$1.2M over 80 years from AI-driven health efficiencies
- **Healthcare cost savings:** \$4.5 trillion annually (US alone) approaching zero
- **Global disease burden savings:** ~\$9.76 trillion annually from a 50.0% reduction
- **Energy costs:** Approaching zero through fusion and space-based solar
- **Manufacturing costs:** Approaching zero through automation and asteroid mining

**Research and Development Acceleration:**

- **Current dFDA ROI:** [463:1 over 10 years](dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)
- **Annual R&D savings potential:** [$50.0B](dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) from efficiency gains
- **Health outcomes:** [840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years](dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) gained annually

This is the endgame.
It's about building the economic foundation for a civilization that stops funding its own destruction.
The numbers prove it works.
