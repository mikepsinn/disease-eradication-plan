## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line**: The 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA Infrastructure is a **dominant health intervention** that saves society **$5.87 million per life saved** (ICER = -$167,771 per QALY).

This means for every life saved, society becomes **$5.87 million richer** instead of paying the [$3,500-$5,500 cost of top charitable interventions](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved).

**How is this possible?** This initiative generates massive economic value ($147.1B annually) while also saving lives (875,000 QALYs annually), making it profitable for society to implement.

## Complete Calculation Walkthrough

### Step 1: Annual Economic Benefits

#### 1a. Peace Dividend ($97.1B/year)

**Source**: [Peace Dividend Analysis](../appendix/peace-dividend-analysis.qmd)

From [Cost of War Analysis](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd):

- **Total annual cost of war**: [$9,719B](../references.qmd#total-military-and-war-costs-9-7t)
  - Direct costs: $6,209B (military spending, infrastructure damage, human casualties, trade disruption)
  - Indirect costs: $3,510B (lost growth, veteran care, refugees, environmental damage)

**1% reduction in total war costs**:

- Societal dividend: $9,719B × 0.01 = **$97.1B annually**

**What this represents**:

- Less infrastructure destruction
- Reduced military spending
- Fewer economic disruptions
- Lower healthcare costs for war injuries
- Reduced refugee support costs

#### 1b. dFDA R&D Savings ($50B/year)

**Source**: [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)

From dFDA analysis:

- **Global clinical trial market**: [~$100B/year](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-spending)
- **Baseline cost reduction**: 50% (conservative estimate)
- **Mechanism**: Decentralized trials modeled on Oxford RECOVERY trial
  - Traditional Phase III: $40,000-$120,000 per patient
  - dFDA model: $500-$1,000 per patient (80-100× reduction)
- **Annual R&D savings**: $100B × 0.50 = **$50B annually**

**Sensitivity range**: $25B (25% reduction) to $95B (95% reduction in optimal scenarios)

#### Total Annual Economic Benefits

**$97.1B + $50B = $147.1 billion/year**

**Sensitivity range**: $122.1B to $192.2B (conservative to optimistic scenarios)

### Step 2: Annual Health Benefits (QALYs)

#### 2a. Peace Dividend Health Benefits (35,000 QALYs/year)

**Source**: [Cost of War Analysis](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd#death-accounting)

**Annual conflict deaths**: 100,000 people/year

- Active combat: 89,000 ([ACLED data](https://acleddata.com/))
- Terror attacks: 8,300 ([Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/))
- State violence: 2,700 ([Uppsala Conflict Data Program](https://ucdp.uu.se/))

**1% reduction in conflict**:

- Lives saved: 100,000 × 0.01 = **1,000 lives/year**

**Converting to QALYs**:

- Standard assumption: 1 life saved = 35 QALYs ([WHO life tables](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy))
- Rationale: Average age of conflict death ~30 years, life expectancy ~65 years = 35 years of life
- QALYs from peace dividend: 1,000 × 35 = **35,000 QALYs/year**

**Sensitivity range**: 500-1,500 lives saved = 17,500-52,500 QALYs

#### 2b. dFDA Health Benefits (840,000 QALYs/year)

**Source**: [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model)

**Baseline projection**: 840,000 QALYs/year from:

1. **Faster drug access** (50% of total): 420,000 QALYs
   - Average 2-3 year reduction in time to market
   - Applied to ~50 new drugs/year reaching market faster

2. **New therapies enabled** (30% of total): 252,000 QALYs
   - Rare diseases now economically viable
   - Unpatentable treatments tested
   - Repurposed drugs

3. **Prevention via real-world data** (20% of total): 168,000 QALYs
   - Early detection of drug interactions
   - Personalized medicine insights
   - Population health monitoring

**Sensitivity range**: 420,000 (conservative) to 2,100,000 (optimistic) QALYs

See [Appendix: Detailed QALY Calculation Model](dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model) for complete methodology.

#### Total Annual Health Benefits

**35,000 + 840,000 = 875,000 QALYs/year**

**Sensitivity range**: 437,500 (low) to 2,152,500 (high) QALYs

---

### Step 3: Annual Costs

#### 3a. Campaign Costs ($200M/year, amortized)

**Source**: [Campaign Budget](../economics/campaign-budget.qmd)

**Total campaign budget**: $1B over 3-5 years

- Viral referendum: $200M
- AI-assisted lobbying: $250M
- Technology platform: $250M
- Legal & compliance: $100M
- Partnerships: $100M
- Operations: $50M
- Reserve: $50M

**Amortized annual cost**:

- Conservative (3 years): $1B ÷ 3 = $333M/year
- Central (4 years): $1B ÷ 4 = $250M/year
- Optimistic (5 years): $1B ÷ 5 = $200M/year

**Using central estimate**: **$250M/year**

**Note**: After initial 3-5 year campaign, these costs drop to near zero. We use amortized costs for a 10-year NPV analysis.

#### 3b. dFDA Operational Costs ($40M/year)

**Source**: [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#simplified-roi-scenario)

**Annual operational costs**: $40M/year

- Platform maintenance: $15M
- Staff (minimal, AI-assisted): $10M
- Infrastructure (cloud, security): $8M
- Regulatory coordination: $5M
- Community support: $2M

**Sensitivity range**: $30M (efficient) to $60M (expanded operations)

#### Total Annual Costs

**$250M + $40M = $290M/year**

**Sensitivity range**: $230M to $393M

### Step 3b: Alternative Cost Perspective - The Funding Mechanism

**Important Note**: The above calculation uses traditional health economics methodology, counting all upfront costs. However, the actual funding mechanism makes the true cost perspective more nuanced.

#### Understanding the Funding Flow

**The DIH Treasury Mechanism**:

1. **Countries redirect $27B/year** from military budgets to the DIH treasury
2. **The DIH treasury allocates**:
   - $2.7B/year → VICTORY bondholders (10% of redirected funds)
   - $24.3B/year → Medical research and operations
   - This $24.3B covers:
     - dFDA operations: $40M/year
     - Clinical trial subsidies: ~$10-20B/year
     - Other medical research: Remaining funds

**VICTORY Bond Financing**:

- **Investors provide**: $1B upfront (funds the campaign)
- **Investors receive**: $2.7B/year perpetually (270% annual return)
- **Payback period**: 4.4 months
- **Result**: Campaign is self-funding from investor perspective

#### Alternative Cost Framings

**Framing 1: Zero Upfront Cost (Investor-Funded)**

- Campaign cost: $0 (funded by VICTORY bond investors who get repaid)
- dFDA operations: $0 (funded by DIH treasury from redirected military spending)
- **Total cost to society: $0/year**
- **ICER = -$168,114 per QALY** (society pays nothing, gets everything)

**Framing 2: Opportunity Cost of Redirected Spending**

- Cost: $27B/year (redirected military spending)
- But this $27B is ALREADY COUNTED in the $97.1B peace dividend
- Net cost: $27B - $27B = $0
- **ICER = -$168,114 per QALY**

**Framing 3: Military Waste Conversion**

- Military spending has negative ROI (destroys value)
- Medical spending has positive ROI (creates value)
- We're converting waste into productive investment
- **True cost: Negative** (we're avoiding wasteful spending)
- **ICER = Undefined** (negative cost, positive QALYs)

#### Why We Use Conservative $290M/Year in Primary Analysis

**For credibility and conservative estimation**:

1. Health economics convention requires counting all costs
2. Someone must pay the $1B campaign cost initially (even if repaid)
3. Conservative estimates are more defensible to skeptics
4. This intervention is dominant even with costs included

**Key insight**: Even counting ALL costs conservatively, the ICER is -$167,771/QALY. Under more realistic framings where the campaign is self-funding, the true societal cost approaches $0, making the intervention infinitely cost-effective.

---

### Step 4: ICER Calculation

**ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio)** = (Costs - Benefits) / QALYs gained

#### 4a. Net Economic Impact

**Annual net benefit** = Benefits - Costs

- Benefits: $147.1B
- Costs: $0.29B
- **Net benefit: $146.8 billion/year**

**Society saves $146.8 billion while gaining 875,000 QALYs**

#### 4b. ICER per QALY

**ICER** = ($290M - $147.1B) / 875,000 QALYs

**ICER** = -$146,810M / 875,000

**ICER = -$167,771 per QALY**

**Interpretation**: For every QALY gained, society saves $167,771. This is a **dominant intervention** (saves money AND improves health).

#### 4c. Cost per Life Saved

**Cost per life** = ICER × QALYs per life

**Cost per life** = -$167,771 × 35 QALYs/life

**Cost per life = -$5,871,985 per life saved**

**Interpretation**: For every life saved, society saves $5.87 million.

## Comparison to Other Interventions

### [Top Charitable Interventions (GiveWell 2024)](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)

| Intervention | Cost per Life Saved | ICER (approx) |
|-------------|--------------------:|---------------:|
| **Helen Keller International** (Vitamin A) | $3,500 | $100/QALY |
| **New Incentives** (Vaccination incentives) | $4,500 | $129/QALY |
| **Against Malaria Foundation** (bed nets) | $5,500 | $157/QALY |

**Source**: [GiveWell 2024 Top Charities](https://www.givewell.org/how-much-does-it-cost-to-save-a-life/february-2024-version)

These are **excellent** interventions - among the best uses of charitable dollars. They cost society money but save lives very cost-effectively.

### 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA

| Intervention | Cost per Life Saved | ICER |
|-------------|--------------------:|------:|
| **1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA** | **-$5,871,985** | **-$167,771/QALY** |

This is a **dominant intervention** - it makes society richer while saving lives.

### The Difference

**Traditional charity model**: Society pays to save lives

- Excellent value ($3,500-$5,500 per life)
- Requires ongoing donations
- Costs money to implement

**1% Treaty model**: Society profits from saving lives

- Exceptional value (-$5.87M per life = society saves money)
- Self-funding from economic gains
- Generates wealth while improving health

**The multiplier**: The 1% Treaty is **~1,700× more cost-effective** than the best charities in the world.

### ICER Across Scenarios

| Scenario | Net Benefit | QALYs | ICER/QALY | Cost/Life |
|----------|------------:|------:|-----------:|----------:|
| **Conservative** | $74.6B | 437,500 | **-$170,514** | **-$5.97M** |
| **Central** | $146.8B | 875,000 | **-$167,771** | **-$5.87M** |
| **Optimistic** | $294.8B | 2,152,500 | **-$136,945** | **-$4.79M** |

**Key finding**: In ALL scenarios, the intervention is dominant (saves money while saving lives).

### Alternative ICER Calculations Based on Funding Perspective

| Perspective | Annual Cost | Annual Benefit | QALYs | ICER/QALY | Cost/Life | Notes |
|-------------|------------:|---------------:|------:|----------:|----------:|-------|
| **Conservative (All Costs)** | $290M | $147.1B | 875k | **-$167,771** | **-$5.87M** | Counts all upfront costs |
| **Investor-Funded** | $0 | $147.1B | 875k | **-$168,114** | **-$5.88M** | Campaign funded by VICTORY bonds |
| **Opportunity Cost** | $27B | $147.1B | 875k | **-$137,257** | **-$4.80M** | Counts redirected military spending |
| **Waste Conversion** | -$27B* | $147.1B | 875k | **Undefined** | **Undefined** | Military spending creates negative value |

*Military spending has negative ROI (destroys value), so redirecting it is a benefit, not a cost.

**Interpretation**:

- Under traditional health economics (Conservative), the ICER is -$167,771/QALY
- Under realistic funding (Investor-Funded), society pays $0, ICER approaches -∞
- Considering opportunity cost of military spending, ICER is -$137,257/QALY
- Recognizing military spending as waste, the intervention has undefined (infinite) cost-effectiveness

**Worst case** (conservative): Society still saves $5.97M per life saved

**Best case** (optimistic): Society saves $4.79M per life saved (lower because we're saving many more lives, so the economic benefit is spread across more QALYs)

## Visual Comparisons

### Cost-Effectiveness: How Much Does Society Pay to Save a Life?

{{< include ../../../brain/figures/philanthropic-cost-effectiveness-comparison-bar-chart.qmd >}}

This chart demonstrates the fundamental difference between traditional philanthropy and the 1% Treaty approach:

- **GiveWell Top Charities** (Helen Keller International, New Incentives, Against Malaria Foundation): Society pays $3,500-$5,500 per life saved. These are excellent interventions—among the most cost-effective charitable uses of money in the world.

- **1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA**: Society SAVES $5.87 million per life saved. This is a dominant intervention that generates wealth while saving lives. The stacked bar shows contributions from both the peace dividend (1% less conflict) and dFDA R&D savings.

The dramatic scale difference illustrates why this intervention is ~1,700× more cost-effective than even the best traditional charities.

### Scale of Impact: Annual Economic Benefits

{{< include ../../../brain/figures/health-programs-vs-1-percent-treaty-societal-benefits-bar-chart.qmd >}}

This chart compares the gross annual economic benefits across major public health interventions:

- **Traditional interventions** (Water Fluoridation, Smoking Cessation, Childhood Vaccinations): Generate $0.8B to $15B in annual economic benefits. These are highly successful programs that have transformed public health.

- **1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA**: Generates $147.1B in annual economic benefits ($97.1B peace dividend + $50B dFDA R&D savings). This is nearly 10× larger than childhood vaccinations, one of the most successful interventions in history.

**Key distinction**: Only the 1% Treaty is self-funding—it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself while traditional interventions require ongoing funding.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How can this save money while saving lives?

**A**: The 1% Treaty generates $147.1B in annual economic benefits:

- $97.1B from reduced conflict costs (peace dividend)
- $50B from more efficient medical R&D (dFDA)

These benefits far exceed the $290M annual costs, creating a net profit of $146.8B/year for society.

Meanwhile, the same initiative saves lives:

- 1,000 lives from 1% less conflict
- 840,000 QALYs from faster/better medical treatments

You get **both** the economic benefit **and** the health benefit.

### Q: Why isn't everyone doing this already?

**A**: Market failure and collective action problem:

- Individual countries can't capture the global benefits
- Defense contractors profit from the status quo
- No mechanism exists to coordinate global action
- Medical research funding is fragmented across countries

The 1% Treaty solves this by creating aligned incentives.

### Q: What's the catch?

**A**: The main challenges are **political, not economic**:

- Getting countries to sign the treaty (hence the $1B campaign)
- Overcoming defense industry opposition (hence VICTORY bonds to co-opt them)
- Building the dFDA infrastructure (hence the $250M technology budget)

The math works. The challenge is execution.

### Q: How confident are you in these numbers?

**A**: Central estimates are conservative:

- Peace dividend uses 1% (could be 2-5% over time)
- dFDA uses 50% R&D savings (Oxford RECOVERY showed 80-100×)
- Excludes many hard-to-quantify benefits (innovation, rare diseases, etc.)

**Even in worst-case scenarios** (conservative column), the ICER is still -$170,514/QALY.

The intervention is **robustly dominant** across all reasonable parameter ranges.

### Q: Is it misleading to say society pays $0 when the campaign is investor-funded?

**A**: This depends on perspective:

**From society's aggregate perspective**: The $1B campaign cost is real money that someone must provide initially. However, since investors get repaid with 270% returns from redirected military spending, the net cost to society approaches $0 after payback.

**From taxpayers' perspective**: They give up $27B in military spending but receive $147.1B in economic benefits (peace dividend + R&D savings). Net gain: $120.1B.

**From investors' perspective**: They invest $1B and receive $2.7B/year perpetually. This is the best investment in history.

**The key insight**: Traditional ICER assumes spending society's resources on health interventions. Here, we're redirecting resources from **destructive uses** (war) to **productive uses** (medical research). The "cost" is really just stopping waste.

### Q: Isn't redirecting military spending politically impossible?

**A**: That's what the $1B campaign budget is for - making the politically impossible become inevitable through:

- Viral referendum showing overwhelming public support (80%+ want less war, more cures)
- VICTORY bonds that make supporting the treaty more profitable than opposing it
- AI-assisted lobbying that's 60-80% more cost-effective than traditional campaigns
- Creating unstoppable momentum in pilot countries first

The math shows it's worth trying. Even a 10% chance of success has positive expected value given the enormous returns.
