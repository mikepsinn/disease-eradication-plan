## Benefit Analysis Quantifying the Savings

This section quantifies the potential societal benefits of the dFDA Infrastructure, focusing primarily on R&D cost savings and health outcome improvements.

### Market Size and Impact

The global pharmaceutical and medical device R&D market is vast. Annual global spending on [clinical trials alone was estimated to be in the range of **USD 60-80 billion in 2024, and projected to exceed USD 100 billion by the early 2030s**](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-market-size). A significant portion of this expenditure is addressable by the efficiencies dFDA aims to introduce. If dFDA can capture even a fraction of this market by demonstrating superior efficiency and data quality, its economic impact will be substantial.

For this analysis, we use a conservative baseline estimate of [**`{python} format_billions(GLOBAL_CLINICAL_TRIAL_MARKET_ANNUAL)` per year in global clinical trial spending**](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-spending-dfda-baseline) that is potentially addressable by dFDA through decentralization, automation, and real-world data integration. This figure accounts for future market growth and the expanding scope of trials that could benefit from dFDA methodologies.

- **Current Average Costs**: Various estimates suggest [\$1.0 - \$2.5 billion to bring a new drug from discovery through FDA approval](../references.qmd#drug-development-cost), spread across ~10 years.
- **Clinical Trial Phase Breakdown**:
  - Phase I: \$2 - \$5 million/trial (smaller scale).
  - Phase II: \$10 - \$50 million/trial (depending on disease area).
  - Phase III: \$100 - \$500 million/trial (large patient populations).
- **Per-Patient Phase III Costs**: Often [\$40,000 - \$120,000+ per patient](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-cost-per-patient) (site fees, overhead, staff, monitoring, data management).

### Decentralized Trial Costs Modeled on Oxford RECOVERY

- **Oxford RECOVERY**: Achieved [**~\$500 per patient**](recovery-trial.qmd). Key strategies included:
  1. Embedding trial protocols within routine hospital care.
  2. Minimizing overhead by leveraging existing staff/resources and electronic data capture.
  3. Focused, pragmatic trial designs.

- **Extrapolation to New System**:
  - A well-integrated global platform could approach \$500 - \$1,000 per patient in many cases, especially for pragmatic or observational designs.
  - Up to **~80-100x+ cost reduction** cited for RECOVERY vs. typical Phase III trials is an aspirational benchmark, derived by comparing per-patient costs of [~\$500-\$1,000](#decentralized-trial-costs-modeled-on-oxford-recovery) against traditional costs of [~\$40,000 - \$120,000+](#market-size-and-impact).

### Overall Savings

1. **By Reducing Per-Patient Costs**

   - If a trial with 5,000 participants costs \$500 - \$1,000/patient, total cost is \$2.5 - \$5 million, versus \$200 - \$600 million under traditional models.
   - This magnitude of savings can drastically reduce the total cost of clinical development.

2. **Volume of Trials & Speed**

   - Faster, cheaper trials allow more drug candidates, off-label uses, nutraceuticals, and personalized dosing strategies to be tested.
   - Shorter development cycles reduce carrying costs and risk, further increasing ROI for sponsors.
   - Crowdsourced funding mechanisms, like those established by the [Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](../solution/dih.qmd), can further reduce patient costs and direct resources to high-value research.

3. **Regulatory Savings**

   - A single integrated platform with automated data audits cuts bureaucratic duplication across multiple countries, drastically lowering compliance costs.

4. **Accelerated Adoption through Legislative Mandates**

   - Provisions such as a "Right to Trial," as outlined in the ["Right to Trial and FDA Upgrade Act"](right-to-trial-fda-upgrade-act.qmd), would significantly accelerate the adoption and utilization of the dFDA Infrastructure. By guaranteeing patient access to trials via the platform, data generation, network effects, and the realization of cost savings would be expedited, further enhancing the overall benefits projected in this analysis.

5. **Increased Competition Among Sponsors Leading to Lower Submitted Trial Costs**

   - The transparent nature of the dFDA Infrastructure, coupled with mechanisms like NIH discount allocations based on value (QALYs per dollar as described in the "Right to Trial & FDA Upgrade Act"), is expected to create a competitive environment. Sponsors will be incentivized to submit the most efficient trial designs and leanest operational costs to the platform to attract NIH support and patient participation, further driving down the overall R&D expenditure beyond just the technical efficiencies of decentralized trials themselves.

### Drug Price Reductions from Global Competition and Importation

**U.S.-Specific**

- [U.S. prescription drug prices are 50–90% higher than in peer countries](../references.qmd#us-drug-prices-vs-peer-countries).
- Allowing importation and global competition could conservatively reduce U.S. drug spending by 20–50% for affected drugs.
- **Example Calculation:** [U.S. annual prescription drug spending](../references.qmd#us-drug-prices-vs-peer-countries) is ~\$360B. If 50% of the market is affected and prices drop by 25%, annual savings = \$360B × 0.5 × 0.25 = **\$45B**.

Beyond direct importation effects, the fundamental efficiencies introduced by the dFDA Infrastructure, drastically reduced R&D costs and accelerated development timelines, are anticipated to further enhance overall market competition for medicines. By lowering the barriers to entry for bringing novel therapies, as well as generics and biosimilars, to market, the dFDA can foster a richer landscape of therapeutic alternatives. A greater number of competing products for similar indications is a well-established economic driver for lower final drug prices, benefiting payors and patients alike. While quantifying this specific effect on end-user drug prices is complex and multifactorial, the structural changes proposed by the dFDA strongly support a trend towards increased affordability through enhanced market competition.

### Prevention Savings from Increased Preventive Care

**U.S.-Specific**

- [Chronic diseases account for ~90% of U.S. healthcare spending](../references.qmd#us-chronic-disease-spending) (~\$3.7T/year).
- Preventive care is underfunded (~5% of spend); [every \$1 spent on prevention saves ~\$3](../references.qmd#prevention-cost-savings-ratio).
- Doubling effective preventive spending could yield hundreds of billions in annual savings.
- **Example Calculation:** If preventive spending increases by $205B and each [\$1 saves $3](../references.qmd#prevention-cost-savings-ratio), additional savings = $205B × 3 = **\$615B/year**.

### Economic Value of Earlier Access to Treatments VSL QALY

- Faster approvals and access to effective treatments can save lives and improve quality of life.
- **Value of a Statistical Life (VSL):** [U.S. agencies use ~$10M per life saved](../references.qmd#vsl-value-statistical-life).
- **QALY Framework:** [Standard willingness-to-pay is **$100,000–$150,000 per QALY gained**](../references.qmd#qaly-value).
- **Example Calculation:** If faster access saves 10,000 QALYs/year, annual benefit = 10,000 × [$150,000](../references.qmd#qaly-value) = **\$1.5B**. If 10,000 lives are saved, benefit = 10,000 × [$10M](../references.qmd#vsl-value-statistical-life) = **\$100B**.
- These benefits are additive to direct cost savings and can be substantial depending on the scale of acceleration.

#### Gross R and D Savings from dFDA Implementation

- **Parameter**: Percentage reduction in addressable clinical trial costs due to dFDA.
- **Source/Rationale**:
  - [Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs) have demonstrated potential for significant cost reductions](../references.qmd#dct-cost-reductions-evidence) (20-`{python} format_percentage(TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_PCT)` or more) through reduced site management, travel, and streamlined data collection.
  - The [UK RECOVERY trial achieved cost reductions of ~80-98% per patient](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-cost-reduction) compared to traditional trials.
  - _Note on R&D Savings Estimates_: While specific trials like RECOVERY showcase transformative cost-saving potential (>95%), the average quantifiable cost reduction across the full spectrum of decentralized trials is an area of ongoing research and varies significantly based on trial complexity, therapeutic area, and the extent of decentralization. The scenarios below therefore present a range, with the "Transformative" scenario reflecting exceptional, RECOVERY-like outcomes.
- **Range Used in Sensitivity Analysis**:
  - Conservative: 30% (saving $30B annually from a [`{python} format_billions(GLOBAL_CLINICAL_TRIAL_MARKET_ANNUAL)` addressable spend](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-spending-dfda-baseline))
  - Base Case: **`{python} format_percentage(TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_PCT)` (saving `{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS_ANNUAL)` annually)** from a [`{python} format_billions(GLOBAL_CLINICAL_TRIAL_MARKET_ANNUAL)` addressable spend](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-spending-dfda-baseline)
  - Optimistic: 70% (saving $70B annually) from a [`{python} format_billions(GLOBAL_CLINICAL_TRIAL_MARKET_ANNUAL)` addressable spend](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-spending-dfda-baseline)
  - Transformative (RECOVERY Trial-like): 95% (saving $95B annually) from a [`{python} format_billions(GLOBAL_CLINICAL_TRIAL_MARKET_ANNUAL)` addressable spend](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-spending-dfda-baseline)
