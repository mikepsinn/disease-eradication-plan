This analysis quantifies the economic benefits derived from a 1% reduction in global military spending and the broader costs of conflict. The calculations are based on the data compiled in our [Cost of War analysis](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd).

We model two types of benefits:

1. **The Captured Dividend**: The direct funds redirected from military budgets to the DIH treasury.
2. **The Societal Dividend**: The total economic value retained by society due to a 1% reduction in all conflict-related costs.

## Military vs. Disease Research Funding

This chart shows the stark contrast between military spending and disease-specific research funding, highlighting the massive opportunity for reallocation.

## Sensitivity Analysis

A key principle of rigorous economic modeling is to test the assumptions to understand how they impact the final conclusions. A sensitivity analysis allows us to see how the "Societal Dividend" changes when we vary our key inputs.

In this analysis, we will vary two key parameters simultaneously:

1. **Reduction Percentage**: We will model a range of reductions from 0.5% to 2.0% to see the impact of partial or greater-than-expected success.
2. **Accuracy of Indirect Cost Estimates**: The indirect costs of war (like lost economic growth) are harder to quantify than direct spending. We will model a scenario where these costs might be overestimated or underestimated by 25%.

```{python}
# Define the ranges for the sensitivity analysis

reduction_percentages = [0.005, 0.01, 0.015, 0.02]
indirect_cost_multipliers = [0.75, 1.0, 1.25] # Represents -25%, baseline, +25%

# Create an empty list to store results

results = []

# Loop through each combination of parameters

for redux in reduction_percentages:
    for mult in indirect_cost_multipliers:
        
        # Recalculate total cost based on the multiplier for indirect costs
        adjusted_indirect_costs = total_indirect_costs * mult
        adjusted_total_cost = total_direct_costs + adjusted_indirect_costs
        
        # Calculate the societal dividend for this scenario
        dividend = adjusted_total_cost * redux
        
        # Store the result
        results.append({
            "Reduction %": f"{redux:.1%}",
            "Indirect Cost Scenario": f"{int((mult-1)*100)}%",
            "Societal Dividend ($B)": f"{dividend:,.1f}"
        })

# Create a pandas DataFrame for better display

df = pd.DataFrame(results)

# Pivot the table for a matrix-like view

pivot_df = df.pivot(index="Indirect Cost Scenario", columns="Reduction %", values="Societal Dividend ($B)")

print("--- Sensitivity Analysis: Societal Dividend ($ Billions) ---")
print(pivot_df)
```

## Key Findings

The peace dividend analysis reveals:

1. **Massive Scale**: Even a 1% reduction in conflict costs generates $114+ billion annually in societal benefits
2. **Two-Tier Benefits**:

   - **Captured Dividend**: $27.2B annually (direct military budget reallocation)
   - **Societal Dividend**: $113.6B annually (total economic benefits)
3. **Robust to Assumptions**: The sensitivity analysis shows the benefits remain substantial even under conservative scenarios
4. **Clear Opportunity**: The contrast with disease research funding ([$67.5B total](../references.qmd#global-gov-med-research-spending)) shows the massive potential for reallocation

This analysis provides the economic foundation for the 1% Treaty initiative, demonstrating that even modest reductions in conflict can generate substantial resources for medical research and other beneficial purposes.
