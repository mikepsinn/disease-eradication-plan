# Quarto executes from project root (execute-dir: project in _book.yml)

Goals:

- A global, autonomous regulatory network (not confined to a single government entity) that continuously collects data from real-world use and decentralized clinical trials.
- An open data architecture that aggregates anonymized health data from billions of people, covering foods, drugs, devices, supplements, and other interventions.
- Treatment rankings, continuously updated based on observational and randomized data, personalized by patient characteristics (e.g., genomics, comorbidities).

### Key Capabilities

- **Massive Decentralized Trials**: Patients anywhere can opt in to trials comparing multiple treatments, with automated randomization, data collection (via electronic health records, wearables, apps), and analytics.
- **Real-Time Surveillance**: Continuous data ingestion about side effects, efficacy, interactions with other drugs/foods, and long-term outcomes.
- **Reduced Administrative Overhead**: Blockchain or similar decentralized infrastructure for consent management, compensation, and data integrity could replace large swaths of current paperwork, monitoring, and site management costs.

### Potential Impact on the Status Quo

- **Speed of Trials**: Reduced overhead and automated data capture can compress timelines.
- **Cost of Trials**: Leveraging existing healthcare encounters, telemedicine, and EHR data to drastically cut per-patient costs (modeled on the Oxford RECOVERY trial success).
- **Scale & Scope**: Potential for testing many more drugs, off-label indications, unpatentable treatments, nutraceuticals, and personalized medicine approaches.
- **Innovation Incentives**: Lower R&D costs can increase profitability and encourage more entrants/innovation in the life sciences.
