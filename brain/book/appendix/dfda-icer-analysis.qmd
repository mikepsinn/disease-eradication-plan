### Cost Utility ICER QALY and Sensitivity Analysis

#### Introduction Why QALY and ICER

To meet the standards of government and health technology assessment (HTA) bodies such as ICER, we present a cost-utility analysis using the **incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)** and **quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)**. This approach is the US and global standard for evaluating the value of health interventions ([ICER](https://icer.org/our-approach/methods-process/cost-effectiveness-the-qaly-and-the-evlyg/)).

- **QALY**: One year of life in perfect health. Gains are calculated as:

  $$
  \text{QALYs Gained} = (Q_1 \times T_1) - (Q_0 \times T_0)
  $$

  Where $Q_0$/$Q_1$ = quality of life (0-1) before/after, $T_0$/$T_1$ = years of life before/after.

- **ICER**: The cost per QALY gained:

  $$
  \text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Incremental Cost}}{\text{Incremental QALYs}} = \frac{\text{Cost}_{\text{new}} - \text{Cost}_{\text{old}}}{\text{QALYs}_{\text{new}} - \text{QALYs}_{\text{old}}}
  $$

  If an intervention saves money (negative incremental cost) and improves health (positive QALY gain), the ICER will be negative, indicating a **dominant** (cost-saving) intervention.

- **US Willingness-to-Pay Threshold**: Typically $100,000–$150,000 per QALY for interventions that _add_ costs ([ICER Reference Case](https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reference-Case-4.3.25.pdf)). Dominant interventions are favorable regardless of this threshold.

- **Sources for Context:**
  - "The quality-adjusted life year (QALY) is the academic standard for measuring how well all different kinds of medical treatments lengthen and/or improve patients' lives..." ([ICER](https://icer.org/our-approach/methods-process/cost-effectiveness-the-qaly-and-the-evlyg/))
  - "ICER's health benefit price benchmark (HBPB) will continue to be reported using the standard range from $100,000 to $150,000 per QALY..." ([ICER Reference Case](https://icer.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Reference-Case-4.3.25.pdf))

#### Parameterization Overall dFDA Infrastructure Impact

The dFDA Infrastructure's primary economic impact comes from significantly reducing R&D costs. Its health impact, measured in Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), stems from three main pillars: accelerating drug development, enabling better prevention through real-world evidence, and facilitating research for previously untreatable conditions.

**A. Net Incremental Cost of dFDA Infrastructure (Annual):**

- Calculated as: `(Platform Operational Costs) - (Gross R and D Savings from dFDA)`
- **Baseline Assumptions for R&D Savings (same as before):**
  - Global Clinical Trial Spending Addressable by dFDA: **$100 Billion / year**.
  - R&D Trial Cost Reduction due to dFDA (Baseline): **50%**. (Leads to $50B Gross R and D Savings). _It's important to note that these projected R&D savings are achieved not only through the inherent technical and operational efficiencies of decentralized, platform-based trials, e.g., reduced site management, automated data capture, but also through the anticipated competitive pressures the transparent dFDA Infrastructure will place on sponsors to optimize trial designs and submit lean, competitive operational cost estimates._

- **Aggregate Annual QALYs Gained (ΔQALYs_total):** The number of QALYs generated annually by the dFDA Infrastructure is a composite metric derived from a detailed model in the appendix. The model provides a range of estimates based on the successful realization of the platform's potential.
- **Conservative Scenario:** 190,000 QALYs/year
- **Base Case Scenario:** 840,000 QALYs/year
- **Optimistic/Transformative Scenario:** 3,650,000 QALYs/year

For a complete breakdown of the assumptions, data sources (including NBER working papers by Glied & Lleras-Muney and Philipson et al.), and calculations behind these figures, please see the **[Appendix: Detailed QALY Calculation Model](#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model)**.

- **Platform Operational Cost Scenarios:** The sensitivity analysis below considers various scopes for the platform's operational costs, derived from the [Costs of Building and Operating the Global Decentralized FDA ROM Estimate](#costs-of-building-and-operating-the-global-decentralized-fda-rom-estimate) section.
- **Core Platform Ops (Midpoint):** $0.01875B ($18.75M) / year
- **Core Platform + Medium Broader Initiative:** $0.04B ($40M) / year
- **Illustrative Total Ecosystem (Low-Medium):** $0.5B ($500M) / year
- **Illustrative Total Ecosystem (High):** $5B / year

#### Sensitivity Analysis Overall dFDA Infrastructure Cost-Effectiveness

This table analyzes the ICER for the dFDA Infrastructure by varying key assumptions. Global Clinical Trial Spending Addressable by dFDA is assumed at $100B/year (leading to $50B gross savings in the 50% reduction scenario) unless otherwise specified.

_Note: Negative ICER values indicate that the dFDA Infrastructure is cost-saving while also improving health outcomes. "Platform Op. Cost" here refers to different scopes: "Core Platform Ops" is per the ['Annual Operational Costs'](#annual-operational-costs-illustrative-at-target-scale-of-5m-mau-50tb-ingest-month) ROM. Higher figures labeled "Total Ecosystem" are illustrative and aim to include broader initiative costs and/or large-scale participant compensation._

#### Discussion: Policy Implications

The analysis robustly demonstrates that the **dFDA Infrastructure is not merely cost-effective but is overwhelmingly a dominant (cost-saving) intervention across a wide range of plausible scenarios, especially when considering the core platform's technical operational costs.**

- **Massive Cost Savings & Extremely Favorable Core ICER**: The core dFDA Infrastructure (with operational costs of ~$19M-$40M/year as per the ['Costs of Building and Operating the Global Decentralized FDA ROM Estimate'](#costs-of-building-and-operating-the-global-decentralized-fda-rom-estimate) ROM) generates tens of billions in net annual R and D savings. This results in extremely negative ICERs (e.g., ~-$59,501 per QALY), indicating exceptional value.
- **Total Ecosystem Considerations**: Even when accounting for significantly broader ecosystem costs (e.g., hundreds of millions or even billions annually for extensive global rollout, governance, plugin development, and/or large-scale participant compensation), the dFDA initiative remains dominant and highly cost-saving, with strongly negative ICERs (e.g., -$19,041 to -$155,263 per QALY in various scenarios).

**Summary: The dFDA initiative is projected to be a dominant healthcare transformation. The core technology platform itself is exceptionally efficient (annual operational costs ~$19M-$40M per the ['Costs of Building and Operating the Global Decentralized FDA ROM Estimate'](#costs-of-building-and-operating-the-global-decentralized-fda-rom-estimate) ROM), leading to ICERs around -$59,476 per QALY. Even when considering broader illustrative total ecosystem costs (potentially $0.5B to $5B+ annually to include extensive global operations, participant compensation etc.), the initiative yields substantial net monetary savings (e.g., -$29.5B to -$94.5B annually in various scenarios) while simultaneously generating hundreds of thousands to millions of QALYs each year. The actual cost per QALY gained remains strongly negative across all these scopes, making it an exceptionally high-value proposition.**

*(Optional: A note could be added here that specific programs _built upon_ the dFDA Infrastructure, if they incur additional marginal costs, would then be evaluated for their own cost-effectiveness. However, they would benefit from the already cost-saving nature of the underlying dFDA infrastructure.)*
