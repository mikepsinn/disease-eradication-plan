## Grant Proposal: Establishing the Decentralized Institutes of Health

---

**Project Title:** DIH Phase 0: Foundation and Launch

**Applicant Organization:** [Name of Future DIH 501(c)(3) Entity]

**Funding Request:** \$900,000 (for 501(c)(3) activities only)

**Project Duration:** 12 Months

---

### Important Note for Private 501(c)(3) Foundation Funders

This grant proposal template outlines the *entirety* of the activities required to launch the DIH initiative, which involves three separate legal entities: a 501(c)(3) public charity, a 501(c)(4) social welfare organization, and a for-profit company.

**A private 501(c)(3) foundation can only legally fund the activities of the DIH 501(c)(3) entity.**

Under IRS regulations, grants from a private foundation must be used exclusively for charitable, educational, or scientific purposes. They **cannot** be used to:

* Fund lobbying activities (the primary purpose of the 501(c)(4)).
* Directly fund or subsidize a for-profit business, including its fundraising and development activities (the purpose of the for-profit company).

Therefore, a grant from your foundation must be made **specifically to the DIH 501(c)(3)** and be legally restricted to the permissible activities outlined below. The funding for the other entities must be sourced separately (e.g., through direct investment in the for-profit or non-deductible donations to the 501(c)(4)).

The deliverables in this proposal have been annotated to clarify which activities are permissible for a 501(c)(3) grant.

### 1. Executive Summary

The Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) initiative aims to fundamentally restructure the global medical research and development ecosystem. The current system is slow, expensive, and fails to address 95% of human diseases. By redirecting a mere 1% of global military spending, we can create a self-sustaining, decentralized, and radically efficient system for curing disease.

This proposal requests a \$900,000 seed grant to fund the 501(c)(3) charitable activities within "Phase 0" of the DIH roadmap. This foundational phase is designed to establish the educational and research infrastructure, recruit a core team for the nonprofit, and build the initial public technology platforms. This grant will not fund lobbying or for-profit activities, but rather the creation of the charitable engine that will drive the DIH mission forward. The key deliverable is a fully operational, legally compliant 501(c)(3) organization poised for exponential growth and self-sustaining fundraising within 12-18 months.

### 2. Problem Statement

Humanity spends \$2.7 trillion annually on military defense and only \$68 billion on medical research—a 40:1 ratio of funding destruction over creation. The existing medical research system, managed by centralized bodies like the NIH, is plagued by inefficiency:

* **Bureaucratic Bottlenecks:** Researchers spend up to 50% of their time writing grant proposals, with a 90% rejection rate.
* **Misaligned Incentives:** The system rewards publications and grant renewals, not patient outcomes or cures.
* **Extreme Costs:** FDA-regulated trials cost, on average, \$41,000 per patient, a figure proven to be over 80x higher than necessary by efficient models like the Oxford RECOVERY trial.

This systemic failure results in a massive loss of life and trillions in economic damage. The DIH is designed to solve this by creating a parallel system based on market principles, patient choice, and decentralized governance.

### 5. Evaluation & Metrics for Success

The success of this seed grant will be measured by the achievement of the deliverables listed in Section 3. The ultimate metric of success is the organization's readiness to execute a multi-hundred-million-dollar capital raise and begin full-scale platform development by the end of the 12-month grant period.

### 6. Sustainability Plan

This grant is designed to bridge the organization to a state of self-sustaining fundraising. The activities funded by this grant, particularly the development of the fundraising materials and the securing of initial commitments for the VICTORY Bonds, are explicitly designed to generate the revenue required for long-term operations. The successful completion of this Phase 0 will de-risk the project sufficiently to attract the large-scale investment needed to make the DIH a permanent fixture in the global health landscape.
