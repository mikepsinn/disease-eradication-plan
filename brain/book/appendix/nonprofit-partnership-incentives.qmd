# Non-Profit Partnership Incentive Model

This document outlines the strategic framework for aligning non-profit partners with the core mission of the 1% Treaty. It offers a solution to the limitations of traditional grantmaking, rooted in the project's core philosophy: **make contributing to the broader mission the most profitable and impactful activity for all stakeholders.**

## A New Model for Partnership

Traditional grantmaking, while essential, can sometimes create a dynamic where non-profits are forced to compete for a finite pool of resources. This can inadvertently lead to a focus on short-term organizational survival rather than long-term, collective impact.

We propose a new model that transforms the traditional grantor-grantee relationship into a true, performance-based partnership. Instead of competing for limited funds, our partners are given the tools to generate new value and are rewarded directly for their success in advancing a shared mission.

This model is designed to directly and transparently tie the financial success of our non-profit partners—both organizationally and personally—to their performance in achieving a collective goal.

## The Solution: A Mathematically Superior Partnership

We offer a two-part incentive structure that transforms partners from passive grant recipients into active, motivated stakeholders.

### 1. Organizational Incentive: Performance-Based Grants (The Multiplier)

This incentive aligns the organization's budget with our primary mobilization goal.

- **The Model:** A baseline grant is provided to establish the partnership. This is coupled with a substantial, performance-based multiplier.
- **The Offer (Example):**
  > "Your organization will receive a **baseline partnership grant** to cover initial setup and integration costs. In addition, we will release a **substantial performance grant** for every **X verified referendum votes** (e.g., 10,000) driven through your unique organizational link. This bonus is uncapped."

- **The Result:** The non-profit's most rational path to maximizing its budget is to become our most effective mobilization partner. Their team's efforts are now directly focused on a shared, measurable Key Performance Indicator (KPI): referendum votes.

### 2. Individual Incentive: Personal Stakeholder Grants (VOTE Points)

This incentive aligns the personal financial interests of key leaders with the ultimate success of the mission. This is critical to overcoming the natural tendency to simply use grants to increase internal salaries.

- **The Model:** We award a significant personal grant of **VOTE points** directly to the individual leaders (e.g., Executive Director, Head of Development) within the partner organization.
- **The Offer (Example):**
  > "For your leadership in this partnership, you will be personally granted a **significant allocation of VOTE points**. These points represent a future claim on the economic value of the **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)** and the DIH treasury you are helping to create."

- **The Result:** The leader's personal wealth is now directly tied to the treaty's success. They are no longer just an employee of a partner organization; they are a personal stakeholder in the entire endeavor. This creates a powerful incentive to drive for the larger outcome, far beyond their organization's immediate budget.

## The Ultimate Incentive: From Grant Applicant to Grant Maker

The short-term performance grants and personal VOTE points are merely the activation energy. The true, long-term prize for our non-profit partners is a permanent transformation of their role in the global health ecosystem.

Our model is designed to empower our coalition partners to become the governors of the very funding bodies that will define their fields for decades to come.

- **The Vision:** The **[Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](../solution/dih.qmd)** is designed as a "coalition of coalitions." The main `{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)`+ treasury will allocate multi-billion dollar budgets to specialized sub-DAOs (e.g., Decentralized Institute of Mental Health, Decentralized Institute on Aging).
- **The Prize:** Governance of these powerful, well-funded sub-DAOs will be granted to the coalition of non-profit partners who made the 1% Treaty a reality.
- **The Result:** By joining our coalition, you are not just helping to unlock a new pool of funding; you are earning a permanent and powerful governance stake in it. The choice is clear: continue competing for small, finite grants, or cooperate to collectively govern a multi-billion dollar annual treasury dedicated to your mission.

## Earning a Stake: Tracking Contributions for Treasury Allocation

To ensure fairness and reward meaningful contributions, we will implement a transparent system to track the value each partner brings to the coalition. A partner's governance stake and proportional share of their sub-Institute's treasury will be influenced by their verified contributions during the treaty ratification campaign.

Key performance indicators will include:

1.  **Direct Fundraising:** The total amount of funding a partner raises for the campaign through their unique referral links.
2.  **Referendum Mobilization:** The number of verified referendum votes a partner drives through their network.
3.  **In-Kind Contributions:** The value of non-monetary contributions, such as staff time, access to resources, or strategic support, will be formally assessed and credited.

This "contribute-to-earn" model ensures that the most dedicated and effective partners are rewarded with the greatest influence in the new, abundance-based system they helped create.

This is the endgame. We are offering our partners the opportunity to stop being grant applicants and become the grant-makers.

## Conclusion: From Partners to Stakeholders

This dual-incentive model transforms the traditional, often inefficient, grantor-grantee relationship into a true, performance-based partnership. By offering a mathematically superior path to both organizational funding and personal wealth creation, we make supporting the 1% Treaty the most logical and profitable choice for our non-profit partners and their leaders.
