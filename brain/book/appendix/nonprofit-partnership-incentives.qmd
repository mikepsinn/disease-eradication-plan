# On How to Bribe Nonprofits (The Legal Kind)

**The Problem With Traditional Grantmaking:**

Nonprofits spend most of their time begging for money. Foundations spend most of their time deciding who to give money to. Everyone pretends this is efficient.

It's not.

Traditional grantmaking creates a system where nonprofits compete for finite resources. This means they optimize for:
- Writing the best grant proposals
- Staying alive as organizations
- Not pissing off donors

They do not optimize for:
- Actually solving the problem
- Long-term collective impact
- Coordinating with other nonprofits

This is rational behavior. You can't change the world if you go bankrupt first.

**The Solution:**

Stop making them compete. Make cooperation more profitable than competition.

We offer a model that transforms the traditional "please give us money" relationship into "here's how we all get rich together by solving the problem."

Core philosophy: **Make contributing to the broader mission the most profitable activity for everyone involved.**

## On The Two-Part Bribe

We offer two incentives that transform nonprofits from "please fund us" to "let's get rich together."

### Part 1: Make The Organization Rich (Performance-Based Grants)

**The Old Way:**
"Here's $100K. Hope it helps. Submit a 47-page report in 6 months about impacts and learnings."

**The New Way:**
"Here's $50K baseline to get started. Plus $10K for every 10,000 verified referendum votes you drive. No cap."

**The Offer:**
> "Your organization receives a **baseline partnership grant** for setup costs. You also get a **substantial performance grant** for every **X verified referendum votes** (e.g., 10,000) driven through your unique link. This bonus is uncapped."

**What This Does:**

The nonprofit's most rational path to maximizing their budget is to become our most effective mobilization partner.

Not: Write better grant proposals
Not: Compete with other nonprofits
Not: Please the foundation

Just: Drive referendum votes.

One metric. No ambiguity. Get paid for results.

### Part 2: Make The Leaders Personally Rich (VOTE Points)

**The Problem Grants Don't Solve:**

Even performance grants can get absorbed into general operations. "We hired three more grant writers!"

This doesn't solve the problem. This creates more grant writers.

**The Solution:**

Give the leaders personal equity. Make them personally wealthy when the mission succeeds.

**The Offer:**
> "For your leadership in this partnership, you will be personally granted a **significant allocation of VOTE points**. These points represent a future claim on the **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)** and the DIH treasury you are helping to create."

**What This Does:**

The Executive Director's personal wealth is now tied to treaty success.

They're not just an employee anymore. They're a stakeholder. Their Tesla depends on it.

This creates an incentive to drive for the larger outcome, far beyond their organization's quarterly budget.

## On The Real Prize (Or: How to Stop Begging Forever)

The performance grants and VOTE points are just the appetizer.

The real prize is never having to write a grant proposal again.

**The Transformation:**

Our model is designed to turn grant applicants into the people who give out grants.

Stop begging. Start deciding.

**How It Works:**

The **[Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](../solution/dih.qmd)** is a "coalition of coalitions" with a `{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)` annual treasury.

This treasury allocates multi-billion dollar budgets to specialized sub-DAOs:
- Decentralized Institute of Mental Health
- Decentralized Institute on Aging
- Decentralized Institute of [Whatever Your Mission Is]

**Who Controls These Billions?**

The coalition of nonprofits who made the 1% Treaty happen.

You helped create it. You govern it.

**The Choice:**

**Option A:** Keep competing for finite grants. Write proposals forever. Beg foundations. Hope your competitor doesn't write a better proposal.

**Option B:** Join our coalition. Help pass the treaty. Collectively govern a multi-billion dollar annual treasury dedicated to your mission.

One of these options involves begging. The other involves being the person everyone begs to.

Choose wisely.

## Earning a Stake: Tracking Contributions for Treasury Allocation

To ensure fairness and reward meaningful contributions, we will implement a transparent system to track the value each partner brings to the coalition. A partner's governance stake and proportional share of their sub-Institute's treasury will be influenced by their verified contributions during the treaty ratification campaign.

Key performance indicators will include:

1.  **Direct Fundraising:** The total amount of funding a partner raises for the campaign through their unique referral links.
2.  **Referendum Mobilization:** The number of verified referendum votes a partner drives through their network.
3.  **In-Kind Contributions:** The value of non-monetary contributions, such as staff time, access to resources, or strategic support, will be formally assessed and credited.

This "contribute-to-earn" model ensures that the most dedicated and effective partners are rewarded with the greatest influence in the new, abundance-based system they helped create.

This is the endgame. We are offering our partners the opportunity to stop being grant applicants and become the grant-makers.

## Conclusion: From Partners to Stakeholders

This dual-incentive model transforms the traditional, often inefficient, grantor-grantee relationship into a true, performance-based partnership. By offering a mathematically superior path to both organizational funding and personal wealth creation, we make supporting the 1% Treaty the most logical and profitable choice for our non-profit partners and their leaders.
