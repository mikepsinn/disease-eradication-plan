The 1% Treaty is the engine of this revolution. It's a simple, legally-binding agreement with a single, powerful provision: every signatory nation agrees to redirect 1% of its annual military budget to the [Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](../solution/dih.qmd).

## The Simple, Brutal Math

1.  **The Problem:** The world spends [$2.7 trillion a year](../references.qmd#global-military-spending-2-44t) on military forces. This is done to maintain a delicate balance of power.
2.  **The Hack:** If every nation reduces its military spending by 1% *at the same time*, the balance of power remains identical. No country becomes more vulnerable.
3.  **The Prize:** That 1%—a **`{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)`-a-year river of cash**—is redirected to fund the cure for all human diseases.

## How It Works: A Self-Sustaining System

1.  **Funding:** The treaty creates a `{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)`/year revenue stream for the DIH, funded by the 1% military reallocation.
2.  **Execution:** The DIH uses this money to subsidize patient participation in the [dFDA](../solution/dfda.qmd), a system of hyper-efficient clinical trials that are **[80x cheaper](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-`{python} TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_FACTOR`x-cost-reduction)** than the current model.
3.  **Governance:** The DIH is not a bureaucracy. It's a [Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)](../solution/dih.qmd) governed by smart contracts and the votes of the global population via [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd).
4.  **Transparency:** All research, all data, and all spending are published on a public ledger for the world to see.

## It's Not a Sacrifice, It's a Trade

The 1% Treaty is not about charity or altruism. It's a simple, rational trade: give up 1% of our ability to kill each other in exchange for a system that can save everyone. It's the best deal in human history.
