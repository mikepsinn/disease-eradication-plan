### QALY Model Summary {#qaly-model-summary}

This model provides a transparent basis for the aggregate annual Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) generated by the dFDA Infrastructure. The total QALY gain is the sum of three distinct benefit streams, each presented with a conservative, base, and optimistic estimate.

#### A. Accelerating Development of Existing Pipeline Drugs

This stream quantifies the health gains from bringing effective treatments to patients faster. The dFDA Infrastructure is expected to shorten development and approval timelines significantly.

- **Rationale:** a one-year delay in the diffusion of new cancer therapies alone resulted in a loss of **84,000 life-years**. By reducing trial times, the dFDA can recapture this value across the entire pharmaceutical pipeline.
- **Assumptions:**
- **Conservative:** dFDA achieves a modest acceleration, equivalent to the gains seen in the cancer study.
- **Base:** A 2-year average acceleration across a broader range of therapies, including but not limited to oncology.
- **Optimistic:** A more profound acceleration (3+ years) combined with an increased number of successful drugs due to lower trial costs.
- **Annual QALY Estimates:**
- **Conservative:** 90,000 QALYs
- **Base:** 24% QALYs
- **Optimistic:** 500,000 QALYs

#### B. Improving Preventative Care via Real-World Evidence

This stream captures the value of using the dFDA's vast data to optimize preventative care and the use of existing treatments.

- **Rationale:** Research demonstrates that existing cancer screenings have already saved millions of life-years, with much potential still untapped at full adherence. The dFDA Infrastructure can identify at-risk populations and measure the real-world effectiveness of preventative interventions (e.g., statins, diabetes screening, lifestyle changes) at a massive scale.
- **Assumptions:**
- **Conservative:** The platform leads to modest improvements in adherence and targeting for a few key preventative measures.
- **Base:** The platform drives significant uptake and better targeting of established preventative care across multiple chronic diseases.
- **Optimistic:** The platform uncovers new, highly effective preventative strategies and enables their rapid, widespread adoption.
- **Annual QALY Estimates:**
- **Conservative:** 50,000 QALYs
- **Base:** 17% QALYs
- **Optimistic:** 150,000 QALYs

#### C. Enabling Research for Previously Untreatable/Neglected Diseases

This stream reflects the transformative potential of the dFDA to create viable research pathways for conditions that are currently ignored due to high trial costs and small patient populations, such as rare diseases.

- **Rationale:** Over 7,000 rare diseases affect 30 million Americans, yet most lack an FDA-approved treatment. The dFDA's radically lower per-patient trial cost makes R&D in this area economically feasible for the first time. A single successful new therapy for a rare disease affecting just 20,000 people could generate over 50,000 QALYs.
- **Assumptions:**
- **Conservative:** The platform enables at least one successful new treatment for a smaller rare disease population each year.
- **Base:** The platform facilitates several new treatments annually or one major breakthrough for a more common rare disease.
- **Optimistic:** The low-cost model spurs a wave of innovation, leading to dozens of new therapies for rare diseases and other neglected research areas.
- **Annual QALY Estimates:**
- **Conservative:** 50,000 QALYs
- **Base:** 60% QALYs
- **Optimistic:** 3,000,000 QALYs

#### Summary Table: Total Annual QALY Gains {#qaly-summary-table}

| Scenario         | (A) Accelerated Development | (B) Improved Prevention | (C) New Research | **Total Annual QALYs** |
| :--------------- | --------------------------: | ----------------------: | ---------------: | ---------------------: |
| **Conservative** | 90,000 | 50,000 | 50,000 | **190,000** |
| **Base Case**    | 24% | 17% | 60% | **840,000** |

### Daily Opportunity Cost of Inaction

This section quantifies the daily societal cost of maintaining the status quo, framed as the opportunity cost of not implementing the dFDA Infrastructure. By translating the annualized benefits identified in this analysis into a daily metric, we can better appreciate the urgency of the proposed transformation. The "cost of inaction" is the value of the health gains (QALYs) and financial savings (R&D efficiencies) that are forgone each day the dFDA system is not operational.

#### Base Case: Daily Lost QALYs and Financial Savings

The calculations below are based on the central ("base case") estimates established in the preceding sections of this analysis.

- **Daily QALYs Lost:**
  - The analysis ([Appendix: Detailed QALY Calculation Model](#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model)) projects a baseline of **[840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained per year](#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains)** from the dFDA's impact.
  - The daily opportunity cost in lost health is therefore:
    $$
    \frac{840,000\ \text{QALYs}}{365\ \text{days}} \approx \mathbf{840,000\ \text{QALYs lost per day}}
    $$

- **Daily Financial Value Lost:**
  - The analysis ([Gross R and D Savings from dFDA Implementation](#gross-r-and-d-savings-from-dfda-implementation)) projects gross R&D savings of **[$50.0B per year](#gross-r-and-d-savings-from-dfda-implementation)** by reducing the costs of the [**$100.0B global clinical trial market**](#market-size-and-impact) by [**50.0%**](#gross-r-and-d-savings-from-dfda-implementation). This represents value that is currently being spent inefficiently.
  - The daily financial loss from this inefficiency is:
    $$
    \frac{\$50,000,000,000}{365\ \text{days}} \approx \mathbf{\$137\ \text{million lost per day}}
    $$

#### Sensitivity Analysis of Daily Opportunity Costs

The daily costs of inaction are highly sensitive to the underlying assumptions about R&D cost reduction and QALY gains. The following table explores this uncertainty by showing the daily opportunity cost across a range of scenarios, from conservative to transformative, based on the [QALY Calculation Model](#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model).

| Scenario                                 | R&D Trial Cost Reduction | Annual Gross Savings | Annual QALYs Gained | Daily Money Lost (Approx.) | Daily QALYs Lost (Approx.) | Note                                                                                                                                              |
| :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------: | :------------------: | :-----------------: | :------------------------: | :------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Conservative**                         |           30%            |     \$30 Billion     | **190,000** | **\$82 Million** | **190,000** | Assumes lower efficiency gains and moderate health impact, using [conservative QALY model](#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains). |
| **Base Case**                            |         **50%**          |   **\$50 Billion**   | **840,000** | **\$137 Million** | **840,000** | **The central estimate used in this analysis, based on the [median QALY model](#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains).** |
| **Optimistic**                           |           70%            |     \$70 Billion     | **3,650,000** | **\$192 Million** | **3,650,000** | Assumes high efficiency and significant improvements in health outcomes, using [optimistic QALY model](#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains). |
| **Transformative (RECOVERY Trial-like)** |         **95%**          |   **\$95 Billion**   | **3,650,000** | **\$260 Million** | **3,650,000** | Reflects exceptional, RECOVERY-like efficiency and broad health benefits, using [new optimistic QALY model](#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains). |

#### Discussion of Uncertainty and Key Variables

While the figures are presented as daily point estimates for clarity, they represent the steady-state potential loss once the dFDA Infrastructure is fully adopted. The actual daily loss on any given day depends on several key variables that introduce uncertainty:

1. **Adoption Rate ($p(t)$):** The calculations above implicitly assume full adoption ($p(t)=1$). As modeled in the NPV analysis in the [ROI Analysis section](#roi-analysis), adoption will be gradual. Therefore, the daily opportunity cost will ramp up over time, starting smaller and growing as the platform's use becomes standard. The figures represent the daily cost once that potential is reached.
2. **Magnitude of R&D Savings ($\alpha$):** The percentage reduction in R&D costs is a critical variable. While the 95% reduction seen in the RECOVERY trial demonstrates what is possible, the system-wide average may be lower. The sensitivity table addresses this by showing a range from 30% to 95%.
3. **Realization of QALY Gains:** The link between a more efficient research ecosystem and concrete health outcomes (QALYs) is complex. The estimates for QALYs gained are based on evidence from studies on the value of faster drug access and improved prevention, but the exact magnitude of the dFDA's impact remains a projection.

**Conclusion:** Despite these uncertainties, the analysis consistently shows that the daily opportunity cost of inaction is substantial across all plausible scenarios. Every day that the current inefficient, slow, and expensive paradigm for clinical research is maintained, society forgoes hundreds of quality-adjusted life-years and tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in value. This provides a powerful, daily reminder of the urgency and immense potential of the dFDA initiative.

### Final ROI and Net Benefit

- **Central ROI Estimate:** [463:1](#final-roi-and-net-benefit)
- **Central Net Benefit (10-Year, Discounted):** [~\$249 Billion](#final-roi-and-net-benefit)
- **Dominant Health Intervention:** The dFDA is cost-saving while simultaneously generating substantial health gains (QALYs), making it a dominant intervention from a health economics perspective.

## Comparative Cost-Effectiveness: dFDA vs. Other Public Health Interventions

To provide context for the dFDA Infrastructure's impact, the chart below visualizes its cost-effectiveness against other well-understood public health programs. The metric used is **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) Gained per $1 Million of Spending**. A higher number signifies greater cost-effectiveness.

For standard interventions, this value is calculated as `$1,000,000 / ICER`, where the ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) is the cost to gain one QALY. For **dominant** interventions that are both more effective and less expensive, the ICER is negative, and this metric isn't strictly applicable. For these cases, an illustrative range is used to represent their high value.

All data used in the chart is derived from the table and sources below.

### Methodology Notes

<a id="ref_chart_calc"></a>¹ **QALYs per $1M Calculation**:

- For interventions with positive ICERs: `1,000,000 / ICER`
- For the dFDA Infrastructure: `(Annual QALYs Gained) / (Annual Cost in Millions)`
- Ranges reflect conservative to optimistic scenarios accounting for parameter uncertainties

<a id="ref_dfda_icer"></a>² **Negative ICER Interpretation**:

- All dFDA scenarios show negative ICERs, indicating cost-saving while generating health benefits
- The platform is "dominant" - more effective and less costly than the status quo

<a id="ref_dominant"></a>³ **Dominant Interventions**:

- For cost-saving (dominant) interventions, standard QALY/$1M calculations are not applicable
- Values shown are illustrative to demonstrate relative cost-effectiveness
- Upper bounds represent the exceptional value of these interventions

### Data Limitations

- Historical interventions (e.g., smallpox) use retrospective analyses
- Direct comparisons between interventions should consider contextual differences
- All costs are in 2023 USD, adjusted using appropriate health inflation indices
- QALY calculations use standard health state utility weights where available

**Conclusion:** The dFDA initiative is not just a financially sound investment with a high ROI; it is one of the most impactful public health interventions conceivable. Its "dominant" cost-effectiveness profile is comparable to gold-standard programs like childhood vaccination and smoking cessation, but its scale of economic and health benefits is potentially orders of magnitude larger.

## Comparison to Other Major Public Investments

To provide context for the dFDA's estimated costs, it is useful to compare them to other significant U.S. government investments in health and technology. The dFDA's projected "Lean Ecosystem" cost of approximately **[$40M per year](#simplified-roi-scenario)** (covering core platform operations plus medium-scope broader initiatives) is modest in comparison to other major federal projects.

| Initiative / Project                 | Approximate Cost / Budget (Annualized)                                                             | Comparison to dFDA Annual Cost           | Source / Note                                                              |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **dFDA Infrastructure (Lean Ecosystem)**   | **~$40M / year**                                                                           | **1x (Baseline)**                        | [This analysis](#simplified-roi-scenario)                                  |
| **Cancer Moonshot Initiative**       | **~\$257 Million / year** ($1.8B over 7 years)          | **~6.4x**                                | See [NCI Budget](../references.qmd#nih-nci-budget-breakdown)          |
| **NIH "All of Us" Research Program** | **~\$500 Million / year** (FY23 Approx. Budget) | **~12.5x**                               | See [NIH All of Us Program](../references.qmd#nih-all-of-us-program)              |
| **HealthCare.gov (Initial Build)**   | **~\$1.7 - \$2.1 Billion** (Total Upfront Cost)        | **~42x - 52x** (of one year's dFDA cost) | See [GAO HealthCare.gov costs](../references.qmd#gao-healthcare-gov-costs) |
| **National Cancer Institute (NCI)**  | **~\$7.2 Billion / year** (FY25 Budget)                 | **~180x**                                | See [NCI Budget](../references.qmd#nih-nci-budget-breakdown)                 |

**Key Takeaway:** The estimated annual cost of the dFDA initiative is an order of magnitude smaller than the budgets for other major national health priorities like the "All of Us" program or the Cancer Moonshot. It represents approximately **0.55%** of the NCI's annual budget (calculated from [dFDA annual cost](#simplified-roi-scenario) and [NCI budget](#comparison-to-other-major-public-investments)). This comparison underscores that the dFDA Infrastructure is not only a high-leverage investment (due to its massive ROI) but also a remarkably cost-effective one relative to the scale of federal health and technology spending.

### Appendix: Detailed QALY Calculation Model {#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model}

This appendix provides a transparent, component-based model for the aggregate QALY figures used in this analysis. The total QALY gain is the sum of three distinct benefit streams. For each stream, we define parameters for a **Conservative**, **Base**, and **Optimistic** scenario, with sources and rationale provided for each parameter.

#### A. QALYs from Faster Drug Access

This stream models the benefit of accelerating the approval of new drugs that would likely be developed under the current paradigm, but more slowly.

- **Parameters:**
  - $N_{\text{drugs}}$: Number of new drugs approved annually whose development is accelerated.
    - **Rationale:** The FDA approves a significant number of new drugs each year, and the dFDA Infrastructure is expected to accelerate the development of a meaningful fraction of these.
    - **Source:** The FDA consistently approves a substantial number of novel therapies. For example, [in 2023, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 55 novel drugs](../references.qmd#friends-cancer-research-fda-approvals).
  - $T_{\text{accel}}$: Average years of acceleration per drug.
    - **Rationale:** The dFDA model, inspired by hyper-efficient trials like the [RECOVERY trial](recovery-trial.qmd), can drastically cut development timelines from years to months.
    - **Source:** The [RECOVERY trial](recovery-trial.qmd) demonstrated unprecedented speed in generating clinical results.
    - **Quote:** "Days to First Major Result: <100" — [The Conversation, via dFDA Wiki](recovery-trial.qmd)
  - $\text{QALYs}_{\text{drug}}$: Average QALYs gained per drug, per year of earlier access.
    - **Rationale:** Accelerating access to effective drugs has a direct and significant impact on life-years and quality of life.

- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{QALYs}_A = N_{\text{drugs}} \times T_{\text{accel}} \times \text{QALYs}_{\text{drug}}
  $$

- **Scenario Values:**
  - **Conservative:** 15 drugs/year $\times$ 1 year acceleration $\times$ 6,000 QALYs/drug = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**90,000 QALYs**</a>
  - **Base:** 20 drugs/year $\times$ 1.5 years acceleration $\times$ 6,667 QALYs/drug = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**24% QALYs**</a>
  - **Optimistic:** 25 drugs/year $\times$ 2 years acceleration $\times$ 10,000 QALYs/drug = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**500,000 QALYs**</a>

#### B. QALYs from Improved Prevention and Real-World Evidence (RWE)

This stream models the benefit of using the dFDA's vast data to optimize preventative care and the use of existing treatments.

- **Parameters:**
  - $P_{\text{impacted}}$: Number of patients benefiting from new preventative guidelines or RWE-driven treatment changes.
    - **Rationale:** [Chronic diseases affect a vast portion of the population](../references.qmd#us-chronic-disease-spending), and even small improvements in prevention or treatment optimization, scaled across millions of people, can generate substantial health gains.
  - $\text{QALYs}_{\text{per\_patient}}$: Average small QALY gain per impacted patient from better-targeted prevention or treatment.
    - **Rationale:** While the per-person gain from preventative measures may be small in a single year, they are well-established. The value comes from applying these small gains to a very large population. For example, [statin treatment provides a gain of 0.20 QALYs](../references.qmd#qaly-delayed-access-cost) in men aged 60 years.

- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{QALYs}_B = P_{\text{impacted}} \times \text{QALYs}_{\text{per\_patient}}
  $$

  - **Conservative:** 5 million patients $\times$ 0.01 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**50,000 QALYs**</a>
  - **Base:** 14 million patients $\times$ 0.01 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**17% QALYs**</a>

#### C. QALYs from Expanded Scope (New Therapies)

This stream models the benefit of enabling trials for therapies that are currently neglected due to high cost (e.g., rare diseases, unpatentable treatments, novel nutraceuticals). The model is based on the number of new therapies, the average patient population per therapy, and the QALY gain per patient.

- **Parameters:**
  - $N_{\text{new\_therapies}}$: Number of entirely new, effective therapies enabled per year for untreated conditions.
    - **Rationale:** There is a vast unmet need in the rare disease space, with [only about 5% of the nearly 10,000 identified rare diseases having FDA-approved treatments](../references.qmd#95-pct-diseases-no-treatment). Lowering trial costs via the dFDA Infrastructure would catalyze R&D for this underserved population.
  - $P_{\text{therapy}}$: Average number of patients benefiting from a new rare disease therapy.
    - **Rationale:** While "rare" in the US means affecting fewer than 200,000 people, the median prevalence is much lower. This estimate uses a conservative figure for the addressable population for a new, breakthrough therapy. [Analysis of Orphanet data](../references.qmd#rare-disease-prevalence-400m) suggests a median prevalence of 1-5 per 100,000 people.
  - $\text{QALYs}_{\text{patient}}$: Average QALY gain per patient receiving a transformative therapy.
    - **Rationale:** A new therapy for a previously untreatable, life-threatening condition can have a profound impact, corresponding to many years of high-quality life.
    - **Source:** Therapies for diseases like spinal muscular atrophy or certain inherited retinal diseases can be considered near-curative, generating dozens of QALYs per patient over a lifetime.

- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{QALYs}_C = N_{\text{new\_therapies}} \times P_{\text{therapy}} \times \text{QALYs}_{\text{patient}}
  $$

- **Scenario Values:**
  - **Conservative:** 5 new therapies/year $\times$ 2,000 patients/therapy $\times$ 5 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**50,000 QALYs**</a>
  - **Base:** 10 new therapies/year $\times$ 5,000 patients/therapy $\times$ 10 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**60% QALYs**</a>
  - **Optimistic:** 20 new therapies/year $\times$ 10,000 patients/therapy $\times$ 15 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**3,000,000 QALYs**</a>

#### Summary of Total Annual QALY Gains {#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains}

This table summarizes the component calculations and derives the total QALY range used in the main analysis. The final totals are hyperlinked back to the [main body of the analysis](#parameterization-overall-dfda-platform-impact). The model demonstrates that even with conservative, evidence-based inputs, the potential health benefit is substantial, providing a strong rationale for the dFDA initiative.
