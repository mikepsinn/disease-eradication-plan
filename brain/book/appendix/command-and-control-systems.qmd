## 1. Overview

This document outlines the definitive architecture for the **`DIH Command & Control`** Airtable base.

It is the single source of truth for the War on Disease.

## 2. Base Architecture: The G-Staff Model

The base is structured around the G-Staff military command model, ensuring every aspect of the operation is covered. The architecture is person-centric, with the `Personnel Roster` serving as the central hub.
