## Or: What We Optimized For Instead of Curing Disease

This analysis calculates the cost per death for a modern nuclear weapon. Then it uses that figure to estimate the potential human cost of the $2.69 trillion military budget that would remain AFTER redirecting 1% to health research.

Spoiler: Even after giving 1% to medical research, we'd still have enough money to end civilization 20 times.

This is not a defense strategy. This is a hobby.

## On The Price of a City-Destroying Weapon

**How much does one nuclear bomb cost?**

This is harder to calculate than you'd think, because the military bundles warhead costs into "modernization programs" and "delivery systems" to hide the individual price tags.

But we have the **B61-12 Life Extension Program** as a benchmark:

- **Unit Cost:** [**$27.5 million**](../references.qmd#b61-12-cost) per bomb
- **Program Cost:** [**$11 billion**](../references.qmd#b61-12-cost) for 400-500 bombs

So: **$27.5 million** per city-destroying weapon.

For context, that's less than one F-35 fighter jet costs. You could buy 3-4 nuclear warheads for the price of one plane.

## On How Many People One Bomb Kills

**How many people die when you detonate a modern nuclear warhead?**

This depends on:
- Weapon yield (how big the explosion is)
- Population density (how many people are there to kill)
- Detonation type (airburst vs. ground burst)

Modern strategic warheads are many times more powerful than the bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. We've gotten very good at this.

### The Simulation

NUKEMAP (created by historian Alex Wellerstein) simulates nuclear detonations. If you detonate a single, modern 300-kiloton W87 warhead over Manhattan:

- **Estimated Fatalities:** [**1,619,570 people**](../references.qmd#w87-casualties)

That's immediate deaths from the blast, heat, and initial radiation.

It doesn't include long-term deaths from fallout, disease, starvation, or the collapse of medical infrastructure. Those numbers are much higher. But we're being conservative.

## On The Math That Makes You Uncomfortable

Now we can calculate the cost to kill one person with a nuclear weapon:

- **Cost per Bomb:** $27,500,000
- **Deaths per Bomb:** 1,619,570
- **Cost per Death:** $27,500,000 ÷ 1,619,570 = **$16.98 per person**

### Translation

For the price of a Starbucks latte, our military can kill one human being.

We've industrialized death to the point where killing you costs less than caffeinating you.

## On What Happens After We Give 1% to Medical Research

The 1% Treaty redirects 1% of military spending to cure disease.

This leaves $2.69 trillion for killing people.

Let's calculate how much killing that buys:

### Step 1: How many bombs?

$2,690,000,000,000 ÷ $27,500,000 per bomb = **97,818 bombs**

#### Step 2: How many deaths?

97,818 bombs × 1,619,570 deaths per bomb = **158,421,000,000 people**

#### Translation

After giving 1% to medical research, the remaining 99% of military spending could still buy enough nuclear weapons to kill **158.4 billion people**.

Earth's population: **8 billion**

##### Overkill capacity: 20× Earth's population

We could kill everyone on Earth twenty times.

Not "once, but thoroughly." Not "twice, to be safe."

###### Twenty times.

This is what we mean when we say the 1% Treaty is a modest proposal. We're asking militaries to keep enough firepower to end civilization 19 times instead of 20.

Nobody needs to end civilization 20 times. That's just showing off.

## On The Summary (In Case You Skipped The Math)

### What Nuclear Weapons Cost

- Cost per death: **$16.98** (less than coffee)
- B61-12 unit cost: **$27.5 million** per bomb
- Deaths per W87 warhead (Manhattan): **1,619,570 people**

#### What The 1% Treaty Changes

- Current military budget: **$2.72 trillion/year**
- After 1% redirect: **$2.69 trillion remaining** (99%)
- Potential deaths with remaining budget: **158.4 billion people**
- Earth's population: **8 billion**
- **Overkill capacity after treaty: 20× Earth's population**

Even after redirecting 1% to medical research, we'd still have enough destructive capacity to kill everyone on Earth approximately twenty times.

The 1% Treaty doesn't disarm anyone. It just reduces overkill from "absurd" to "slightly less absurd."

## On Comparing Different Ways to Kill People (The Efficiency Rankings)

Now that we've established nuclear weapons cost $16.98 per death, let's compare them to other weapons.

This is the darkest optimization problem in human history. But here we are.

### Small Arms (Rifles/Machine Guns)

In Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. forces fired approximately **250,000 bullets for every insurgent killed**.

- Cost per bullet: **$0.40**
- Bullets per death: **250,000**
- **Cost per death: $100,000**

### Artillery (155mm Howitzer Shells)

- Typical fire missions use **10-50 rounds** per target
- Cost per shell: **$8,000-$14,000**
- Assuming 20 rounds per casualty at $10,000 per shell
- **Cost per death: $200,000**

### Precision-Guided Munitions

#### Excalibur GPS-Guided Artillery

- Cost per round: **$176,624**
- Higher accuracy, fewer rounds needed (1-2 rounds)
- **Cost per death: $177,000-$350,000**

#### Air-Launched Missiles

- AMRAAM: **~$1 million**
- AARGM-ER: **~$6.1 million**
- **Cost per death: $1-6 million+**

### Nuclear Weapons (The Winner)

- B61-12 cost: **$27.5 million**
- Deaths per detonation: **~1.6 million**
- **Cost per death: $16.98**

### The Leaderboard (Most to Least "Efficient")

| Weapon Type | Cost per Death | What This Says About Us |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------------|
| Nuclear warhead | **$16.98** | We optimized genocide |
| Small arms | **$100,000** | Inefficient but personal |
| Artillery | **$200,000** | Impersonal and wasteful |
| Precision artillery | **$177,000-$350,000** | "Precision" is expensive |
| Missiles | **$1-6 million+** | Very expensive, very deadly |

#### The Math That Proves We're Insane

Nuclear weapons are **5,900× more "cost-effective"** at killing than small arms.

They're **10,000-350,000× more "cost-effective"** than precision missiles.

This explains why $2.69 trillion in military spending has such enormous destructive capacity: We've optimized for maximum death per dollar.

#### The Point

This grotesque "efficiency" calculation exists to illustrate one thing: We've industrialized human destruction to a degree that would make assembly line manufacturers jealous.

We can calculate a "cost per death" metric. We've optimized it. We've competed on it.

Meanwhile, we spend almost nothing on curing disease.

The 1% Treaty redirects 1% of this death budget to the not-dying budget.

That's it. That's the whole proposal.
