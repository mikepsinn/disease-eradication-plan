## Overview

The [1% Treaty](1-percent-treaty.qmd) initiative faces three critical legal challenges: **foreign national election funding restrictions**, **securities law compliance for [VICTORY bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**, and **international coordination of legal structures**. This document provides a detailed compliance strategy.

## Challenge 1: Foreign National Election Funding

### **The Legal Problem**

- **US Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA):** Prohibits foreign nationals from making expenditures in connection with US elections ([FEC Foreign National Restrictions](../references.qmd#fec-foreign-national-restrictions))
- **FEC Definition:** ["Foreign national" includes foreign governments, foreign political parties, foreign corporations, and foreign individuals](../references.qmd#fec-foreign-nationals)
- **Penalties:** Criminal prosecution and [civil penalties up to \$100,000+ per violation](../references.qmd#feca-violation-penalties)

### **Compliance Solution: Domestic-Only Structure**

**US Operations (Completely Segregated):**

- **Entity:** 501(c)(4) social welfare organization + affiliated Super PAC
- **Funding:** 100% US persons only (citizens and permanent residents)
- **Decision-Making:** 100% US persons in all leadership roles
- **Banking:** Separate US-only bank accounts
- **Compliance Officer:** Former FEC official overseeing all US operations

**International Coordination (No Direct Connection):**

- **Strategy Alignment:** Public commitment to support districts that favor 1% Treaty
- **No Coordination:** Zero communication between US and international entities about specific campaigns
- **Independent Research:** Both organizations independently identify priority districts
- **Parallel Development:** Similar but separately developed messaging and strategy

**Information Firewall:**

- **Separate Legal Counsel:** Different law firms for US and international operations
- **No Shared Staff:** Zero overlapping personnel between entities
- **Independent Governance:** Separate boards with no overlapping members
- **Technical Isolation:** Different technology platforms and data systems

### **Enforcement of Non-Coordination**

**Technical Safeguards:**

- **Separate Communication Systems:** No shared Slack, email, or messaging platforms
- **Geographic Separation:** US operations based in Washington DC, international in neutral jurisdiction
- **Legal Monitoring:** Monthly compliance audits by independent election law firm
- **Public Transparency:** All US funding sources and expenditures disclosed per FEC requirements

**Legal Documentation:**

- **Operating Agreements:** Explicit non-coordination clauses in all entity documents
- **Employment Contracts:** Staff prohibited from communicating across entities
- **Vendor Agreements:** Shared vendors prohibited from coordination
- **Insurance Coverage:** Errors & omissions coverage for election law violations

## Challenge 2: Securities Law Compliance

### **The Legal Problem**

- **Howey Test:** Investment of money + common enterprise + expectation of profits + from efforts of others = security ([Howey Test Securities Definition](../references.qmd#howey-test-securities))
- \*\*VICTORY Tokens: Risk of being classified as unregistered securities if they promise returns
- \*\*SEC Enforcement: Heavy penalties for unregistered securities offerings

### **Compliance Solution: A Two-Phase "Points-then-Conversion" Model**

Our compliance strategy is designed to achieve our goal of mass participation while navigating global securities laws, leveraging [the SEC's more innovation-friendly guidance as of August 2025](../references.qmd#sec-innovation-guidance-2025). It separates the initial, non-financial airdrop from the subsequent distribution of valuable governance tokens.

**Phase 1: VOTE Points Airdrop (Pre-Treaty)**

This phase focuses on mass distribution of a non-security utility token.

- **Token Design (Not a Security):**
- **No Financial Value:** VOTE points are explicitly defined as having no financial value and are non-transferable.
- **Pure Utility:** Their sole purpose is to serve as a cryptographically verifiable receipt of participation and a badge of honor.
- **No "Investment of Money":** Points are earned through an action (voting), not purchased.
- **Legal Rationale:** This structure is designed to fail the Howey Test. As a non-tradable token with no promised expectation of profit, it has a very strong argument for not being a security, aligning with the SEC's more favorable stance on non-financial, utility-focused airdrops.

**Phase 2: VICTORY Token Conversion (Post-Treaty)**

This phase occurs only _after_ the 1% Treaty is successfully ratified and the [DIH Treasury](../solution/dih.qmd) is funded. This is the point at which a security is distributed, and it will be handled in a fully compliant manner.

- **Mechanism: Voluntary, Opt-In Conversion:** Holders of VOTE points will have the option to convert their points into real VICTORY governance tokens through a dedicated, compliant portal.
- **Legal Rationale & Safe Harbor:** This conversion event will be structured to [fall within the SEC's "safe harbor" provisions](../references.qmd#peirce-token-safe-harbor) for networks that have become sufficiently decentralized. By the time of conversion, the primary "work of the promoters" (getting the treaty passed) is complete. The VICTORY bond's function is now primarily for utility, governing the active, funded DIH treasury, which strengthens the case for a more favorable regulatory treatment.

**Fundraising from Accredited Investors (Reg D / Reg S)**

The initial "activation energy" from sophisticated investors (VCs, funds, etc.) will still be raised via a traditional private placement for VICTORY bonds and tokens, conducted in full compliance with [Regulation D](../references.qmd#sec-reg-d) (for U.S. accredited investors) and [Regulation S](../references.qmd#sec-reg-s) (for non-U.S. investors). This ensures our core financing is secure while the mass distribution is handled via the safer "Points-then-Conversion" model.

**Legal Structure:**

- **Offshore Foundation:** Singapore or Swiss foundation issuing tokens
- **US Operations:** Separate US entity purchasing tokens on secondary market for operations
- **Legal Opinions:** Securities law analysis from top-tier law firm (Cooley, Wilson Sonsini)
- **Ongoing Compliance:** Regular SEC no-action letter consultation

### **Token Economics Compliance**

**Avoid Investment Contract Characteristics:**

- **No Promises:** Disclaimers that tokens may lose value
- **Utility Focus:** Primary purpose is governance and network participation
- **Decentralized Control:** No single entity controls treasury or token value
- **Market Independence:** Token value determined by market forces, not entity efforts

**Marketing Compliance:**

- **No Investment Language:** Avoid terms like "investment," "returns," "profits"
- **Utility Emphasis:** Marketing focuses on governance and platform access
- **Risk Disclosures:** Prominent warnings about potential total loss
- **Legal Review:** All marketing materials reviewed by securities counsel

## Challenge 3: International Legal Coordination

### **Multi-Jurisdiction Strategy**

**Jurisdiction Selection:**

- **Treaty Operations:** Switzerland (neutral, crypto-friendly, international law expertise)
- **Technology Development:** Estonia (e-governance expertise, EU compliance)
- **Token Issuance:** Singapore (clear crypto regulations, international recognition)
- **US Operations:** Delaware (established corporate law, FEC expertise available)

**Legal Entity Structure:**

```
Swiss Foundation (Treaty Coordination)
    ├── Singapore Foundation (Token Issuance)
    ├── Estonian OÜ (Technology Platform)
    ├── US 501(c)(4) + Super PAC (US Elections)

    └── Canadian Federal Non-Profit (Canadian Operations)
```

### **International Election Law Compliance**

**United Kingdom:**

- **Electoral Commission Registration:** Register as non-party campaigner
- **Spending Limits:** Comply with controlled expenditure limits ([UK Electoral Commission Spending Limits](../references.qmd#uk-electoral-spending-limits)) [(\$500K+ requires registration)](../references.qmd#uk-electoral-registration-threshold-500k)

## Regulatory Reform Agenda

### HHS Policy Recommendations

To maximize the effectiveness of the [dFDA Infrastructure](../solution/dfda.qmd), we recommend HHS sponsor an **FDA-X Prize** (\$500 million) to incentivize creation of an open-source, decentralized FDA platform enabling perpetual, patient-driven clinical trials.

**Key Policy Objectives:**

1. **Enable Perpetual Trials:** Real-time global patient participation with automated matching and dynamic protocol adjustments
2. **Clarify Pricing Mechanisms:** [Allow drug companies to set per-participant prices under FDA regulations (21 CFR 312.8)](../references.qmd#cfr-21-312-8-charging-for-investigational-drugs)
3. **Redirect NIH Funding:** Transition research toward dFDA-leveraging projects
4. **Leverage Medicare/Medicaid:** Utilize existing provisions for clinical trial participation
5. **Incentivize Innovation:** Launch \$500M X Prize for platform development

**Projected Impact:**

- Support 61+ million participants annually (\$30.6B ÷ \$500 per participant)
- Potential for 160+ million participants with Medicare/Medicaid integration
- Trillions in global healthcare savings
- Months instead of years from discovery to deployment

### Priority Regulations for Modification

**High-Priority Streamlining Targets:**

1. **21 CFR Part 312 (IND Applications):** Streamlined CMC requirements, flexible preclinical data, accelerated reviews for certified platforms

2. **21 CFR Parts 56 & 45 CFR Part 46 (IRBs):** Enforce single IRB mandate, standardize requirements, enable AI-assisted review

3. **ICH E6(R2) GCP Guidelines:** Risk-based quality management, reduced documentation for automated platforms, remote monitoring standards

4. **21 CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reporting):** Automated safety reporting from platforms, AI-based signal detection, aggregate reporting for known events

5. **21 CFR Parts 50 & 45 CFR Part 46 (Informed Consent):** Electronic consent validation, dynamic consent for adaptive trials, simplified waivers

**Revolutionary Exemptions for Certified Platforms:**

- **Radical Device Simplification:** Class I/II devices require only registration if evaluated via certified dFDA
- **Platform-Based Post-Market Surveillance:** Replace traditional REMS programs with real-time platform monitoring
- **Dynamic Digital Labeling:** FDA-approved systems for rapid label updates based on platform data
- **Integrated Combination Product Review:** Single coordinated assessment using unified platform data

## The Bottom Line

**Legal compliance is achievable through strict entity separation, jurisdiction-specific expertise, and conservative interpretation of regulations.** The key is building robust firewalls between international strategy and domestic political activities while maintaining strategic coherence through public commitments rather than private coordination.

**Investment Required:** \$15-25M annually for legal compliance across all jurisdictions, but this prevents \$100M+ in potential penalties and shutdown risk.

**Regulatory Reform Opportunity:** The current regulatory framework can be significantly streamlined without new legislation, potentially reducing development costs by 80%+ and accelerating treatment access from years to months.
