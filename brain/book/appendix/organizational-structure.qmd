This document outlines the organizational structure of the two core entities that drive the War on Disease initiative: the For-Profit Management Company (SPV) and the Non-Profit Foundation.

This structure is designed to separate the operational execution and fundraising activities from the mission oversight and governance, a common practice to ensure both efficiency and integrity.

See [Roadmap](../strategy/roadmap.qmd) for details on the roles and responsibilities of the initial hires.

## 1. For-Profit Management Company (SPV)

This entity is the operational engine. It employs the core team, raises investment capital, and executes the strategy.

    end

### Operational Command: The General Staff (G-Staff)

Within the SPV, day-to-day operations for the War on Disease are managed by a General Staff, or "G-Staff," modeled after military command structures. This ensures clear lines of responsibility for every aspect of the campaign.

-   **G-1 (Personnel & Recruitment):** Manages the `Personnel Roster`—our master list of every individual involved. This is the core of our recruitment effort.
-   **G-2 (Intelligence):** Manages intelligence on the enemy (diseases) and the operational landscape. This includes tracking research, trials, and outcomes.
-   **G-3 (Operations):** The warfighters. This department plans and executes the clinical trials via the dFDA.
-   **G-4 (Logistics & Treasury):** Manages the supply lines, primarily the flow of funds from VICTORY Bonds and other sources.
-   **G-5 (Plans & Strategy):** Develops long-term strategy, including the Global Draft, treaty expansions, and major campaigns.
-   **G-6 (Signal & Communications):** Manages all propaganda, internal communications, and the technology platforms (Wishocracy, dFDA).

See the [Command & Control Systems](./command-and-control-systems.qmd) document for the detailed technical implementation of this structure.

## 2. Non-Profit Foundation

This entity is the guardian of the mission. It provides legal and ethical oversight to ensure the project remains aligned with its public benefit goals.

```{mermaid}

    subgraph "Non-Profit Foundation"
        A["Board of Trustees<br/>(Independent, Mission-Aligned)"];
        B["(Future) Executive Director"];

    end

    subgraph "For-Profit Management Co. (SPV)"
        C["Founder & Managing Director"];
    end

    A -- "Provides Mission<br/>Oversight To" --> C;
```
