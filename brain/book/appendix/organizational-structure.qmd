This document outlines the organizational structure of the two core entities that drive the War on Disease initiative: the For-Profit Management Company (SPV) and the Non-Profit Foundation.

This structure is designed to separate the operational execution and fundraising activities from the mission oversight and governance, a common practice to ensure both efficiency and integrity.

See [Roadmap](../strategy/roadmap.qmd) for details on the roles and responsibilities of the initial hires.

## 1. For-Profit Management Company (SPV)

This entity is the operational engine. It employs the core team, raises investment capital, and executes the strategy.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "For-Profit Management Company (SPV) Organizational Structure"
#| fig-alt: "Organizational chart showing Board of Directors at top, Managing Director below, with three leads reporting: Capital Markets, Elections & IE Compliance, and Growth & Referrals. Future hires shown with dashed line."

import graphviz
import sys
from pathlib import Path
from IPython.display import Image as IPImage, display

# Add brain/figures to path for helper import
figures_path = Path.cwd()
if figures_path.name != 'decentralized-institutes-of-health':
    while figures_path.name != 'decentralized-institutes-of-health' and figures_path.parent != figures_path:
        figures_path = figures_path.parent
sys.path.insert(0, str(figures_path / 'brain' / 'figures'))

from _graphviz_helper import setup_graphviz_style, render_graphviz_with_watermark

dot = graphviz.Digraph(comment='For-Profit SPV Structure', format='png')
dot.attr(rankdir='TD', size='8,10')
setup_graphviz_style(dot)

with dot.subgraph(name='cluster_spv') as spv:
    spv.attr(label='For-Profit Management Co. (SPV)', style='dashed')
    spv.node('A', 'Board of Directors\n(Investors & Founder)')
    spv.node('B', 'Managing Director')
    spv.node('C', 'Capital Markets Lead')
    spv.node('D', 'Elections & IE Compliance Lead')
    spv.node('E', 'Growth & Referrals Lead')
    spv.node('F', 'Future Hires\n(Post-Seed Round)\nEngineering Lead, Design Lead, etc.')
    
    spv.edge('A', 'B')
    spv.edge('B', 'C')
    spv.edge('B', 'D')
    spv.edge('B', 'E')
    spv.edge('B', 'F', style='dashed')

png_path = render_graphviz_with_watermark(dot, 'spv-organizational-structure')
display(IPImage(str(png_path)))
```

### Operational Command: The General Staff (G-Staff)

Within the SPV, day-to-day operations for the War on Disease are managed by a General Staff, or "G-Staff," modeled after military command structures. This ensures clear lines of responsibility for every aspect of the campaign.

- **G-1 (Personnel & Recruitment):** Manages the `Personnel Roster`—your master list of every individual involved. This is the core of your recruitment effort.
- **G-2 (Intelligence):** Manages intelligence on the enemy (diseases) and the operational landscape. This includes tracking research, trials, and outcomes.
- **G-3 (Operations):** The warfighters. This department plans and executes the clinical trials via the dFDA.
- **G-4 (Logistics & Treasury):** Manages the supply lines, primarily the flow of funds from VICTORY Bonds and other sources.
- **G-5 (Plans & Strategy):** Develops long-term strategy, including the Global Draft, treaty expansions, and major campaigns.
- **G-6 (Signal & Communications):** Manages all propaganda, internal communications, and the technology platforms (Wishocracy, dFDA).

See the [Command & Control Systems](./command-and-control-systems.qmd) document for the detailed technical implementation of this structure.

## 2. Non-Profit Foundation

This entity is the guardian of the mission. It provides legal and ethical oversight to ensure the project remains aligned with its public benefit goals.

```{python}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "Non-Profit Foundation and SPV Relationship"
#| fig-alt: "Two boxes: Non-Profit Foundation with Board of Trustees overseeing Executive Director, and For-Profit SPV with Founder & Managing Director. Connection shows mission oversight relationship."

# Add brain/figures to path for helper import
figures_path = Path.cwd()
if figures_path.name != 'decentralized-institutes-of-health':
    while figures_path.name != 'decentralized-institutes-of-health' and figures_path.parent != figures_path:
        figures_path = figures_path.parent
sys.path.insert(0, str(figures_path / 'brain' / 'figures'))

from _graphviz_helper import setup_graphviz_style, render_graphviz_with_watermark

dot = graphviz.Digraph(comment='Foundation and SPV Relationship', format='png')
dot.attr(rankdir='TD', size='8,10')
setup_graphviz_style(dot)

with dot.subgraph(name='cluster_foundation') as foundation:
    foundation.attr(label='Non-Profit Foundation', style='dashed')
    foundation.node('A', 'Board of Trustees\n(Independent, Mission-Aligned)')
    foundation.node('B', '(Future) Executive Director')
    foundation.edge('A', 'B')

with dot.subgraph(name='cluster_spv') as spv:
    spv.attr(label='For-Profit Management Co. (SPV)', style='dashed')
    spv.node('C', 'Founder & Managing Director')

dot.edge('A', 'C', label='Provides Mission\nOversight To', style='dashed')

png_path = render_graphviz_with_watermark(dot, 'foundation-spv-relationship')
display(IPImage(str(png_path)))
```
