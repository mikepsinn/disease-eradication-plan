## On How We Solved Medical Progress in 1883, Then Broke It in 1962

**The Setup: 10,000 Years of Not Improving**

For over 99% of recorded human history, [the average human life expectancy was around 30 years](../references.qmd#historical-life-expectancy-30-years).

This was true whether you lived in Ancient Rome, Medieval Europe, or the Renaissance. Kings and peasants, philosophers and farmers, all died at roughly the same embarrassingly young age.

For 10,000 years, we made exactly zero progress.

**1883 – The Year We Figured It Out**

Then something changed.

In 1883, [some doctors founded the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)](../references.qmd#jama-founded-1893) and did something revolutionary: they shared information.

Here's how it worked:

[144,000 physicians](../references.qmd#pre-1962-physician-trials) across America tried treatments on real patients. They wrote down what happened. "This drug helped." "This drug killed the patient." "This drug did nothing but make them smell funny."

Leading experts reviewed all these case reports, compiled them into studies, and published the results. If a medicine worked and didn't kill people, JAMA gave it a seal of approval.

This was crowdsourced, observational, objective, peer-reviewed clinical research. And it worked.

**The Result:**

After 10,000 years of zero progress, human life expectancy suddenly started increasing by 4 years. Every decade. For 80 years.

This is the most linear relationship in medical history. It's suspiciously perfect. And it lasted from 1883 to 1960.

**1938 – The FDA Requires Phase 1 Safety Trials**

A drug called Elixir sulfanilamide caused over [100 deaths](https://www.fda.gov/files/about%20fda/published/The-Sulfanilamide-Disaster.pdf) in the United States in 1937.

Congress [reacted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elixir_sulfanilamide) to the tragedy by requiring all new drugs to include:

> "adequate tests by all methods reasonably applicable to show whether or not such drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling thereof."

These requirements evolved to what is now called the [Phase 1 Safety Trial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_1_safety_trial).

This consistent four-year/decade increase in life expectancy remained unchanged before and after the new safety regulations.

![Fda safety trials life expectancy](../../../assets/fda-safety-trials-life-expectancy.png)

This suggests that the regulations did not have a large-scale positive or negative impact on the development of life-saving interventions.

#### **1950**'s – Thalidomide **Causes Thousands of Birth Defects Outside US**

Thalidomide was first marketed in Europe in [1957](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide) for morning sickness. While it was initially thought to be safe in pregnancy, [it resulted in thousands of horrific congenital disabilities](../references.qmd#thalidomide-birth-defects).

Fortunately, [the existing FDA safety regulations prevented any birth defects in the US](../references.qmd#thalidomide-no-us-birth-defects). Despite the effectiveness of the existing US regulatory framework in protecting Americans, newspaper stories such as the one below created a strong public outcry for increased regulation.

![Thalidomide](../../../assets/thalidomide.jpg)

#### **1962 – The Year We Decided to Make Everything Worse**

Effective **safety** regulations were already in place. They worked. America had zero Thalidomide deaths while Europe had thousands.

So naturally, the government responded to this success by regulating **efficacy** testing instead via the [1962 Kefauver Harris Amendment](../references.qmd#kefauver-harris-amendment-1962).

**What Changed:**

Before 1962:
- Drug companies spent [$74 million](../references.qmd#pre-1962-drug-costs-timeline) (inflation-adjusted) to prove safety
- Once approved as safe, [144,000 independent doctors tested efficacy](../references.qmd#pre-1962-physician-trials) on real patients
- The third-party AMA compiled results and published findings

After 1962:
- FDA took over efficacy testing
- [Made the old system illegal](../references.qmd#kefauver-harris-amendment-1962)
- Required small, controlled trials run by... the drug companies themselves

Let's pause on that irony: The new regulations were meant to ensure drugs work. They did this by:
1. Banning large real-world trials
2. Requiring small artificial trials
3. Letting drug companies run their own tests

Genius.

**On What Happened to Efficacy Data:**

The 1962 regulations, which were explicitly about ensuring efficacy, massively reduced the quantity and quality of efficacy data for three reasons:

- **Trials Got Smaller**: Fewer patients, less data
- **Patients Got Less Representative**: Excluded sick people, old people, people with other conditions—you know, the people who actually need medicine
- **Conflicts of Interest Exploded**: Drug companies ran their own trials instead of independent doctors

**On What Happened to New Treatments:**

The new regulations immediately [reduced new drug approvals by 70%](../references.qmd#post-1962-drug-approval-drop).

Not gradually. Immediately.

![Graph showing new treatments per year decline after 1962](../../../assets/new-treatments-per-year-2.png)

**On What Happened to Costs:**

Since 1962, the cost of bringing a new treatment to market went from [$74 million to over $1 billion](https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmselect/cmhealth/42/4207.htm) (inflation-adjusted).

That's a 13x increase. For worse results.

![Cost to Get a New Drug to Market](../../../assets/cost-to-develop-a-new-drug.png)

**On What Happened to Drug Patents:**

The new regulations created such a massive delay that the pharmaceutical industry complained about a "drug lag."

So Congress "fixed" this by [extending drug patent monopolies](../references.qmd#drug-price-competition-act-1984) in 1984.

Kefauver's amendments, which were meant to make drugs safer and cheaper, instead made them:
- Less safe (smaller trials, less real-world data)
- More expensive (monopolies extended)
- Less available (70% fewer approvals)

This is government efficiency.

**Decreased Ability to Determine Comparative Efficacy**

The placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial helped researchers gauge the efficacy of an individual drug. However, it makes the determination of comparative effectiveness much more difficult.

**On What Happened to Life Expectancy (The Part That Matters)**

Remember that suspiciously linear 4-year increase in life expectancy every decade from 1883 to 1960?

Here's what happened in 1962:

It immediately cut in half. To 2 years per decade.

![Average Life Expectancy Over Time](../../../assets/real-world-evidence-in-efficacy-clinical-trials-vs-rcts.png)

Not gradually. Not "it slowed down over the next decade."

**Immediately.**

From 1883 to 1960: 4 years per decade.

From 1962 onward: 2 years per decade.

The break is so clean you can see exactly when Congress decided to "help."

**On The "Diminishing Returns" Excuse**

Some people say "diminishing returns explain the slowdown."

Diminishing returns produce exponential decay. A smooth curve that gradually flattens over time.

![What diminishing returns would look like](../../../assets/diminishing-returns.png)

This is not what happened.

What happened was a straight line that instantly changed slope in 1962 when the regulations changed.

Diminishing returns don't produce sudden linear breaks. Regulatory changes do.

**On The "Correlation Is Not Causation" Excuse**

True. Correlation alone proves nothing.

But correlation + mechanism + temporal precision is how science works.

Here's what we have:

1. **Temporal correlation**: Life expectancy growth cut in half immediately after 1962 regulations
2. **Mechanism**: Regulations reduced new treatments by 70%, increased costs 13x, banned real-world efficacy trials
3. **Alternative explanations**: None that explain a sudden linear break in 1962

This is literally how clinical trials work: temporal correlation + mechanism of action = inference of causation.

If we don't trust this method, we can't trust any clinical research. Or science generally.

**The Summary:**

- 10,000 years: Zero progress
- 1883: Decentralized real-world trials, 4 years/decade progress
- 1962: FDA takes over, progress cut in half
- 2025: Still stuck with the broken system

We solved medical progress in 1883. We broke it in 1962. We're still living with the consequences.
