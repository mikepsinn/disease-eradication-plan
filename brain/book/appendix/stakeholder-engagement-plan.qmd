## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this plan is to establish a simple, effective, and low-cost system for capturing, categorizing, and managing expressions of interest from key stakeholders during the initiative's pre-seed ("Phase 0") stage.

This phase precedes the formal establishment of legal entities and financial instruments. The goal is not to solicit funds, but to build a high-quality contact list of potential early supporters to de-risk the subsequent seed fundraising round.

## 2. The Problem: Premature Calls to Action

The current public-facing materials direct users to "Donate" or "Buy VICTORY Bonds." These actions are not yet possible, as the required legal and financial infrastructure does not exist. This creates a poor user experience and fails to capture valuable early interest.

## 3. The Solution: A Lightweight CRM with Airtable

We will use **Airtable** as a simple, no-cost Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. It provides the ideal balance of flexibility and ease of use for this stage.

- **Why Airtable?**
  - **Free:** The free tier is more than sufficient for this initial phase.
  - **Flexible:** It functions as a database, allowing for easy categorization and management of contacts.
  - **Easy Form Creation:** Airtable's native form builder is clean, simple, and embeds easily.
  - **Scalable:** It can be easily integrated with other tools (like email marketing services) or exported to a more powerful CRM (like HubSpot) in a later phase.

## 4. Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Create the Airtable Base

A single Airtable base named "DIH Stakeholder Interest" will be created. It will contain three primary tables:

1.  **Investors:** To capture interest in VICTORY Bonds.
2.  **Donors:** To capture interest in philanthropic support for the 501(c)(3).
3.  **Partners:** To capture interest from potential nonprofit and institutional partners.

### Step 2: Design the Forms

Three distinct Airtable forms will be created, one for each table. To better segment contacts and tailor future outreach, each form will collect specific, relevant information.

#### Investor Interest Form

-   **Name** (First, Last)
-   **Email Address**
-   **Organization / Fund** (Optional)
-   **Role / Title** (Optional)
-   **Potential Investment Range** (Dropdown: <$25k, $25k-$100k, $100k-$500k, $500k+)
-   **Type of Investor** (Dropdown: Angel, VC, Family Office, Individual, Other)
-   **LinkedIn Profile URL** (Optional)
-   **How did you hear about us?** (Optional)
-   **Memo/Message** (Open text)
-   **Opt-in for Updates** (Checkbox)

#### Donor Interest Form

-   **Name** (First, Last)
-   **Email Address**
-   **Organization** (Optional)
-   **Primary Area of Interest** (Dropdown: General Support, Research, Technology Development, Advocacy)
-   **Are you interested in volunteering?** (Checkbox, with optional text field for skills)
-   **How did you hear about us?** (Optional)
-   **Memo/Message** (Open text)
-   **Opt-in for Updates** (Checkbox)

#### Partner Interest Form

-   **Contact Name** (First, Last)
-   **Contact Email**
-   **Organization Name**
-   **Organization Type** (Dropdown: Nonprofit, Research Institution, University, For-Profit, Government, Other)
-   **Website**
-   **Area of Potential Collaboration** (Checkboxes: Research, Advocacy, Technology, Community Building, Other)
-   **Briefly describe your organization's mission.** (Open text)
-   **Memo/Message** (Open text)
-   **Opt-in for Updates** (Checkbox)

### Step 3: Update Public-Facing Calls to Action

The `dih-index.qmd` website and any other public materials will be updated to replace the "Donate" and "Buy Bonds" buttons with links that direct users to these new Airtable forms.

- **"Buy VICTORY Bonds"** will link to the **Investor Interest Form**.
- **"Donate Now"** will link to the **Donor Interest Form**.
- A new call to action, **"Partner With Us,"** will be created, linking to the **Partner Interest Form**.

The links will be placeholders (e.g., `https://airtable.com/form/investor-interest`) until the actual forms are created.

### Step 4: Manage and Nurture Leads

The core team will be responsible for:

- **Reviewing submissions** weekly.
- **Categorizing and tagging** high-potential leads.
- **Sending periodic updates** to everyone who has opted in, keeping them engaged as the project moves through Phase 0 and into a formal seed round.

## 5. Next Steps

1.  Create the "DIH Stakeholder Interest" Airtable base.
2.  Create the three forms (Investor, Donor, Partner).
3.  Update the links on `dih-index.qmd` to point to the live Airtable form URLs.
4.  Add this document to the `_quarto.yml` appendices to ensure it is included in the full book build.

This plan provides a clear, actionable, and low-cost path to professionally manage stakeholder interest and build the foundation for a successful seed fundraising campaign.
