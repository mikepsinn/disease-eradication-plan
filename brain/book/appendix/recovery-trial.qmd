The Oxford RECOVERY trial isn't theory, it's proof. In 2020, while the FDA spent [$41,000 per patient](../references.qmd#trial-cost-41k) on traditional trials, Oxford spent [$500 per patient](../references.qmd#recovery-cost-500) and [saved over 1 million lives globally](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-1m-lives-saved). This 82x efficiency gain demonstrates that decentralized, pragmatic trials aren't just possible, they're already superior to centralized FDA approaches.

**Speed to Launch:** [9 days from conception to first patient enrolled](../references.qmd#landray-recovery-trial-quote). FDA average: [6-12 months](../references.qmd#fda-trial-launch-timeline).
**Speed to Results:** First life-saving treatment (dexamethasone) [identified in 100 days](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-100-days-to-cure). FDA average: [6-10 years](../references.qmd#fda-approval-timeline-10-years).
**Lives Saved Per Dollar:** $2,700 per life saved ($2.7M total cost ÷ 1M lives). FDA trials: Often never save any lives.

The RECOVERY trial enrolled 49,000 patients across 186 hospitals, tested 12 treatments, saved a million lives, and cost less than a single F-35 fighter jet.

How did they do it? By doing the obvious things the FDA refuses to do:

### They Used Regular Hospitals

Instead of requiring specialized research centers with dedicated staff and gold-plated equipment, RECOVERY just... used regular hospitals. The ones that already exist. With regular doctors. Treating regular patients.

#### They Collected Only Useful Data

The trial focused on core outcomes: "Did the patient live or die? Did they get better or worse?"

No seventeen-page questionnaires about quality of life. No daily blood draws for biomarkers nobody understands. Just: "Did it work?"

They used existing hospital data. One standardized form. Done.

##### They Integrated With Normal Care

Patients got the experimental treatment as part of their regular care. No separate research facility. No white-coated researchers hovering with clipboards. Just normal doctors providing normal care, except some patients got the experimental drug.

Turns out this works fine. Who knew.

###### They Were Flexible

When a treatment didn't work, they stopped testing it. When a new promising treatment emerged, they added it.

The FDA would require a completely new trial for each change. RECOVERY just... changed. Like adults making decisions.

###### They Prioritized Speed Over Bureaucracy

RECOVERY answered important clinical questions quickly using existing infrastructure.

The FDA prioritizes paperwork over questions, bureaucracy over speed, and process over results.

#### The Result

$500 per patient ([Manhattan Institute](https://manhattan.institute/article/slow-costly-clinical-trials-drag-down-biomedical-breakthroughs)) vs FDA's $41,000 per patient ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295430/)).

That's an 82x efficiency gain achieved by doing the obvious things in obvious ways.

Also, they saved a million lives ([PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8940185/)) by determining that steroids work on severe COVID within 100 days.

The FDA would still be in Phase II, asking for more funding.

##### The Implications: What RECOVERY Proved

The RECOVERY trial didn't just save lives, it proved several critical points about clinical research:

1. **Decentralization Works:** 186 hospitals operating independently produced better results than centralized control
2. **Real Patients Matter:** Including sick patients ([who FDA trials exclude](../references.qmd#fda-trial-patient-exclusion-criteria)) provides real-world evidence
3. **Speed Saves Lives:** First results in 100 days vs years for traditional trials
4. **Cost Is A Choice:** The 82x cost difference isn't about capability, it's about bureaucracy
5. **Scale Is Achievable:** 49,000 patients enrolled [faster than most FDA trials enroll 1,000](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-enrollment-timelines)
6. **Simplicity Wins:** [Three 1-page forms (consent, case report, follow-up) vs FDA's complex multi-form protocols](../references.qmd#fda-vs-oxford-paperwork). Less paperwork, more cures.

#### The Bottom Line Math

- RECOVERY: $50 per patient per answer (testing 10 treatments across 49,000 patients)
- FDA: $41,000 per patient, often testing just one treatment
- **That's an 820X efficiency gain when measuring cost per medical answer**

The lesson is clear: We already know how to run trials 82x more efficiently. The Oxford RECOVERY trial proved it works. The only question is whether we'll choose to implement this model globally or continue wasting $41,000 per patient while people die waiting for cures.

4. **Cost Efficiency**
   The actual cost of £2.1M (~$2.7M) for the entire trial represents an even more dramatic efficiency than previously estimated. While a simple division yields approximately £43 (~$55) per patient, authoritative sources cite ~$500 per patient as a more realistic figure ([Manhattan Institute](https://manhattan.institute/article/slow-costly-clinical-trials-drag-down-biomedical-breakthroughs)). This is nearly 80 times more cost-efficient than traditional clinical trials ([NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295430/): $41,000 per patient). This extraordinary cost-effectiveness, combined with the rapid delivery of results (three major findings within 100 days) and estimated global impact of over 1 million lives saved, demonstrates the revolutionary nature of the RECOVERY trial model.

## Proof This Isn't Insane

"But wait," you might say, "this sounds too good to be true. Has anyone actually proven that decentralized trials work better than the FDA's monopoly?"

Excellent question. Let me show you the proof.

### Oxford Already Achieved 82x Cost Reduction

### The Oxford RECOVERY Trial

**$500 vs FDA's $41,000 Per Patient**

The UK spent $500 per patient testing COVID treatments. Saved a million lives.

America spent $41,000 per patient on paperwork.

### The Math

- Current cost to develop a drug: [$2.2 billion](../references.qmd#post-1962-drug-costs-explode)
- New cost with decentralized pragmatic trials: ~$27 million
- Efficiency gain: ~82x (Oxford showed 82x reduction possible)
- Lives saved: Millions annually
- Legal lobbying budget: $1 billion
