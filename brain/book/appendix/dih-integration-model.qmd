### 5. Why This Works Better Than Direct Payments

#### Avoids Perverse Incentives

- No "professional patients" gaming the system
- No coercion of desperate people
- Maintains doctor-patient relationship
- Preserves medical ethics

#### Reduces Friction

- Works within existing workflows
- Uses familiar insurance model
- No new systems to learn
- Doctors remain gatekeepers

#### Ensures Quality

- Medical oversight maintained
- Safety monitoring preserved
- Professional standards upheld
- Data quality assured

## Real-World Example

### Sarah has Type 2 Diabetes

#### Old System

- Metformin not working well
- No other options covered
- Pays $500/month for branded drug
- Still has poor control

#### With DIH Integration

1. Doctor checks DIH portal during visit
2. Sees 5 relevant trials for new diabetes drugs
3. Recommends Trial #3 based on Sarah's profile
4. Sarah enrolls with one click
5. DIH covers all costs
6. Sarah pays $30 copay
7. Gets experimental drug that might work better
8. Reports blood sugar via app
9. Data helps next patient

## Implementation Requirements

### Technical Infrastructure

- EMR integration APIs
- Pharmacy network connections
- Claims processing system
- Patient portal/app
- Data collection platform

### Regulatory Framework

- Modified clinical trial regulations
- Insurance coordination rules
- Privacy/HIPAA compliance
- Prescription handling protocols
- Safety monitoring standards

### Who Gets What

- **Doctors:** CME credits for trial participation
- **Pharmacies:** Dispensing fees for trial meds
- **Hospitals:** Infrastructure payments
- **Insurers:** Reduced long-term costs from better treatments

## The Pre-1962 Model (The Model You're Reinstating)

Before the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendment:

- [Doctors could prescribe experimental treatments](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#pre-1962-physician-trials)
- Patients and doctors decided together
- Innovation happened at bedside
- [FDA only regulated safety, not efficacy](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#fda-pre-1962-mandate)

### You bring this model back, but with

- Modern safety monitoring
- Real-time data collection
- Systematic outcome tracking
- Global knowledge sharing
- Insurance coverage for trials

## Cost Structure (Realistic Numbers)

### Per Patient Per Trial

- Medication costs: $200-2000/month (covered by DIH)
- Monitoring costs: $100-500/month (covered by DIH)
- Travel/time: $50-200/month (covered by DIH)
- **Patient copay: $20-50/month**
- Data collection: $10/month (automated)

**Total DIH cost per patient:** $360-2,710/month
**Traditional trial cost per patient:** [$6,800-13,600/month](../../../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#trial-costs-fda-study)

#### Efficiency gain: 75-80% cost reduction

## Why Doctors Will Love This

1. **More treatment options** for desperate patients
2. **Professional satisfaction** from contributing to research
3. **CME credits** for participation
4. **No liability** (covered by trial insurance)
5. **Simple integration** (one click in EMR)
6. **Better outcomes** from expanded options

## Why Patients Will Use This

1. **Affordable access** to experimental treatments ($20-50 copay)
2. **Doctor recommended** (trusted source)
3. **Insurance-like coverage** (familiar model)
4. **No financial risk** (DIH covers everything)
5. **Helping others** while helping themselves

## The Transition Plan

### Phase 1: Pilot Programs (Year 1)

- 10 health systems
- 5 disease areas
- 10,000 patients
- Prove the model works

#### Phase 2: Regional Rollout (Year 2)

- 100 health systems
- 20 disease areas
- 100,000 patients
- Refine operations

##### Phase 3: National Scale (Year 3+)

- All willing providers
- All diseases
- Millions of patients
- Full integration

## Integration Strategy

The DIH isn't trying to replace the healthcare system. It's adding an "experimental treatment insurance layer" that:

- Works within existing infrastructure
- Respects current relationships
- Maintains safety standards
- Reduces costs dramatically
- Accelerates medical progress

It's not revolution. It's evolution. And it starts with a simple insurance card that says: "This covers your clinical trial participation."
