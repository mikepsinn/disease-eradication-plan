## Comparative Cost-Effectiveness: dFDA vs. Other Public Health Interventions

To provide context for the dFDA Infrastructure's impact, the chart below visualizes its cost-effectiveness against other well-understood public health programs. The metric used is **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) Gained per $1 Million of Spending**. A higher number signifies greater cost-effectiveness.

For standard interventions, this value is calculated as `$1,000,000 / ICER`, where the ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) is the cost to gain one QALY. For **dominant** interventions that are both more effective and less expensive, the ICER is negative, and this metric isn't strictly applicable. For these cases, an illustrative range is used to represent their high value.

All data used in the chart is derived from the table and sources below.

The following table provides the data and sources that support the chart. The list is ordered to match the chart's presentation.

### Methodology Notes

<a id="ref_chart_calc"></a>¹ **QALYs per $1M Calculation**:

- For interventions with positive ICERs: `1,000,000 / ICER`
- For the dFDA Infrastructure: `(Annual QALYs Gained) / (Annual Cost in Millions)`
- Ranges reflect conservative to optimistic scenarios accounting for parameter uncertainties

<a id="ref_dfda_icer"></a>² **Negative ICER Interpretation**:

- All dFDA scenarios show negative ICERs, indicating cost-saving while generating health benefits
- The platform is "dominant" - more effective and less costly than the status quo

<a id="ref_dominant"></a>³ **Dominant Interventions**:

- For cost-saving (dominant) interventions, standard QALY/$1M calculations are not applicable
- Values shown are illustrative to demonstrate relative cost-effectiveness
- Upper bounds represent the exceptional value of these interventions

### Data Limitations

- Historical interventions (e.g., smallpox) use retrospective analyses
- Direct comparisons between interventions should consider contextual differences
- All costs are in 2023 USD, adjusted using appropriate health inflation indices
- QALY calculations use standard health state utility weights where available

**Conclusion:** The dFDA initiative is not just a financially sound investment with a high ROI; it is one of the most impactful public health interventions conceivable. Its "dominant" cost-effectiveness profile is comparable to gold-standard programs like childhood vaccination and smoking cessation, but its scale of economic and health benefits is potentially orders of magnitude larger.

## Comparison to Other Major Public Investments

To provide context for the dFDA's estimated costs, it is useful to compare them to other significant U.S. government investments in health and technology. The dFDA's projected "Lean Ecosystem" cost of approximately **[\$40 million per year](#simplified-roi-scenario)** (covering core platform operations plus medium-scope broader initiatives) is modest in comparison to other major federal projects.

| **Cancer Moonshot Initiative**       | **[~\$257 Million / year](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget)** ($1.8B over 7 years)          | **~6.4x**                                | [21st Century Cures Act](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget)          |
| **NIH "All of Us" Research Program** | \*\*[~\$500 Million / year](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/budget) (FY23 Approx. Budget) | **~12.5x**                               | [NIH Budget](https://www.nih.gov/about-nih/what-we-do/budget)              |
| **HealthCare.gov (Initial Build)**   | **[~\$1.7 - \$2.1 Billion](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-07-49.pdf)** (Total Upfront Cost)        | **~42x - 52x** (of one year's dFDA cost) | [GAO Reports / Public Reporting](https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-07-49.pdf) |
| **National Cancer Institute (NCI)**  | **[~\$7.2 Billion / year](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget)** (FY25 Budget)                 | **~180x**                                | [NCI Budget Data](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/budget)                 |

**Key Takeaway:** The estimated annual cost of the dFDA initiative is an order of magnitude smaller than the budgets for other major national health priorities like the "All of Us" program or the Cancer Moonshot. It represents approximately **0.55%** of the NCI's annual budget (calculated from [dFDA annual cost](#simplified-roi-scenario) and [NCI budget](#comparison-to-other-major-public-investments)). This comparison underscores that the dFDA Infrastructure is not only a high-leverage investment (due to its massive ROI) but also a remarkably cost-effective one relative to the scale of federal health and technology spending.
