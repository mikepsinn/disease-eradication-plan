You're asking 280 million humans to answer one question. The difference between 65% yes and 75% yes is **280 million people** - larger than the population of Australia.

This is not the time to guess. This is the time to test everything.

## Question Variations to Test

### Variation 1: Simple Disparity Frame (Current Baseline)

> "Humanity currently spends 40 times more on military than on medical research. Should nations redirect 1% of military spending to help cure disease?"

#### Strengths

- Simple and clear
- Emotional hook (40x disparity)
- Specific ask (1%)
- Easy to understand

#### Weaknesses

- Doesn't address "but we need defense!" objection
- Misses efficiency angle
- Doesn't explain mechanism

**Target Audience:** General population, emotionally driven voters

### Variation 2: Security + Benefit Frame

> "If all nations simultaneously redirect 1% of military spending to medical research, you'd have 1% fewer weapons aimed at you and faster access to cures. Should your country participate?"

#### Strengths

- Addresses defense objection directly
- Positive sum framing ("more security AND health")
- Emphasizes simultaneity (removes free-rider concern)
- Personal benefit ("faster access")

#### Weaknesses

- Longer and more complex
- Requires understanding simultaneity concept
- "Weapons aimed at you" might seem alarmist

**Target Audience:** Defense hawks, national security voters, skeptics

### Variation 3: Efficiency Frame

> "New trial methods cost 82 times less than traditional approaches. Should nations redirect 1% of military spending to fund these breakthrough trials and accelerate cures?"

#### Strengths

- Highlights the killer fact (82x efficiency)
- Explains WHY it will work
- "Breakthrough" creates excitement
- Appeals to rational/analytical mindset

#### Weaknesses

- Requires believing the 82x claim
- Less emotional appeal
- Misses the 40x disparity context

**Target Audience:** Analytical voters, scientists, economists, skeptics

### Variation 4: Personal Benefit Frame

> "Should nations redirect 1% of military budgets to fund trials that could cure your disease, pay you to participate, and reduce global weapons by 1%?"

#### Strengths

- Direct personal benefit
- Payment incentive mentioned
- Security benefit included
- Action-oriented ("cure YOUR disease")

#### Weaknesses

- Longest version (comprehension cost)
- Multiple concepts (could dilute focus)
- "Pay you" might seem too transactional

**Target Audience:** Patients, health-conscious voters, economically motivated

### Variation 5: Ultra-Simple Control

> "Should your country redirect 1% of military spending to help cure disease?"

#### Strengths

- Shortest and clearest
- No complex concepts
- Direct and unambiguous
- Lowest cognitive load

#### Weaknesses

- No context (40x disparity)
- No mechanism explanation
- Doesn't address objections
- Less compelling

**Target Audience:** Low-engagement voters, mobile users, rapid scrollers

### Variation 6: Combined Security + Efficiency (Comprehensive)

> "Pragmatic trials integrated into standard healthcare cost 82x less than traditional methods. If all nations redirect just 1% of military spending to fund these trials, everyone gets 1% more security (fewer weapons pointed at you) and access to treatments years sooner. Should your country participate?"

#### Strengths

- Uses specific term from education ("pragmatic trials")
- Addresses all major points: efficiency + security + timing + benefit
- "Integrated into standard healthcare" emphasizes system replacement, not addition
- "Years sooner" more concrete than "faster"
- Emphasizes "just 1%" (small ask)
- Win-win framing
- Perfect summary for educated audiences

#### Weaknesses

- Longer (51 words) - requires engaged attention
- Multiple concepts - ONLY works after proper education
- Without education context, too complex for cold traffic
- May lose impatient mobile users who skip education

**Target Audience:** Educated voters who completed 5-10 minute educational modules

## Testing Framework

### Phase 1: Pilot Testing (Months 1-2)

**Sample Size:** 10,000 participants minimum per variation

#### Metrics to Track

- **Yes/No/Undecided rates**
- **Completion rate** (did they finish or bounce?)
- **Time to decision** (how long did they think?)
- **Share rate** (did they tell others?)
- **Demographic breakdown** (age, location, education)

#### Testing Method

- Randomly assign visitors to one of 6 variations
- Equal traffic split (16.7% each)
- Track using UTM parameters and cookies
- Run for 30 days minimum

### Phase 2: Refinement Testing (Months 3-4)

**Sample Size:** 50,000 participants

#### Method

- Take top 2-3 performing variations from Phase 1
- Create hybrid versions combining best elements
- Test head-to-head with larger sample
- Include geographic and demographic targeting

#### Advanced Testing

- Test question + context combinations
- Test different educational content before question
- Test with/without video explainers
- Test mobile vs desktop presentation

### Phase 3: Scale Testing (Months 5-6)

**Sample Size:** 100,000+ participants

#### Method

- Deploy winning variation globally
- Continue A/B testing minor optimizations
- Test localized translations
- Optimize for different cultural contexts

## Geographic and Cultural Variations

### For Defense-Skeptical Regions (Europe, Scandinavia)

Emphasize efficiency and healthcare benefits:
> "Medical trials can now be conducted 82x more efficiently. Should nations redirect 1% of military spending to fund these trials and accelerate cures?"

### For Security-Conscious Regions (US, Middle East, Eastern Europe)

Lead with security framing:
> "If all nations reduce military spending by 1% simultaneously, you'd have 1% fewer weapons aimed at you while gaining access to breakthrough medical treatments. Support this?"

### For Developing Nations (Africa, South Asia, Latin America)

Emphasize personal health benefits:
> "Should your country redirect 1% of military spending to fund medical trials that pay you to participate and could cure your disease?"

## Success Metrics

### Primary Metrics

- **Yes Vote Rate:** Target >75%
- **Completion Rate:** Target >85%
- **Viral Coefficient:** Target >1.2 (each person recruits 1.2+ others)

### Secondary Metrics

- **Share Rate:** % who share on social media
- **Referral Count:** Average referrals per participant
- **Time on Page:** Indicator of engagement
- **Return Rate:** % who come back with friends

## Educational Flow Before The Question

**Critical Insight:** The comprehensive question works BECAUSE of proper education. The flow is:

### Recommended Educational Sequence (5-10 minutes)

#### Module 1: The Crisis (2 minutes)

- 150,000 daily deaths from curable diseases
- 40x military vs medical research spending disparity
- Visual: Chart showing the spending gap
- Emotional hook: "Every 3.5 minutes while you read this, someone dies from a preventable disease"

**Module 2: The Solution - Pragmatic Trials (3 minutes)**

- **What:** Real-world trials that cost 82x less than traditional FDA trials
- **Evidence:** RECOVERY trial case study
  - 40,000 patients
  - $500/patient (vs $41,000 traditional)
  - 6 treatments tested simultaneously
  - Discovered dexamethasone saves 1 in 8 COVID patients

- **Video:** 90-second explainer showing how pragmatic trials work
- **Key Insight:** This isn't theoretical - Oxford already proved it works at scale

**Module 3: The Mechanism - 1% Treaty (2 minutes)**

- All nations redirect 1% simultaneously
- $27 billion annually to fund trials
- **Security benefit:** Your enemies have 1% fewer weapons aimed at you
- Balance of power unchanged, but everyone safer AND healthier
- Visual: Interactive diagram showing simultaneous reduction

##### Module 4: Your Benefits (1 minute)

- Access to cutting-edge treatments
- Get paid to participate in trials
- Help determine which research gets funded
- Be part of the 3.5% that changes history

###### Module 5: The Question (Decision moment)

- **NOW** present the comprehensive question
- It's not introducing new concepts - it's summarizing what they just learned
- Each element in the question triggers recall of the educational modules

### Why This Sequence Works

1. **Emotional → Logical → Personal:** Start with the problem (emotional), explain the solution (logical), show personal benefit (motivating)
2. **Proof-first:** Lead with RECOVERY trial evidence before asking for belief
3. **Objection handling:** Address "but we need defense!" before they can think it
4. **Progressive commitment:** Each module gets a micro-commitment (scroll, watch video, click "learn more")
5. **Summary question:** The comprehensive question reinforces learning, doesn't introduce it

### A/B Test: Education Length

| Version | Length | Content | Expected Result |
|---------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Short | 2 min | Video only + simple question | 70% yes, high share rate |
| Medium | 5 min | Video + key stats + comprehensive question | 80% yes, good share rate |
| Long | 10 min | Full modules + interactive + comprehensive question | 85% yes, lower share rate |
| None | 0 min | Just the question (cold traffic) | 50% yes, high bounce rate |

**Optimal:** Medium (5 minutes) with comprehensive question provides best balance of education depth and conversion.

## Implementation Recommendations

### Best Practices for Testing

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with Variation 1 (current) vs Variation 5 (ultra-simple)
2. **Add Complexity Gradually:** Test adding efficiency or security angles
3. **Test Context Separately:** Question alone vs question + education
4. **Localize Everything:** Translate and culturally adapt for each region
5. **Mobile-First:** Optimize for smartphone display first

### Red Flags to Watch For

- **Completion rate <70%:** Question too complex or intimidating
- **Time to decision >30 seconds:** Cognitive overload or confusion
- **Share rate <5%:** Not compelling enough to spread
- **Demographic skew:** Missing key populations (adjust targeting)

## Recommended Question for Launch

**Based on strategic analysis, recommend Variation 6 (Comprehensive) for educated audiences:**

> "Pragmatic trials integrated into standard healthcare cost 82x less than traditional methods. If all nations redirect just 1% of military spending to fund these trials, everyone gets 1% more security (fewer weapons pointed at you) and access to treatments years sooner. Should your country participate?"

### Rationale

1. **Education context:** By the time users see this question, they've already gone through 5-10 minutes of education explaining pragmatic trials, the 82x efficiency, RECOVERY trial case study, and security benefits. The question serves as a summary and reinforcement.
2. **"Pragmatic trials integrated into standard healthcare":** Uses the specific term they learned in Module 2 and emphasizes the key innovation, this replaces broken traditional trials with efficient trials built into normal healthcare
3. **Credibility through specificity:** The 82x number provides concrete evidence this isn't magical thinking
4. **"Treatments years sooner":** More concrete than "faster cures"—reinforces the timing comparison from Module 2 (months vs years)
5. **"1% more security":** Reframes defense objection as a benefit, you get MORE security with fewer weapons
6. **Multiple benefit stacking:** Efficiency + security + timing + participation
7. **Clear call to action:** "Should your country participate?" creates ownership

**Critical Success Factor:** This comprehensive question REQUIRES proper education before voting. Without context, it's too complex. With education, it's perfect reinforcement.

**Fallback for cold traffic:** If someone arrives without education, use Variation 1 (simple 40x disparity frame) and require them to go through education before final vote.

## Testing Budget

**Phase 1 (Pilot):** $50,000

- Traffic acquisition: $30,000
- Testing infrastructure: $10,000
- Analysis tools: $10,000

**Phase 2 (Refinement):** $100,000

- Larger sample traffic: $70,000
- Advanced analytics: $20,000
- Geographic targeting: $10,000

**Phase 3 (Scale):** $50,000

- Ongoing optimization: $30,000
- Translation/localization: $20,000

**Total Testing Budget:** $200,000 (0.02% of $1B total campaign budget)

**Expected ROI:** 5-10% improvement in yes-vote rate = 14-28M additional supporters = priceless

## Question Evolution Over Time

### Early Adopters (First 10M)

Use comprehensive framing with full context. These are your evangelists.

#### Early Majority (Next 100M)

Optimize for simplicity and shareability. Focus on viral growth.

#### Late Majority (Next 100M)

Emphasize social proof ("180M people already said yes"). Herd behavior.

#### Laggards (Final 70M)

Direct benefit messaging. "Join now or miss out on trial access."

## Final Note: The Question Will Evolve

This isn't "pick one and done." The question that gets the first 10 million supporters might not be the question that gets the last 70 million.

As social proof builds, your question should shift from "Should this be done?" to "Will you join the millions who already agree?"

The testing never stops. Every 10 million participants, re-evaluate. What worked at 100M might not work at 200M.

Stay flexible. Follow the data. Get to 280M.
