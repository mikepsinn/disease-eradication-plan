The classic "free-rider" objection to any global treaty is valid: "Why should we comply if our rivals won't?"

Traditional solutions, sanctions, trade restrictions, diplomatic pressure, fail consistently. Why? Because they're built on a flawed premise that ignores [Public Choice Theory](../references.qmd#james-buchanan-nobel-prize-1986):

**Nations don't make decisions. Self-interested individuals do.**

Traditional enforcement punishes "the nation" with diffuse, long-term costs (e.g., slightly higher tariffs on imports).

But the political leader making the decision doesn't care about diffuse, long-term costs to other people. They care about concentrated, short-term benefits to themselves (e.g., campaign donations from the military lobby).

This is why sanctions don't work. You're punishing the wrong entity.

### The Strategy

Ignore the abstract "nation." Instead, bribe the handful of individual leaders whose decisions actually matter.

Make compliance more profitable than opposition. For them personally.

## On Making Compliance the Most Profitable Personal Decision

The enforcement mechanism is not punishment. Punishment doesn't work on rational actors who can deflect costs to others.

The enforcement mechanism is **a bribe so large that compliance becomes the single most profitable choice for every key actor.**

You analyze the system as a marketplace of rational actors and offer a mathematically superior deal.

Here's the bribe:

### 1. The Bribe for Political Leaders (The Executive & Legislature)

A head of state or key legislator's primary goals are political survival and personal enrichment. The incentives are designed to serve both.

- **Overwhelming Political Power:** Create legally-compliant, independent expenditure vehicles in their jurisdiction. If a leader supports the treaty, fund a massive, professionally-run campaign to ensure their re-election and praise them for delivering unprecedented health benefits to their constituents. If they oppose the treaty, fund their primary challenger with an even larger sum, making opposition an act of political suicide.
- **Direct Personal Wealth:** Offer leaders, their families, and their key financial backers preferential access to **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**, which are engineered to deliver a >271.8%/year, a return that dwarfs the gains from any defense stock or traditional form of political graft.
- **Pork-Barrel Politics on a Global Scale:** The [DIH](../solution/dih.qmd) treasury represents a new, multi-billion dollar funding source. Compliant leaders gain significant influence over directing DIH research grants and infrastructure projects to their home districts and allied institutions, allowing them to reward their supporters on a massive scale.

### 2. The Bribe for the Military-Industrial Complex (The Generals & CEOs)

This group's primary goal is profit and influence. Don't fight them; co-opt them by offering a more profitable business model.

- **Become a Peace Contractor:** The DIH will become the world's largest funder of high-tech logistics, cybersecurity, and advanced manufacturing. Defense contractors can pivot and bid on these lucrative, long-term contracts to build the infrastructure for a global decentralized trial network.
- **Superior, De-Risked Returns:** Invite the boards and executives of these firms to personally invest in VICTORY Bonds, showing them a clear mathematical path to greater personal wealth through the system's success.
- **Self-Preservation:** Their families get cancer, too. Make it clear that a small redirection of their business from a [1% cut in military hardware](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) to the mission of curing disease is a rational choice for their own long-term health and security.

### 3. The Bribe for the Financial Elite (The Bankers & Fund Managers)

This group's primary goal is sourcing high-return, low-risk investment opportunities. The system provides the best one in the world.

- **Alpha-Generating Returns:** VICTORY Bonds are designed to outperform every other asset class, making them an essential holding for any sovereign wealth fund, pension fund, or institutional investor in a compliant nation.
- **De-Risked by Design:** The use of assurance contracts for initial funding rounds and the backing of a multi-trillion dollar "peace dividend" makes this a uniquely secure investment.
- **Economic Stability:** A healthier global population is a more productive one. The secondary economic effects of the DIH's success, reduced healthcare burdens, increased productivity, greater social stability, create a better macro environment for their entire portfolio.

## The "Punishment": Targeted, Personal, and Financial

The approach to non-compliance is not to sanction a country. It is to ensure that the specific **individuals** who block the treaty lose money and power.

- If a politician opposes the treaty, don't lobby them; **fund their opponent.**
- If a defense contractor lobbies against the treaty, don't argue with them; **fund their competitors** who have embraced the "Peace Contractor" model.
- If a financier actively works against the initiative, don't blacklist their firm; use market intelligence to show how their opposition is a poor long-term bet, creating **pressure from their own investors.**

By correctly diagnosing the free-rider problem as a failure of individual incentives, the solution becomes clear. There's no need for a world police; just make peace and health a more profitable business than war and disease for the people who matter.
