## Assumptions

### Participation and Data Infrastructure

- At least 1 billion people worldwide opt in to share health data in anonymized form.
- Medical records and wearable data are interoperable and standardized sufficiently to be aggregated globally.
- Robust data security and privacy technologies are in place to comply with international regulations (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).

### Cost Reductions

#### Decentralized trial costs modeled on Oxford RECOVERY

- Decentralized trial costs drop closer to the [Oxford RECOVERY model](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-cost-reduction): from an average of [\$40,000 - \$120,000 per patient](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-cost-per-patient) in traditional Phase III trials to roughly **\$500 - \$1,000 per patient**.
- Regulatory oversight is streamlined through a continuous data audit system, reducing substantial administrative overhead.

### Technical Feasibility

- The necessary digital infrastructure (electronic health records, secure data exchange protocols, machine learning analytics, etc.) is assumed to be widely adopted.
- Some advanced technologies (e.g., blockchain, federated learning) achieve maturity to ensure data integrity and patient privacy.

### Funding and Governance

- Start-up costs may be shared by governments, philanthropic organizations, and industry.
- Ongoing operational costs are partially offset by reduced labor needs for conventional site-based trials and by subscription or service models from industry sponsors using the platform.

These assumptions set a stage where the platform can indeed function at scale, but this remains a forward-looking scenario.
