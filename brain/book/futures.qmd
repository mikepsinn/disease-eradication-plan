Two timelines diverge from this moment. Same planet, same technology, opposite destinies. The only variable is a 1% budget reallocation.

## Path A: Idiocracy

We continue on our current path. The smartest minds are drawn to the ever-growing dark economy of cybercrime and AI-driven conflict. The singularity happens, but it's an inverse one, a hockey stick pointing straight down. Global systems collapse, antibiotics fail, and the average lifespan plummets. Warlords with AI armies fight over the scraps in a radioactive wasteland. Earth's final epitaph: "They had magic but chose madness."

## Path B: Wishonia

We pass the 1% Treaty. The brightest minds and most powerful technologies are redirected from destruction to creation. The feedback loop is immediate: more funding leads to more cures, which leads to more public support for more funding. By 2040, aging is reversible, suffering is optional, and scarcity is a memory. By 2050, we have cured death, solved physics, and are planning our expansion into the galaxy.

## The Only Variable

Same species.
Same year.
Same technology.
The only difference: One 1% budget reallocation.
