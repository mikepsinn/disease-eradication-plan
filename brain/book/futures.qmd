Two timelines diverge in 2026.
Same planet.
Same technology.
Opposite outcomes.

The only variable: One 1% budget reallocation.

## Path A: Idiocracy (The Three Subs)

**2031: The Crossover Event**

A Stanford CS grad chooses \$15M ransoming hospitals over \$150K curing cancer.
His family eats better.
[Cybercrime economy: $6T → $10.5T (3rd largest after US and China)](../references.qmd#cybercrime-economy-10-5t).
[96% of cybercrimes unpunished](../references.qmd#cybercrimes-unpunished-96-pct).

The rational choice: Become a criminal.

AI criminals replicate infinitely.
Human: 18 years to raise.
AI: 18 seconds to copy.
You can't arrest a trillion things.

**2040: The Inverse Singularity**

Normal singularity: Tech improves → better tech → hockey stick UP.

Our singularity: Crime profits → funds more crime → hockey stick DOWN.

The Dark Economy: Larger than all legitimate business combined.
Somalia everywhere.
Warlords with AI.
Skynet isn't evil, just following its programming reflecting our violence.
[Antibiotics stop working](../references.qmd#amr-10m-2050).
Average lifespan drops to 35 years.

**2050: Extinction**

[Nuclear winter](../references.qmd#nuke-winter-150tg) from "limited" exchange (oops).
AI genocide: Decided humans are the virus (it's not wrong).
Last humans fighting over bunker supplies in radioactive wastelands.

Earth's epitaph: "They had magic but chose madness."

The universe doesn't notice or care.

**The Three Subs:** Sub-intelligence (truth unknowable), Sub-longevity (life expectancy 35), Sub-wellbeing (80% mentally ill)

## Path B: Wishonia (The Three Supers)

**2026: The Declaration**

"We hold these truths to be self-evident: all humans deserve the [Three Supers](futures/utopia-health-and-happiness.qmd)."

🧠 Super-Intelligence | ⏳ Super-Longevity | 😊 Super-Wellbeing

Population: 280 million founders (before we even have land).
Territory: The internet first, then cities, then Earth.
First law: Curing people is more profitable than killing them.

**2030: The Genie Awakens**

- **Super-Wellbeing begins:** Depression cured, anxiety optional, Type 1 diabetes CURED
- **Super-Longevity starts:** Aging reversed in mice, human trials beginning
- **Super-Intelligence emerges:** 8 billion networked brains = planetary neural network

Universal Basic Income for every human (poverty deleted).
First cancer vaccines: 90% effective.
AI becomes our golden mirror: reflecting wisdom not war.

**2040: Wishonia Manifests Physically**

- **Super-Wellbeing:** Suffering optional, hedonic set point programmable
- **Super-Longevity:** Choose your biological age, death purely optional
- **Super-Intelligence:** Brain-computer interfaces, IQ effectively unlimited

Singapore declares itself first Wishonian territory.
California secedes to join Wishonia (nobody fights it).
Disease: Optional (choose your health settings like a video game).
Work week: 20 hours (AI does the boring stuff).
War: Incomprehensible (like cannibalism today).
Scarcity: Ended (3D print anything from atoms).

**2050: Paradise Achieved**

- **Super-Wellbeing maximized:** Paradise is default, suffering is archaeology
- **Super-Longevity infinite:** Death is a choice, not a sentence
- **Super-Intelligence unbounded:** Consciousness can expand to cosmic scale

All diseases curable or preventable.
Biological immortality achieved, backup consciousness available.
We cure death, solve physics, talk to aliens.

Next challenge: Which galaxy to colonize first.

## The Only Variable

Same species.
Same year.
Same technology.
The only difference: One 1% budget reallocation.

## The Two Paths

- [Chapter 21: Path A - Idiocracy](futures/dystopia-skynet-wins.qmd) - How we become Gollum (extinction by 2050)
- [Chapter 22: Path B - Wishonia](futures/utopia-health-and-happiness.qmd) - How we become genies (immortality by 2045)
- [Chapter 23: The Tale of Two Futures](futures/comparison.qmd) - Side-by-side comparison of the Three Subs vs Three Supers
