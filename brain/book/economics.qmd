Depending on what you count, the 1% Treaty generates between 463:1 and 25,781:1 ROI:

**463:1 = Conservative (dFDA R&D Savings Only)**

- Only counts the $50.0B in annual R&D cost reductions from 82x cheaper trials
- Ignores peace dividend, earlier access, and all secondary benefits
- NPV-based, 10-year timeframe
- This is the floor

**1,239:1 = Complete (All Direct Benefits)**

- Counts all 8 primary benefit categories totaling $1.2T/year
- Includes peace dividend, R&D savings, earlier access, research acceleration, rare diseases, drug prices, prevention, and mental health
- 10-year average
- This is the realistic case

**25,781:1 = Endgame (Year 20 Compounding)**

- Adds all secondary multiplier effects: productivity gains, global trade, infrastructure preservation, avoided crises, innovation acceleration
- Reaches $16.4T annual value at maturity
- This is where we're actually headed

### Which one should you cite?

- Conservative audience: Use 463:1
- Complete pitch: Use 1,239:1
- True believers: Use 25,781:1

All three are correct. They just count different things.

## The Conservative Case: 463:1 ROI (dFDA Only)

If you ONLY count the cheapest, most conservative benefit, making clinical trials 82x cheaper, here's what you get:

### The Numbers

All calculations are in the [Economic Models Notebook](./economics/economic_models.ipynb).

#### The Funding Source (Peace Dividend)

- **Captured Dividend**: 1% of global military spending = **$27.2B annually** to fund the initiative
- **Societal Dividend**: Same 1% reduction generates **$113.6B in annual economic value** through decreased conflict costs

#### The Investment (dFDA Infrastructure)

- **Total Cost (NPV)**: 10-year discounted cost to build and operate = **$538M**
- **Funding Sustainability**: Annual captured dividend ($27.2B) covers annual operational cost ($40M) **680 times over**

#### The Return (Health & Wealth)

- **Economic Return (NPV)**: 10-year discounted net benefit = **$249.3B** in R&D savings alone
- **Robust ROI**: $249.3B / $538M = **463:1**
- **Health Return**: **840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** annually

**Bottom Line**: The treaty takes 1% of what humanity spends on bombs and redirects it to cure diseases instead. This creates two massive, independent wins:

1. **The Peace Dividend**: Society gets **113.6B** richer every year from slightly less conflict
2. **The dFDA Bonus**: You use a fraction of that dividend to unlock **$50.0B** in R&D savings annually, plus 840,000 years of healthy life

##### Total Annual Benefit: ~$163.6B per year.

*Even in worst-case scenarios, the system achieves ROI between **189:1 and 1,281:1**.*

### This ROI in Historical Context

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves **463:1 return on investment**.

This exceptional ROI comes from:

- **$50.0B in annual R&D cost savings**: 82x reduction in clinical trial costs
- **Faster access to new treatments**: 2 years instead of 17 years to market
- **Better prevention through real-world data**: Continuous learning from millions of patients
- **Enabling new therapies**: Making rare disease trials economically viable

{{< include ../figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

Comparison to historical public health achievements:

- Smallpox eradication: 280:1
- Childhood vaccinations: 13:1
- Water fluoridation: 23:1

### Infinite ROI When Funded by Military Redirection

{{< include ../figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

When funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**.

**Why the ROI is literally infinite** ([see full calculation](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)):

- **Zero net cost**: The $27.2B comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **$163.6B in annual benefits**: Peace dividend ($113.6B) + R&D savings ($50.0B)
- **Operating costs**: Only $290M/year (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: 26,446/year (925,610 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **The math**: $163.6B benefit ÷ $0 new spending = ∞ (infinite ROI)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS `${python} f"{abs(COST_PER_LIFE_INVESTOR_FUNDED):.2f}"` million instead of spending

This is a **dominant health intervention**: it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives.

Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates $163.6B annually while saving 26,446 lives.

## The Complete Case: 1,239:1 ROI (All Direct Benefits)

The conservative 463:1 calculation only counts dFDA R&D savings. But the 1% Treaty does much more.

### $1.2T in Annual Benefits

When you count all eight primary benefit categories:

1. **Peace dividend** (113.6B) - Societal savings from 1% less conflict
2. **R&D cost savings** ($50.0B) - 82x cheaper trials
3. **7-year access acceleration** ($300.0B) - Earlier treatment access during trials
4. **Research acceleration** ($100.0B) - 115X more research capacity (10-20X more breakthroughs)
5. **Rare disease treatments** ($400.0B) - Economically viable orphan drug development
6. **Drug price reductions** ($100.0B) - R&D savings passed to consumers
7. **Prevention medicine** ($100.0B) - Economically viable prevention trials
8. **Mental health** ($75.0B) - Closing the treatment gap

**Total: $1.2T/year in quantifiable benefits = 1,239:1 ROI**

The two largest contributors—**earlier access acceleration** and **research capacity expansion**—are often misunderstood as the same thing. They're not:

- **Earlier Access** = Patients access the SAME treatments 7 years sooner (during trials instead of post-approval)
- **Research Acceleration** = System runs 115X MORE trials, finding 10-20X MORE breakthroughs

Both are conservative estimates based on proven models (RECOVERY trial costs, disease prevalence data, standard QALY valuations).

**For detailed analysis including the 7-year access model, research capacity calculations, benefit breakdown table, and sanity checks**, see [1% Treaty ROI Tiers - Detailed Analysis](appendix/1-percent-treaty-roi-tiers.qmd).

## How This Compares to History

### Better Than the Best Charities

Here's how it compares to the most effective charities in the world (GiveWell top charities):

| Intervention | Cost to Achieve Outcome | This Initiative's Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GiveWell Top Charities** (e.g., Against Malaria Foundation) | Spend **~`${python} f'${GIVEWELL_COST_PER_LIFE_MIN:,.0f} - ${GIVEWELL_COST_PER_LIFE_MAX:,.0f}'`** to save one life | Generate **840,000 QALYs** annually while creating **$249.3B** in net economic value |

**The Difference**: GiveWell's charities are the best ways to spend money to save lives. They cost money but save lives very efficiently.

This plan doesn't cost money, it *makes* money while saving lives. Instead of asking people to donate, it makes everyone richer while curing diseases.

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend `${python} f'${GIVEWELL_COST_PER_LIFE_MIN:,.0f}-${GIVEWELL_COST_PER_LIFE_MAX:,.0f}'` to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society `${python} f'${abs(COST_PER_LIFE_INVESTOR_FUNDED):.2f}'` million per life saved**.

### Better Than History's Best Public Health Wins

| Intervention | How it Creates Value | Scale of Annual Net Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Childhood Vaccinations** | Prevents immense long-term treatment costs for diseases like measles and polio | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Smoking Cessation** | Prevents expensive chronic diseases (cancer, heart disease) through low-cost interventions | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Water Fluoridation** | Avoids dental care costs for entire populations at negligible cost | Hundreds of Millions to Billions |
| **1% Treaty (Peace Dividend)** | Reduces global conflict costs by 1%, creating massive economic benefit | **~113.6B, Annually** |
| **dFDA (R&D Efficiency)** | Makes clinical research ~82}x more efficient, unlocking huge R&D savings | **~$50.0B, Annually** |

#### Why This Is Different

Vaccines and smoking cessation programs are amazing, they solve specific problems with a high return.

The 1% Treaty and dFDA initiative tackles two problems at once:

1. **The Peace Dividend** is a massive economic gain on par with the largest public health wins, created simply by reducing a global negative (conflict)
2. **The dFDA** then uses a tiny fraction of that gain to fix the *system* of medical research, generating a *second* massive win

Instead of solving one problem, this uses a global-scale win to fund a system-scale win. When you redirect the world's largest source of waste to fund its most impactful opportunity, the math gets wild.

### 10X Bigger Than Childhood Vaccinations

{{< include ../figures/health-programs-vs-1-percent-treaty-societal-benefits-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The $163.6B annual economic benefit (conservative case) makes this intervention nearly **10 larger than childhood vaccinations** (one of the most successful public health programs in history).

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors 271.8% annual returns.

## The Opportunity Cost Clock

Every second we don't implement this system:

- **`${python} f'${ENDGAME_BENEFIT_PER_SECOND:,.0f}'`** in value destroyed
- **0.0 quality life-days** lost
- **1.736 preventable deaths** occur

By the time you finish reading this sentence, we've lost roughly $2M.

Every day we delay:

- **$44.8B** in potential value evaporates
- **150,000** people die who could have been saved
- **150,000** suffer from curable diseases
- **Your personal risk** of preventable death increases

Every year we wait is $16.4T lit on fire.
Every day is $44.8B wasted.
Every hour is $1.9B gone.

The $16.4T isn't a dream. It's the mathematical consequence of redirecting humanity's resources from destruction to construction, from killing to curing, from war to wellness.

## How to Fund It: VICTORY Bonds

The details are in [VICTORY Bonds](economics/victory-bonds.qmd), but here's the pitch:

- **271.8% annual returns** (perpetual)
- Funded by 10% of the $27.2B annual treaty revenue
- Makes investors richer than any hedge fund in history
- Generates the $1.0B needed to win the global referendum

## Who Benefits: The Coalition That Wins

See [The Coalition That Ends War](economics/coalition-that-wins.qmd) for the complete breakdown of how to co-opt:

- Defense contractors (pivot to medical R&D)
- Pharma companies (10X more customers at 1/82} of the cost)
- Insurance companies (healthier customers = higher profits)
- Politicians (visible results = re-election)
- Investors (271.8% returns)
- Patients (access to treatments)
- Taxpayers (lower healthcare costs)

## The Choice

Humanity can keep spending $118.8T on war and disease.
Or it can make between $163.6B and $16.4T per year ending both.

The ROI ranges from 463:1 to 25,781:1, depending on what you count.
