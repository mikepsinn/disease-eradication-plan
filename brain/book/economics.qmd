## The Numbers

### ∞ ROI (Literally Infinite)

The math is third-grade division:

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Annual Benefits}}{\text{New Spending}} = \frac{\$163.6\text{B}}{0} = \infty$$

**Why it's infinite:** The treaty redirects money that's already being spent on killing people to cure them instead. Zero new cost, $163.6B in annual benefits.

### Three Ways to Count the Returns

Depending on what you count, the 1% Treaty generates between 463:1 and 25,781:1 ROI:

**463:1 = Conservative (dFDA R&D Savings Only)**

- Only counts the $50.0B in annual R&D cost reductions from 82x cheaper trials
- Ignores peace dividend, earlier access, and all secondary benefits
- NPV-based, 10-year timeframe
- This is the floor

**1,239:1 = Complete (All Direct Benefits)**

- Counts all 8 primary benefit categories totaling $1.2T/year
- Includes peace dividend, R&D savings, earlier access, research acceleration, rare diseases, drug prices, prevention, and mental health
- 10-year average
- This is the realistic case

**25,781:1 = Endgame (Year 20 Compounding)**

- Adds all secondary multiplier effects: productivity gains, global trade, infrastructure preservation, avoided crises, innovation acceleration
- Reaches $16.4T annual value at maturity
- This is where we're actually headed

### Which one should you cite?

- Conservative audience: Use 463:1
- Complete pitch: Use 1,239:1
- True believers: Use 25,781:1

All three are correct. They just count different things.

## The Conservative Case: 463:1 ROI (dFDA Only)

If you ONLY count the cheapest, most conservative benefit, making clinical trials 82x cheaper, here's what you get:

### The Numbers

All calculations are in the [Economic Models Notebook](./economics/economic_models.ipynb).

#### The Funding Source (Peace Dividend)

- **Captured Dividend**: 1% of global military spending = **$27.2B annually** to fund the initiative
- **Societal Dividend**: Same 1% reduction generates **$113.6B in annual economic value** through decreased conflict costs

#### The Investment (dFDA Infrastructure)

- **Total Cost (NPV)**: 10-year discounted cost to build and operate = **$538M**
- **Funding Sustainability**: Annual captured dividend ($27.2B) covers annual operational cost ($40M) **680 times over**

#### The Return (Health & Wealth)

- **Economic Return (NPV)**: 10-year discounted net benefit = **$249.3B** in R&D savings alone
- **Robust ROI**: $249.3B / $538M = **463:1**
- **Health Return**: **840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** annually

**Bottom Line**: The treaty takes 1% of what humanity spends on bombs and redirects it to cure diseases instead. This creates two massive, independent wins:

1. **The Peace Dividend**: Society gets **113.6B** richer every year from slightly less conflict
2. **The dFDA Bonus**: You use a fraction of that dividend to unlock **$50.0B** in R&D savings annually, plus 840,000 years of healthy life

##### Total Annual Benefit: ~$163.6B per year.

*Even in worst-case scenarios, the system achieves ROI between **189:1 and 1,281:1**.*

### Saves $6.56 Million Per Life

**The only health intervention that generates wealth:**

- **Malaria Nets**: Cost $3,500 per life saved (excellent charity)
- **Deworming**: Cost $5,500 per life saved (great value)
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: SAVES $6,560,000 per life saved (you read that right)

This is a **dominant intervention** - it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives. No trade-off. No charity needed. Pure profit from preventing death.

### This ROI in Historical Context

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves **463:1 return on investment**.

This exceptional ROI comes from:

- **$50.0B in annual R&D cost savings**: 82x reduction in clinical trial costs
- **Faster access to new treatments**: 2 years instead of 17 years to market
- **Better prevention through real-world data**: Continuous learning from millions of patients
- **Enabling new therapies**: Making rare disease trials economically viable

{{< include ../figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

Comparison to historical public health achievements:

- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: 463:1 ROI
- **Smallpox eradication**: 280:1 ROI (previous record holder)
- **Childhood vaccinations**: 13:1 ROI
- **Water fluoridation**: 23:1 ROI
- **Average pharma drug**: 2:1 ROI

### Infinite ROI When Funded by Military Redirection

{{< include ../figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

When funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**.

**Why the ROI is literally infinite** ([see full calculation](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)):

- **Zero net cost**: The $27.2B comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **$163.6B in annual benefits**: Peace dividend ($113.6B) + R&D savings ($50.0B)
- **Operating costs**: Only $290M/year (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: 26,446/year (925,610 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **The math**: $163.6B benefit ÷ $0 new spending = ∞ (infinite ROI)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS **`{python} cost_per_life_investor_funded_formatted`** instead of spending

This is a **dominant health intervention**: it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives.

Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates $163.6B annually while saving 26,446 lives.

## The Complete Case: 1,239:1 ROI (All Direct Benefits)

The conservative 463:1 calculation only counts dFDA R&D savings. But the 1% Treaty does much more.

### $1.2T in Annual Benefits

When you count all eight primary benefit categories:

1. **Peace dividend** (113.6B) - Societal savings from 1% less conflict
2. **R&D cost savings** ($50.0B) - 82x cheaper trials
3. **7-year access acceleration** ($300.0B) - Earlier treatment access during trials
4. **Research acceleration** ($100.0B) - 115X more research capacity (10-20X more breakthroughs)
5. **Rare disease treatments** ($400.0B) - Economically viable orphan drug development
6. **Drug price reductions** ($100.0B) - R&D savings passed to consumers
7. **Prevention medicine** ($100.0B) - Economically viable prevention trials
8. **Mental health** ($75.0B) - Closing the treatment gap

**Total: $1.2T/year in quantifiable benefits = 1,239:1 ROI**

The two largest contributors—**earlier access acceleration** and **research capacity expansion**—are often misunderstood as the same thing. They're not:

- **Earlier Access** = Patients access the SAME treatments 7 years sooner (during trials instead of post-approval)
- **Research Acceleration** = System runs 115X MORE trials, finding 10-20X MORE breakthroughs

Both are conservative estimates based on proven models (RECOVERY trial costs, disease prevalence data, standard QALY valuations).

**For detailed analysis including the 7-year access model, research capacity calculations, benefit breakdown table, and sanity checks**, see [Research Acceleration Model - Detailed Analysis](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd).

## Why Every Other "World-Changing" Idea Is Inferior

### Universal Basic Income

- **Cost**: $3 trillion annually
- **ROI**: Negative (pure expense)
- **Lives saved**: Zero
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: GENERATES $163.6B while saving 25,000 lives

### Mars Colonization

- **Cost**: $500 billion minimum
- **ROI**: Unknown, probably negative for decades
- **Lives saved on Earth**: Zero
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: Pays for itself immediately, helps everyone TODAY

### Climate Technology

- **Cost**: $5-10 trillion needed
- **ROI**: Prevents future losses (important but not profitable)
- **Timeline**: Benefits in 50+ years
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: Profitable year one, compounds forever

### Artificial General Intelligence

- **Cost**: Unknown, potentially infinite
- **Risk**: Might kill everyone
- **Timeline**: Unknown
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: Uses existing tech, zero extinction risk

### Universal Healthcare

- **Cost**: $34 trillion over 10 years (US alone)
- **ROI**: Negative (requires constant funding)
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: Self-funding through efficiency gains

## The Problem This Solves

### The $119 Trillion Death Machine

Every year humanity wastes:

- **[$2.7 trillion](references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)** on weapons (40X more than medical research)
- **$8.2 trillion** treating disease symptoms (not curing them)
- **[$109 trillion](references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t)** in economic losses from disease burden
- **Total**: $119.8 trillion annually on death and suffering

Meanwhile:

- Medical research: [$68 billion](references.qmd#global-gov-med-research-spending) (0.057% of the problem)
- Success rate at curing diseases: 0% for 50 years
- Your chance of dying from disease: 100%

{{< include ../figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-1-percent-treaty-column-chart.qmd >}}

### The Daily Mathematics

![Annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](../../assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)

**[150,000 people die every day](references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)** from preventable/curable diseases. That's:

- 50 September 11ths daily
- 18,274 September 11ths annually
- A Holocaust every 40 days

Most species discover medicine before nuclear weapons. Earth did the opposite, which explains the current allocation.

## How This Compares to History

### Better Than the Best Charities

Here's how it compares to the most effective charities in the world (GiveWell top charities):

| Intervention | Cost to Achieve Outcome | This Initiative's Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GiveWell Top Charities** (e.g., Against Malaria Foundation) | Spend **~`{python} givewell_cost_per_life_min_formatted` - `{python} givewell_cost_per_life_max_formatted`** to save one life | Generate **840,000 QALYs** annually while creating **$249.3B** in net economic value |

**The Difference**: GiveWell's charities are the best ways to spend money to save lives. They cost money but save lives very efficiently.

This plan doesn't cost money, it *makes* money while saving lives. Instead of asking people to donate, it makes everyone richer while curing diseases.

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend `{python} givewell_cost_per_life_min_formatted`-`{python} givewell_cost_per_life_max_formatted` to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society `{python} cost_per_life_investor_funded_formatted` per life saved**.

### Better Than History's Best Public Health Wins

| Intervention | How it Creates Value | Scale of Annual Net Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Childhood Vaccinations** | Prevents immense long-term treatment costs for diseases like measles and polio | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Smoking Cessation** | Prevents expensive chronic diseases (cancer, heart disease) through low-cost interventions | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Water Fluoridation** | Avoids dental care costs for entire populations at negligible cost | Hundreds of Millions to Billions |
| **1% Treaty (Peace Dividend)** | Reduces global conflict costs by 1%, creating massive economic benefit | **~113.6B, Annually** |
| **dFDA (R&D Efficiency)** | Makes clinical research ~82}x more efficient, unlocking huge R&D savings | **~$50.0B, Annually** |

#### Why This Is Different

Vaccines and smoking cessation programs are amazing, they solve specific problems with a high return.

The 1% Treaty and dFDA initiative tackles two problems at once:

1. **The Peace Dividend** is a massive economic gain on par with the largest public health wins, created simply by reducing a global negative (conflict)
2. **The dFDA** then uses a tiny fraction of that gain to fix the *system* of medical research, generating a *second* massive win

Instead of solving one problem, this uses a global-scale win to fund a system-scale win. When you redirect the world's largest source of waste to fund its most impactful opportunity, the math gets wild.

### 10X Bigger Than Childhood Vaccinations

{{< include ../figures/health-programs-vs-1-percent-treaty-societal-benefits-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The $163.6B annual economic benefit (conservative case) makes this intervention nearly **10 larger than childhood vaccinations** (one of the most successful public health programs in history).

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors 271.8% annual returns.

## The Opportunity Cost Clock

Every second we don't implement this system:

- **`{python} endgame_benefit_per_second_formatted`** in value destroyed
- **0.0 quality life-days** lost
- **1.736 preventable deaths** occur

By the time you finish reading this sentence, we've lost roughly $2M.

Every day we delay:

- **$44.8B** in potential value evaporates
- **150,000** people die who could have been saved
- **150,000** suffer from curable diseases
- **Your personal risk** of preventable death increases

Every year we wait is $16.4T lit on fire.
Every day is $44.8B wasted.
Every hour is $1.9B gone.

The $16.4T isn't a dream. It's the mathematical consequence of redirecting humanity's resources from destruction to construction, from killing to curing, from war to wellness.

## What You Actually Get

### Economic Benefits

- Healthcare costs: $0 (covered by trial participation)
- Insurance premiums: $0 (insurance companies become obsolete)
- Bankruptcy from medical bills: Extinct

### Health Benefits

- Your cancer: Prevented or cured
- Your aging: Reversed (choose your biological age)
- Your rare disease: Finally profitable to cure
- Your mental illness: Actually fixed, not just numbed
- Your lifespan: +50-100 healthy years

### Power Benefits

- Direct vote on health spending (real democracy)
- Your proposals compete equally (no gatekeepers)
- Co-creator of humanity's health priorities

## Why This Wins (Game Theory)

### Everyone Profits More From Cures Than Disease

**Defense Contractors**: 271.8% returns > 8% margins. They keep 99% of military budget AND get rich.

**Politicians**: You have $1.0B in campaign funds. They like being elected.

**Big Pharma**: Patients PAY THEM for trials instead of pharma paying. From expense to revenue.

**Insurance**: Every cure = billions saved. They're literally betting on you not dying.

**Billionaires**: 271.8% returns make their current wealth look like pocket change.

**You**: Don't die from preventable disease.

## How to Fund It: VICTORY Bonds

### For Investors: 271.8% Annual Returns Forever

{{< include ../figures/victory-bonds-roi-projection-bar-chart.qmd >}}

#### The Simple Math

- You invest: $1,000
- Annual return: $2,700 (271.8% forever)

---

Humanity can keep spending $118.8T on war and disease, or it can make between $163.6B and $16.4T per year ending both.

The ROI ranges from infinite (when funded by military redirection) to 463:1 (conservative case) to 25,781:1 (endgame projection), depending on what you count.

The math isn't aspirational. It's arithmetic.
