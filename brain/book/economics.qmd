## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the economic impact of redirecting 1% of global military spending ([$27.2B annually](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)) to fund the Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) and Decentralized FDA (dFDA) system. Using net present value analysis and conservative assumptions derived from peer-reviewed research, we demonstrate return on investment ranging from 463:1 to 1,239:1, depending on the scope of benefits included.

The intervention is self-funding, requiring zero net new spending, as funds are redirected from existing military budgets. The economic benefits arise from two independent mechanisms: (1) a peace dividend of [$113.6B annually](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) from reduced conflict costs, and (2) [$50.0B+ in annual healthcare R&D efficiency gains](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) from decentralized clinical trials proven [82x more cost-effective](appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) than traditional approaches.

### Key Findings

- **Conservative ROI**: [463:1](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) (dFDA R&D savings only, 10-year NPV)
- **Complete ROI**: 1,239:1 (all eight primary benefit categories, 10-year average)
- **Cost per life saved**: Net societal benefit of [$6.56M per life](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) (compared to [$3,500-5,500 cost for top GiveWell charities](references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved))
- **Annual lives saved**: [26,446](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) (conservative estimate)

## Introduction

### Methodology

This analysis employs standard health economics frameworks including:

- **Net Present Value (NPV)** analysis with 5% discount rate
- **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** for health outcomes
- **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratios (ICER)** for comparative analysis
- **Sensitivity analysis** examining parameter variations (see [1% Treaty Cost-Effectiveness](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd))

All calculations use conservative assumptions and are validated against peer-reviewed literature, particularly the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) demonstrating 82x cost reduction in pragmatic clinical trials.

### Two-Tier ROI Framework

The 1% Treaty generates measurable returns across two analytical frameworks:

**463:1 = Conservative (dFDA R&D Savings Only)**

- Only counts the $50.0B in annual R&D cost reductions from 82x cheaper trials
- Ignores peace dividend, earlier access, and all secondary benefits
- NPV-based, 10-year timeframe
- This is the floor

**1,239:1 = Complete (All Direct Benefits)**

- Counts all 8 primary benefit categories totaling $1.2T/year
- Includes peace dividend, R&D savings, earlier access, research acceleration, rare diseases, drug prices, prevention, and mental health
- 10-year average
- This is the realistic case

### Analytical Framework Selection

Each ROI tier serves a distinct analytical purpose:

- **Conservative (463:1)**: Minimum expected return based solely on R&D efficiency gains; suitable for risk-averse stakeholders and regulatory approval processes
- **Complete (1,239:1)**: Comprehensive assessment including all eight quantifiable benefit categories; recommended for policy evaluation and foundation grant proposals

Both calculations employ the same rigorous methodology and differ only in scope. The conservative estimate provides the floor for expected returns, while the complete projection captures the full quantifiable societal impact.

## The Conservative Case: 463:1 ROI (dFDA Only)

This conservative analysis examines the minimum expected return by counting only the direct R&D cost savings from implementing the Decentralized FDA system. This approach deliberately excludes the peace dividend, earlier treatment access, and all secondary benefits, providing a defensible floor for economic impact.

### Quantitative Analysis

#### ROI Calculation Methodology

The return on investment (ROI) is calculated using net present value (NPV) analysis with a 5% discount rate over 10 years:

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{NPV of Benefits}}{\text{NPV of Costs}} = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{B_t}{(1+r)^t}}{\sum_{t=0}^{10} \frac{C_t}{(1+r)^t}}
$$

where:

- $B_t$ = Annual benefits in year $t$
- $C_t$ = Annual costs in year $t$
- $r$ = 5% discount rate
- $t$ = Year (0 = initial investment, 1-10 = operational years)

For the conservative case (463:1), we calculate:

$$
\text{ROI}_{\text{conservative}} = \frac{\$249.3\text{B}}{\$538\text{M}} = 463:1
$$

where [$249.3B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) is the NPV of benefits and [$538M](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) is the NPV of costs. All detailed calculations are in the [Economic Models Notebook](./economics/economic_models.ipynb).

#### The Funding Source (Peace Dividend)

- **Captured Dividend**: 1% of global military spending = **[$27.2B annually](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** to fund the initiative
- **Societal Dividend**: Same 1% reduction generates **[$113.6B in annual economic value](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** through decreased conflict costs

**Peace Dividend Calculation Breakdown**:

The $113.6B annual peace dividend derives from 1% reduction in total global war costs of [$11.355T annually](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd):

$$
\$11{,}355\text{B} \times 1\% = \$113.6\text{B}
$$

| Cost Category | Annual Amount | Components |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **Direct Military Spending** | [$2,718B](references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending) | SIPRI 2024 global military budgets |
| **[Infrastructure Destruction](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | [$1,875B](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) | Transportation, energy, communications, water, education, healthcare facilities |
| **Human Life Losses** | $2,446B | [244,600 conflict deaths](references.qmd#acled-active-combat-deaths) × [$10M value of statistical life](references.qmd#dot-vsl-13-6m) (conservative vs. DOT $13.7M) |
| **[Trade Disruption](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | [$616B](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) | Shipping, supply chains, energy prices, currency volatility |
| **[Lost Economic Growth](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | [$2,718B](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) | Opportunity cost of military spending vs. productive investment |
| **[Veteran Healthcare](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | [$200B](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) | Long-term medical care for conflict-related injuries |
| **Refugee Support** | $150B | [108.4M displaced persons](references.qmd#unhcr-forcibly-displaced-2023) × $1,384/year |
| **[Environmental Damage](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | [$100B](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) | Ecosystem destruction, toxic contamination, restoration costs |
| **[Psychological Impact](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | [$232B](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) | PTSD treatment, mental health services, productivity loss |
| **[Lost Human Capital](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | [$300B](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) | Productive capacity lost from casualties and displacement |
| **Total War Costs** | **$11,355B** | Combined direct and indirect annual costs |
| **1% Reduction** | **$113.6B** | Peace dividend from 1% treaty implementation |

This calculation methodology follows standard cost-of-conflict analysis frameworks used by the World Bank, IMF, and academic conflict economics research. See [Peace Dividend Calculations](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) for detailed sources and methodology.

#### The Investment (dFDA Infrastructure)

- **Total Cost (NPV)**: 10-year discounted cost to build and operate = **[$538M](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)**
- **Funding Sustainability**: Annual captured dividend ([$27.2B](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)) covers annual operational cost ([$40M](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)) **680 times over**

**NPV Cost Breakdown** (10-year discounted at 5%, conservative estimate):

| Cost Component | Amount | Details |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **Upfront Costs** | | |
| [Core dFDA Platform Build](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) | [$40M](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) | Platform development, testing, regulatory approval |
| [DIH Initiatives Setup](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) | [$230M](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) | Wishocracy system, governance infrastructure, legal framework |
| **Total Upfront** | **[$270M](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)** | One-time implementation costs (Year 0) |
| **Annual Operating Costs** | | |
| [dFDA Platform Operations](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) | [$19M/year](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) | Maintenance, infrastructure, regulatory coordination (mid-range estimate) |
| [DIH Annual Operations](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) | [$21M/year](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) | Governance, community support, treasury management |
| **Total Annual Opex** | **[$40M/year](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)** | Ongoing operational costs |
| **NPV Calculations** | | |
| Present Value of Opex | [$268M](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) | 10-year opex discounted at 5%, assumes 5-year linear adoption ramp |
| **Total NPV Cost** | **[$538M](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)** | Upfront ($270M) + PV of opex ($268M) |

This conservative estimate assumes gradual adoption (0% to 100% over 5 years) and mid-range operational costs. For detailed NPV methodology including sensitivity to discount rates and adoption curves, see [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd).

#### The Return (Health & Wealth)

- **Economic Return (NPV)**: 10-year discounted net benefit = **[$249.3B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)** in R&D savings alone
- **Robust ROI**: [$249.3B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) / [$538M](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) = **[463:1](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)**
- **Health Return**: **[840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)** annually

**Summary**: The 1% Treaty generates economic value through two independent mechanisms:

1. **Peace Dividend**: 1% reduction in global military spending generates **[$113.6B](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** in annual economic value through decreased conflict costs (infrastructure preservation, reduced humanitarian costs, enhanced economic activity in formerly conflict-affected regions)
2. **dFDA R&D Efficiency**: A fraction of captured peace dividend ([$538M](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) over 10 years) funds dFDA infrastructure, unlocking **[$50.0B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)** in annual R&D cost savings plus [840,000 QALYs](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) through improved trial efficiency

**Total Annual Benefit**: [$163.6B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) per year (conservative estimate)

**[Sensitivity Analysis](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)**: Even under worst-case parameter assumptions (50% lower benefits, 100% higher costs), the system maintains ROI between [189:1 and 1,281:1](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd). See [1% Treaty Cost-Effectiveness](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) for complete sensitivity analysis.

### Cost-Effectiveness: Dominant Health Intervention

Unlike traditional public health interventions that require ongoing funding, the 1% Treaty represents a **dominant intervention**, simultaneously reducing costs while improving health outcomes. This places it in a unique category alongside smallpox eradication and other transformative health achievements.

#### Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)

The ICER measures cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained:

$$
\text{ICER} = \frac{\Delta \text{Cost}}{\Delta \text{QALYs}} = \frac{C_{\text{intervention}} - C_{\text{baseline}}}{Q_{\text{intervention}} - Q_{\text{baseline}}}
$$

For the 1% Treaty/dFDA system:

$$
\text{ICER} = \frac{-\$249.3\text{B}}{840,000 \text{ QALYs}} = -\$296,786 \text{ per QALY}
$$

where [-$249.3B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) represents net cost savings and [840,000 QALYs](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) represents annual quality-adjusted life years gained. The negative ICER indicates **cost savings while improving health**, a dominant intervention by health economics standards. Standard [willingness-to-pay thresholds are $50,000-150,000 per QALY](references.qmd#icer-qaly-methodology); interventions that save costs while gaining QALYs are unconditionally recommended. For comprehensive ICER analysis including alternative funding perspectives, see [dFDA ICER Analysis](appendix/dfda-icer-analysis.qmd).

#### Comparative Cost per Life Saved

- **[Against Malaria Foundation](references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)**: $3,500 cost per life saved (GiveWell top charity)
- **[Deworm the World Initiative](references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)**: $5,500 cost per life saved (highly cost-effective intervention)
- **1% Treaty/dFDA System**: [$6,560,000 net societal benefit](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) per life saved (dominant intervention)

The negative cost (net benefit) per life saved distinguishes this as a dominant intervention in health economics terminology, an intervention that both reduces costs and improves outcomes, with no trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness.

### This ROI in Historical Context

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves **463:1 return on investment**.

This exceptional ROI comes from:

- **$50.0B in annual R&D cost savings**: [82x reduction](appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) in clinical trial costs
- **Faster access to new treatments**: [2 years instead of 17 years](appendix/dfda-assumptions.qmd) to market
- **Better prevention through real-world data**: Continuous learning from millions of patients
- **Enabling new therapies**: Making [rare disease trials](references.qmd#rare-disease-patients-300m-globally) economically viable

{{< include ../figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

Comparison to historical public health achievements (ROI ratios):

| Intervention | ROI | Source |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **1% Treaty/dFDA** | **463:1** | This analysis |
| [Smallpox eradication](references.qmd#smallpox-eradication-roi) | 159-400:1 | WHO intensive campaign (1967-1980) |
| [Clean water & sanitation](references.qmd#clean-water-sanitation-roi) | 4-21:1 | WHO/WaterAid (LMICs) |
| [Childhood vaccinations](references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi) | 10-16:1 | CDC immunization economic analyses |
| Average pharma drug | 2:1 | Industry standard (Tufts CSDD) |

The 1% Treaty/dFDA system **rivals or exceeds the ROI of smallpox eradication**, previously considered the gold standard of public health interventions. For detailed comparisons across all major health interventions, see [Intervention Comparison Table](appendix/intervention-comparison-table.qmd).

### Self-Funding Mechanism Through Military Budget Redirection

{{< include ../figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

The 1% Treaty financing structure creates a self-funding system requiring zero net new spending from donors or taxpayers.

**Economic Structure** ([see detailed calculation](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)):

- **Funding Source**: [$27.2B annually](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) from 1% redirection of existing military budgets (money already allocated in national budgets)
- **Annual Benefits**: [$163.6B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) (Peace dividend: [$113.6B](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) + R&D savings: [$50.0B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd))
- **Operating Costs**: [$290M annually](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) (campaign operations and dFDA infrastructure)
- **Net Position**: [$163.3B annual surplus](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) after all costs
- **Lives Saved**: [26,446 annually](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)

$$
925{,}610 \text{ QALYs} \div 35 \text{ QALYs/life} = 26{,}446 \text{ lives}
$$

- **Cost per Life Saved**: Net societal benefit of `{python} cost_per_life_investor_funded_formatted` per life ([negative cost](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) indicates net profit)

This financing structure classifies the 1% Treaty as a **dominant health intervention** using standard health economics terminology, an intervention with both lower costs and better health outcomes than the status quo, requiring no trade-off between cost-effectiveness and impact.

The self-funding nature eliminates traditional barriers to scale, as the intervention generates sufficient economic surplus to sustain and expand operations without ongoing charitable contributions.

## The Complete Case: 1,239:1 ROI (All Direct Benefits)

The conservative 463:1 calculation deliberately excludes most system benefits to establish a defensible floor. A comprehensive analysis including all eight quantifiable primary benefit categories demonstrates substantially higher returns.

### $1.2T in Annual Benefits

The complete benefit framework encompasses eight measurable categories. Total annual benefit $B_{\text{total}}$ is calculated as:

$$
B_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^{8} B_i = B_{\text{peace}} + B_{\text{R\&D}} + B_{\text{access}} + B_{\text{research}} + B_{\text{rare}} + B_{\text{prices}} + B_{\text{prevention}} + B_{\text{mental}}
$$

where each benefit category is:

1. **Peace dividend** ([$113.6B](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)) - Societal savings from 1% less conflict
2. **R&D cost savings** ([$50.0B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)) - 82x cheaper trials
3. **7-year access acceleration** ([$300.0B](appendix/economic-value-of-accelerated-treatments.qmd)) - Earlier treatment access during trials
4. **Research acceleration** ([$100.0B](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)) - 115X more research capacity (10-20X more breakthroughs)
5. **Rare disease treatments** ($400.0B) - Economically viable orphan drug development for [300M patients](references.qmd#rare-disease-patients-300m-globally) with diseases lacking treatments ([95% of 7,000+ rare diseases](references.qmd#95-pct-diseases-no-treatment) have no FDA-approved therapy)
6. **Drug price reductions** ($100.0B) - Conservative estimate based on [U.S. drug prices 2.78x higher](references.qmd#us-drug-prices-vs-peer-countries) than peer countries ($360B annual U.S. spending; 20-50% reduction potential = $72-180B from U.S. alone)
7. **Prevention medicine** ($100.0B) - Based on [global clinical trial market](appendix/global-clinical-trial-spending-by-phase.qmd) projections exceeding $100B annually, enabling economically viable prevention studies
8. **Mental health** ($75.0B) - Conservative partial closure of [$200B funding gap](references.qmd#mental-health-nonprofit-grants) identified for global mental health care needs

$$
B_{\text{total}} = 113.6 + 50.0 + 300.0 + 100.0 + 400.0 + 100.0 + 100.0 + 75.0 = \$1,238.6\text{B} \approx \$1.2\text{T}
$$

#### Complete Case ROI

$$
\text{ROI}_{\text{complete}} = \frac{\$1,238.6\text{B annual} \times 10\text{ years}}{\$1.0\text{B implementation}} = 1,239:1
$$

where [$1,238.6B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) is the total annual benefit across all eight categories, 10 years is the NPV-adjusted time horizon, and [$1.0B](economics/campaign-budget.qmd) is the total implementation cost. The two largest contributors—**earlier access acceleration** and **research capacity expansion**—are often misunderstood as the same thing. They're not:

- **Earlier Access** = Patients access the SAME treatments 7 years sooner (during trials instead of post-approval)
- **Research Acceleration** = System runs 115X MORE trials, finding 10-20X MORE breakthroughs

Both are conservative estimates based on proven models ([RECOVERY trial](appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) costs, disease prevalence data, standard QALY valuations).

### Research Acceleration Mechanism: How We Get 115X

The 115x research acceleration multiplier is derived from specific, measurable improvements across four dimensions:

**Current System Baseline**:

- [3,300 clinical trials initiated per year](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)
- [60% completion rate](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) = **[1,980 completed trials/year](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)**
- [10,000 active trials](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) at any time (3-5 year duration)
- [0.2% patient eligibility](appendix/clinical-trial-participants.qmd) (5M trial slots for [2.4B people with chronic disease](references.qmd#disease-prevalence-2-billion))
- [40% abandonment rate](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) (studies never complete)
- [6-18 months to recruit 100 patients](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)

**dFDA System Performance**:

- [380,000 trials/year capacity](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)
- [95% completion rate](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) = **[361,000 completed trials/year](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)**
- [200,000 active trials](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) at any time (3-12 month duration)
- [50% patient eligibility](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) ([1.2B eligible](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) with minimal exclusions)
- [5% abandonment rate](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) (economic incentives flipped)
- [3 weeks to recruit 1,000 patients](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)

**Multiplier Derivation**:

| Factor | Current | dFDA | Multiplier |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| **[Recruitment Speed](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** | 6-18 months for 100 patients | 3 weeks for 1,000 patients | **[25x](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |
| **[Trial Completion Speed](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** | 3-5 years (perverse incentives) | 3-12 months (aligned incentives) | **[10x](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |
| **[Simultaneous Trials](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** | 10,000 active trials | 200,000 active trials | **[20x](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |
| **[Completion Rate](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** | 60% finish | 95% finish | **[1.6x](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |
| **Funding Increase** | [$67.5B medical research](appendix/global-government-medical-research-spending.qmd) | [$94.7B](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) ($67.5B + $27.2B) | **[1.4x](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |

**Theoretical Maximum**:

$$
25 \times 10 \times 1.6 \times 1.4 = 560
$$

This represents **[560x](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** more completed trials per year

**Conservative Estimate**: [180x](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) accounting for real-world friction (ramp-up, adoption, learning curves)

**Used in Analysis**: **[115x](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** (further conservative adjustment for foundation grant proposal credibility)

This represents:

- From [1,980 completed trials/year](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) → [227,700 completed trials/year](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) (115x)
- From [50 drug approvals/year](references.qmd#global-new-drug-approvals-50-annually) → [1,000-2,000 approvals/year](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) (20-40x)
- From [$41,000 cost per patient](appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) → [$500-1,000 cost per patient](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) ([82x cost reduction](appendix/recovery-trial.qmd), proven by Oxford RECOVERY trial)

## Personal Economic Impact: From Societal to Individual

The aggregate societal benefits ($163.6B-$1.2T annually) result from individual economic gains multiplied across billions of people. Understanding individual impact helps explain both the scale and the equity of the Disease Eradication Model.

## Problem Statement and Opportunity Cost

### Current Resource Allocation

Global spending on health-related challenges demonstrates significant misalignment between resource allocation and burden of disease (see [Humanity's Budget](appendix/humanity-budget-overview.qmd) for complete breakdown):

- **Military spending**: [$2.7 trillion annually](references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending) ([40X](appendix/humanity-budget-overview.qmd) [medical research funding](appendix/global-government-medical-research-spending.qmd))
- **Symptomatic disease treatment**: [$8.2 trillion annually](references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t) (primarily managing chronic conditions rather than curative interventions)
- **Economic burden of disease**: [$109 trillion annually](references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t) in lost productivity, premature mortality, and disability-adjusted life years
- **Total annual cost**: [$119.8 trillion](appendix/humanity-budget-overview.qmd)

**Current investment in curative research**:

- Global government medical research: [$68 billion annually](appendix/global-government-medical-research-spending.qmd)

$$
\frac{\$68\text{B}}{\$119.8\text{T}} = 0.057\% \text{ of total disease burden}
$$

- Disease eradication achievements: Zero in past 50 years (since [smallpox, 1980](references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated))
- Resource allocation ratio: 1:40 (medical research : military spending)

### Mortality and Morbidity Burden

<!-- ![Annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](../../assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png) -->

The World Health Organization reports [150,000 daily deaths](references.qmd#who-daily-deaths) from preventable or potentially curable diseases ([54.75 million annually](references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)). This mortality burden exceeds:

- [Annual terrorism deaths](references.qmd#chance-of-dying-from-terrorism-1-in-30m) by a factor of [18,274:1](references.qmd#chance-of-dying-from-terrorism-1-in-30m)

$$
\frac{54.75\text{M disease deaths}}{3{,}000\text{ terrorism deaths}} \approx 18{,}274:1
$$

- [Annual war deaths](references.qmd#acled-active-combat-deaths) by a factor of 137:1 (based on [244,600 conflict deaths](references.qmd#acled-active-combat-deaths) annually)

$$
\frac{54.75\text{M disease deaths}}{400{,}000\text{ conflict deaths}} \approx 137:1
$$

Despite this disparity in mortality burden, resource allocation heavily favors security spending over medical research and curative interventions.

## How This Compares to History

### Better Than the Best Charities

Here's how it compares to the most effective charities in the world ([GiveWell top charities](references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)):

| Intervention | Cost to Achieve Outcome | This Initiative's Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[GiveWell Top Charities](references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)** (e.g., Against Malaria Foundation) | Spend **~`{python} givewell_cost_per_life_min_formatted` - `{python} givewell_cost_per_life_max_formatted`** to save one life | Generate **[840,000 QALYs](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)** annually while creating **[$249.3B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)** in net economic value |

**The Difference**: GiveWell's charities are the best ways to spend money to save lives. They cost money but save lives very efficiently.

This plan doesn't cost money, it *makes* money while saving lives. Instead of asking people to donate, it makes everyone richer while curing diseases.

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend `{python} givewell_cost_per_life_min_formatted`-`{python} givewell_cost_per_life_max_formatted` to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society `{python} cost_per_life_investor_funded_formatted` per life saved**.

### Better Than History's Best Public Health Wins

| Intervention | How it Creates Value | Scale of Annual Net Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Childhood Vaccinations](references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi)** | Prevents immense long-term treatment costs for diseases like measles and polio | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Smoking Cessation** | Prevents expensive chronic diseases (cancer, heart disease) through low-cost interventions | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **[Water & Sanitation](references.qmd#clean-water-sanitation-roi)** | Avoids disease costs for entire populations at low cost | Hundreds of Millions to Billions |
| **[1% Treaty (Peace Dividend)](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | Reduces global conflict costs by 1%, creating massive economic benefit | **~113.6B, Annually** |
| **[dFDA (R&D Efficiency)](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)** | Makes clinical research ~82x more efficient, unlocking huge R&D savings | **~$50.0B, Annually** |

#### Why This Is Different

Vaccines and smoking cessation programs are amazing, they solve specific problems with a high return.

The 1% Treaty and dFDA initiative tackles two problems at once:

1. **The Peace Dividend** is a massive economic gain on par with the largest public health wins, created simply by reducing a global negative (conflict)
2. **The dFDA** then uses a tiny fraction of that gain to fix the *system* of medical research, generating a *second* massive win

Instead of solving one problem, this uses a global-scale win to fund a system-scale win. When you redirect the world's largest source of waste to fund its most impactful opportunity, the math gets wild.

### 10X Larger Than Childhood Vaccinations

{{< include ../figures/health-programs-vs-1-percent-treaty-societal-benefits-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The conservative case annual economic benefit of [$163.6B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) significantly exceeds the most successful public health programs in history. Comparing to [childhood vaccination programs](references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi) (estimated [$10-20B annual global benefit](references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi) from preventing measles, polio, etc.):

$$
\text{Relative Scale} = \frac{\$163.6\text{B}}{\sim\$15\text{B}} \approx 11:1
$$

where $163.6B is the [1% Treaty conservative case benefit](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) and $15B is the estimated [childhood vaccination annual benefit](references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi).

This makes the 1% Treaty/dFDA system **[11X larger in economic impact](appendix/intervention-comparison-table.qmd)** than childhood vaccinations, one of the most successful public health interventions ever implemented.

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates [$163.6B](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) in annual economic surplus (conservative case) to sustain operations and expansion without requiring ongoing charitable contributions.

## The Opportunity Cost Clock

Every second we don't implement this system:

- **$38,051** in foregone economic value

$$
\frac{\$1.2\text{T}}{365 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours} \times 3600 \text{ seconds}} = \$38{,}051/\text{second}
$$

- **1.736 preventable deaths** occur

$$
\frac{54.75\text{M deaths/year}}{365 \times 24 \times 3600 \text{ seconds}} = 1.736 \text{ deaths/second}
$$

**Daily Opportunity Cost**:

- **$3.3B** in foregone economic value

$$
\$1.2\text{T} \div 365 \text{ days} = \$3.3\text{B/day}
$$

- **150,000** preventable deaths
- **150,000** individuals experiencing curable disease burden
- **1.736 deaths per second** from addressable conditions

**Annual Opportunity Cost**:

- **$1.2T** in foregone economic value (complete case benefit)
- **54.75 million** preventable deaths
- **$109T** in disease burden continues

These figures represent the mathematical consequence of maintaining current resource allocation patterns versus implementing the 1% Treaty system.

## Stakeholder Analysis and Incentive Alignment

The 1% Treaty creates positive economic incentives across all major stakeholder groups, eliminating traditional opposition to healthcare system reform. This alignment of economic incentives is critical for political feasibility and sustainable implementation.

**Key Stakeholder Benefits** (see [Aligning Incentives](solution/aligning-incentives.qmd) for detailed analysis):

- **Defense sector**: Retains [99% of current budget](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) while gaining access to medical R&D contracts from 1% redirection
- **Pharmaceutical industry**: Trial costs shift from expense to revenue (patients fund participation); [research capacity increases 115X](appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)
- **Insurance providers**: Net savings from [reduced disease burden](references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t) ([$109T current economic cost](references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t))
- **Healthcare providers**: Increased treatment options; [earlier access to effective therapies](appendix/economic-value-of-accelerated-treatments.qmd)
- **Patients**: Access to clinical trials as healthcare delivery mechanism; democratized research priority-setting through [wishocratic governance](solution/wishocracy.qmd)
- **Taxpayers**: Net reduction in healthcare costs through improved R&D efficiency

See [Aligning Incentives](solution/aligning-incentives.qmd) for detailed stakeholder analysis and implementation strategy.

## Implementation Strategy

The economic benefits outlined above demonstrate the value proposition of the 1% Treaty system. Implementation requires political mobilization to achieve treaty adoption:

**For comprehensive implementation details**, see:

- **[Campaign Budget](economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** - Detailed breakdown of political mobilization costs
- **[VICTORY Bonds](economics/victory-bonds.qmd)** - Financing mechanism for lobbying efforts
- **[Financial Plan Overview](economics/financial-plan.qmd)** - Complete fundraising, spending, and treasury management framework

### Campaign Budget Breakdown

The [$1.0B campaign cost](economics/campaign-budget.qmd) (used as denominator in complete case 1,239:1 ROI) allocates funds across seven strategic categories:

| Budget Category | Amount | Purpose |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **[Viral Referendum](economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** | [$200M](economics/campaign-budget.qmd) | Global direct democracy campaign, social media amplification, petition platforms |
| **[AI-Assisted Lobbying](economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** | [$250M](economics/campaign-budget.qmd) | Automated legislative outreach, personalized constituent messaging, political mapping |
| **[Technology Platform](economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** | [$250M](economics/campaign-budget.qmd) | Voting infrastructure, transparency systems, wishocracy implementation |
| **[Legal & Compliance](economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** | [$100M](economics/campaign-budget.qmd) | International treaty law, regulatory compliance, jurisdictional coordination |
| **[Partnerships](economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** | [$100M](economics/campaign-budget.qmd) | Coalition building with NGOs, medical organizations, patient advocacy groups |
| **[Operations](economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** | [$50M](economics/campaign-budget.qmd) | Campaign management, communications, logistics, staffing |
| **[Reserve](economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** | [$50M](economics/campaign-budget.qmd) | Contingency for unforeseen challenges and opportunities |
| **Total Campaign Cost** | **[$1,000M](economics/campaign-budget.qmd)** | 4-year implementation timeline (amortized: $250M/year) |

This budget is designed for a 3-5 year campaign to achieve treaty ratification by major powers, representing less than 4% of the first year's conservative benefits ($163.6B). The campaign cost is a one-time investment with perpetual returns, as the system becomes self-sustaining through the captured peace dividend.

This economic analysis focuses on the return on investment once the system is operational, demonstrating that the intervention generates 463:1 to 1,239:1 returns regardless of the specific path to adoption.

## Risk Analysis and Mitigation

### Implementation Risks

**Political Risk**: Treaty adoption requires coordination across multiple national governments

- *Mitigation*: Dual-track approach combining grassroots referendum with diplomatic engagement (see [Treaty Adoption Strategy](strategy/treaty-adoption-strategy.qmd))
- *Precedent*: Historical military spending reductions have occurred during periods of public mobilization (post-WW2, post-Cold War)

**Technical Risk**: dFDA platform development and scaling challenges

- *Mitigation*: Phased rollout beginning with proven platforms (similar to RECOVERY trial model); open-source architecture enabling distributed development
- *Validation*: Oxford [RECOVERY trial](appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) demonstrated 82x cost reduction at scale (11,000+ participants, 6 treatment arms, $5M total cost)

**Adoption Risk**: Insufficient patient enrollment in decentralized trials

- *Mitigation*: Economic incentives (free treatment + compensation); improved trial accessibility; democratized research priorities
- *Evidence*: Current clinical trial participation ([0.06% of population](appendix/clinical-trial-participants.qmd)) limited by access barriers, not willingness

**Financial Risk**: Insufficient funding to achieve referendum threshold and political mobilization

- *Mitigation*: Multi-stage fundraising with milestone-based releases; diversified funding sources; assurance contracts
- *Conservative threshold*: [280M votes](references.qmd#3-5-rule) ([3.5% of global population](references.qmd#3-5-rule)) through viral referendum mechanics

See [Investor Risk Analysis](appendix/investor-risk-analysis.qmd) for complete risk assessment and sensitivity analysis.

### Governance and Accountability

**DIH Treasury Governance**: [Wishocratic system](solution/wishocracy.qmd) enabling democratic allocation of research funding

- [8 billion potential participants](solution/wishocracy.qmd) (any human) vs. current centralized decision-making ([200 NIH staff](references.qmd#nih-decision-makers-200-people))
- Quadratic voting mechanism prevents plutocratic capture
- Transparent, auditable allocation via blockchain-based system

**dFDA Platform Governance**: Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure

- Open-source protocols ensuring transparency and reproducibility
- Distributed validation preventing single-point failures
- Regulatory compliance framework integrating with national authorities

**Financial Accountability**: Independent oversight and reporting

- Annual third-party audits of DIH treasury and dFDA operations
- Public reporting of all expenditures and outcomes
- Milestone-based funding releases tied to measurable objectives

See [Governance Framework](appendix/governance.qmd) and [Legal Compliance Framework](appendix/legal-compliance-framework.qmd) for complete governance structures.

## Conclusion

This economic analysis demonstrates that redirecting 1% of global military spending to medical research through the Decentralized Institutes of Health and Decentralized FDA system generates return on investment ranging from 463:1 (conservative estimate) to 1,239:1 (complete estimate), depending on analytical scope.

**Key Findings**:

- **Self-funding structure**: Zero net new spending required (funds redirected from existing military budgets)
- **Dominant intervention**: Simultaneously reduces costs and improves health outcomes
- **Conservative ROI**: [463:1](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) based solely on R&D efficiency gains

$$
\frac{\$249.3\text{B NPV benefit}}{\$538\text{M NPV cost}} = 463:1
$$

(see [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd))

- **Complete ROI**: 1,239:1 including all eight quantifiable benefit categories ([$1.2T annual benefit](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd))
- **Lives saved**: [26,446 annually](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) at net societal benefit of [$6.56M per life](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)
- **Political feasibility**: Positive economic incentives across all major stakeholder groups

**Comparative Context**: This intervention rivals or exceeds the cost-effectiveness of history's most successful public health achievements (see [Intervention Comparison Table](appendix/intervention-comparison-table.qmd) for detailed ROI comparisons including smallpox eradication and childhood vaccinations) while requiring no ongoing charitable funding.

**Implementation Pathway**: Phased approach beginning with global referendum and political mobilization, proceeding through treaty adoption, DIH establishment, and dFDA deployment over [36 months](strategy/roadmap.qmd) (see [Roadmap](strategy/roadmap.qmd) for complete implementation timeline).

The economic case is grounded in conservative assumptions, validated against peer-reviewed evidence (particularly the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](appendix/recovery-trial.qmd)), and subjected to comprehensive [sensitivity analysis](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd). The methodology employs standard health economics frameworks (NPV, QALYs, ICER) to enable comparison with existing interventions and facilitate foundation grant evaluation processes.
