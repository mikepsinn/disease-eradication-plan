## TL;DR: Three Ways to Calculate the Return

Depending on what you count, the 1% Treaty generates between `{python} format_roi(ROI_DFDA_SAVINGS_ONLY)` and `{python} format_roi(ROI_WITH_MULTIPLIER_EFFECTS)` ROI:

**`{python} format_roi(ROI_DFDA_SAVINGS_ONLY)` = Conservative (dFDA R&D Savings Only)**

- Only counts the `{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS_ANNUAL)` in annual R&D cost reductions from `{python} TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_FACTOR`x cheaper trials
- Ignores peace dividend, earlier access, and all secondary benefits
- NPV-based, 10-year timeframe
- This is the floor

**`{python} format_roi(ROI_ALL_DIRECT_BENEFITS)` = Complete (All Direct Benefits)**

- Counts all 8 primary benefit categories totaling `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_COMPLETE_BENEFITS_ANNUAL)`/year
- Includes peace dividend, R&D savings, earlier access, research acceleration, rare diseases, drug prices, prevention, and mental health
- 10-year average
- This is the realistic case

**`{python} format_roi(ROI_WITH_MULTIPLIER_EFFECTS)` = Endgame (Year 20 Compounding)**

- Adds all secondary multiplier effects: productivity gains, global trade, infrastructure preservation, avoided crises, innovation acceleration
- Reaches `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ENDGAME_BENEFITS_ANNUAL)` annual value at maturity
- This is where we're actually headed

**Which one should you cite?**

- Conservative audience: Use `{python} format_roi(ROI_DFDA_SAVINGS_ONLY)`
- Complete pitch: Use `{python} format_roi(ROI_ALL_DIRECT_BENEFITS)`
- True believers: Use `{python} format_roi(ROI_WITH_MULTIPLIER_EFFECTS)`

All three are correct. They just count different things.

## The Conservative Case: `{python} format_roi(ROI_DFDA_SAVINGS_ONLY)` ROI (dFDA Only)

If we ONLY count the cheapest, most conservative benefit—making clinical trials `{python} TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_FACTOR`x cheaper—here's what we get:

### The Numbers

All calculations in our [Economic Models Notebook](./economics/economic_models.ipynb).

**The Funding Source (Peace Dividend):**

- **Captured Dividend**: 1% of global military spending = **`{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)` annually** to fund the initiative
- **Societal Dividend**: Same 1% reduction generates **`{python} format_billions(PEACE_DIVIDEND_ANNUAL_SOCIETAL_BENEFIT)` in annual economic value** through decreased conflict costs

**The Investment (dFDA Infrastructure):**

- **Total Cost (NPV)**: 10-year discounted cost to build and operate = **`{python} format_currency(DFDA_NPV_TOTAL_COST)`**
- **Funding Sustainability**: Annual captured dividend (`{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)`) covers annual operational cost (`{python} format_millions(DFDA_ANNUAL_OPEX)`) **`{python} f"{DIVIDEND_COVERAGE_FACTOR:,.0f}"` times over**

**The Return (Health & Wealth):**

- **Economic Return (NPV)**: 10-year discounted net benefit = **`{python} format_billions(DFDA_NPV_NET_BENEFIT_CONSERVATIVE)`** in R&D savings alone
- **Robust ROI**: `{python} format_billions(DFDA_NPV_NET_BENEFIT_CONSERVATIVE)` / `{python} format_currency(DFDA_NPV_TOTAL_COST)` = **`{python} format_roi(ROI_DFDA_SAVINGS_ONLY)`**
- **Health Return**: **`{python} format_qalys(GLOBAL_DFDA_QALYS_GAINED_ANNUAL)` Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** annually

**Bottom Line**: The treaty takes 1% of what humanity spends on bombs and redirects it to cure diseases instead. This creates two massive, independent wins:

1. **The Peace Dividend**: Society gets **`{python} format_billions(PEACE_DIVIDEND_ANNUAL_SOCIETAL_BENEFIT)`** richer every year from slightly less conflict
2. **The dFDA Bonus**: We use a fraction of that dividend to unlock **`{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS_ANNUAL)`** in R&D savings annually, plus `{python} format_qalys(GLOBAL_DFDA_QALYS_GAINED_ANNUAL)` years of healthy life

**Total Annual Benefit: ~`{python} format_billions(TREATY_TOTAL_ANNUAL_BENEFITS)` per year.**

*Even in worst-case scenarios, the system achieves ROI between **`{python} format_roi(CONSERVATIVE_SCENARIO_ROI)` and `{python} format_roi(OPTIMISTIC_SCENARIO_ROI)`**.*

### Why This ROI Beats History

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves **`{python} format_roi(ROI_DFDA_SAVINGS_ONLY)` return on investment**.

This exceptional ROI comes from:

- **`{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS_ANNUAL)` in annual R&D cost savings**: `{python} TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_FACTOR`x reduction in clinical trial costs
- **Faster access to new treatments**: 2 years instead of 17 years to market
- **Better prevention through real-world data**: Continuous learning from millions of patients
- **Enabling new therapies**: Making rare disease trials economically viable

{{< include ../figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

This beats history's greatest public health achievements:

- Smallpox eradication: `{python} format_roi(SMALLPOX_ERADICATION_ROI)`
- Childhood vaccinations: `{python} format_roi(CHILDHOOD_VACCINATION_ROI)`
- Water fluoridation: `{python} format_roi(WATER_FLUORIDATION_ROI)`

### Infinite ROI When Funded by Military Redirection

{{< include ../figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

When funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**.

**Why the ROI is literally infinite** ([see full calculation](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)):

- **Zero net cost**: The `{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)` comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **`{python} format_billions(TREATY_TOTAL_ANNUAL_BENEFITS)` in annual benefits**: Peace dividend (`{python} format_billions(PEACE_DIVIDEND_ANNUAL_SOCIETAL_BENEFIT)`) + R&D savings (`{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS_ANNUAL)`)
- **Operating costs**: Only `{python} format_millions(TREATY_TOTAL_ANNUAL_COSTS)`/year (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: `{python} format_qalys(SENSITIVITY_LIVES_SAVED_CENTRAL)`/year (`{python} format_qalys(TREATY_TOTAL_QALYS_GAINED_ANNUAL)` QALYs ÷ `{python} STANDARD_QALYS_PER_LIFE_SAVED` QALYs/life)
- **The math**: `{python} format_billions(TREATY_TOTAL_ANNUAL_BENEFITS)` benefit ÷ $0 new spending = ∞ (infinite ROI)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS `${python} f"{abs(COST_PER_LIFE_INVESTOR_FUNDED):.2f}"` million instead of spending

This is a **dominant health intervention**: it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives.

Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates `{python} format_billions(TREATY_TOTAL_ANNUAL_BENEFITS)` annually while saving `{python} format_qalys(SENSITIVITY_LIVES_SAVED_CENTRAL)` lives.

## The Complete Case: `{python} format_roi(ROI_ALL_DIRECT_BENEFITS)` ROI (All Direct Benefits)

The conservative `{python} format_roi(ROI_DFDA_SAVINGS_ONLY)` calculation only counts dFDA R&D savings. But the 1% Treaty does much more.

### `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_COMPLETE_BENEFITS_ANNUAL)` in Annual Benefits

When you count all eight primary benefit categories:

1. **Peace dividend** (`{python} format_billions(PEACE_DIVIDEND_ANNUAL_SOCIETAL_BENEFIT)`) - Societal savings from 1% less conflict
2. **R&D cost savings** (`{python} format_billions(BENEFIT_RESEARCH_AND_DEVELOPMENT_SAVINGS_ANNUAL)`) - `{python} TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_FACTOR`x cheaper trials
3. **7-year access acceleration** (`{python} format_billions(BENEFIT_EARLIER_DRUG_ACCESS_ANNUAL)`) - Earlier treatment access during trials
4. **Research acceleration** (`{python} format_billions(BENEFIT_MEDICAL_RESEARCH_ACCELERATION_ANNUAL)`) - 115X more research capacity (10-20X more breakthroughs)
5. **Rare disease treatments** (`{python} format_billions(BENEFIT_RARE_DISEASES_ANNUAL)`) - Economically viable orphan drug development
6. **Drug price reductions** (`{python} format_billions(BENEFIT_DRUG_PRICE_REDUCTION_ANNUAL)`) - R&D savings passed to consumers
7. **Prevention medicine** (`{python} format_billions(BENEFIT_PREVENTION_ANNUAL)`) - Economically viable prevention trials
8. **Mental health** (`{python} format_billions(BENEFIT_MENTAL_HEALTH_ANNUAL)`) - Closing the treatment gap

**Total: `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_COMPLETE_BENEFITS_ANNUAL)`/year in quantifiable benefits = `{python} format_roi(ROI_ALL_DIRECT_BENEFITS)` ROI**

The two largest contributors—**earlier access acceleration** and **research capacity expansion**—are often misunderstood as the same thing. They're not:

- **Earlier Access** = Patients access the SAME treatments 7 years sooner (during trials instead of post-approval)
- **Research Acceleration** = System runs 115X MORE trials, finding 10-20X MORE breakthroughs

Both are conservative estimates based on proven models (RECOVERY trial costs, disease prevalence data, standard QALY valuations).

**For detailed analysis including the 7-year access model, research capacity calculations, benefit breakdown table, and sanity checks**, see [1% Treaty ROI Tiers - Detailed Analysis](appendix/1-percent-treaty-roi-tiers.qmd).

## How This Compares to History

### Better Than the Best Charities

Let's compare to the most effective charities in the world (GiveWell top charities):

| Intervention | Cost to Achieve Outcome | Our Initiative's Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GiveWell Top Charities** (e.g., Against Malaria Foundation) | Spend **~`${python} f'${GIVEWELL_COST_PER_LIFE_MIN:,.0f} - ${GIVEWELL_COST_PER_LIFE_MAX:,.0f}'`** to save one life | Generate **`{python} format_qalys(GLOBAL_DFDA_QALYS_GAINED_ANNUAL)` QALYs** annually while creating **`{python} format_billions(DFDA_NPV_NET_BENEFIT_CONSERVATIVE)`** in net economic value |

**The Difference**: GiveWell's charities are the best ways to spend money to save lives. They cost money but save lives very efficiently.

This plan doesn't cost money, it *makes* money while saving lives. Instead of asking people to donate, it makes everyone richer while curing diseases.

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend `${python} f'${GIVEWELL_COST_PER_LIFE_MIN:,.0f}-${GIVEWELL_COST_PER_LIFE_MAX:,.0f}'` to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society `${python} f'${abs(COST_PER_LIFE_INVESTOR_FUNDED):.2f}'` million per life saved**.

### Better Than History's Best Public Health Wins

| Intervention | How it Creates Value | Scale of Annual Net Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Childhood Vaccinations** | Prevents immense long-term treatment costs for diseases like measles and polio | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Smoking Cessation** | Prevents expensive chronic diseases (cancer, heart disease) through low-cost interventions | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Water Fluoridation** | Avoids dental care costs for entire populations at negligible cost | Hundreds of Millions to Billions |
| **1% Treaty (Peace Dividend)** | Reduces global conflict costs by 1%, creating massive economic benefit | **~`{python} format_billions(PEACE_DIVIDEND_ANNUAL_SOCIETAL_BENEFIT)`, Annually** |
| **dFDA (R&D Efficiency)** | Makes clinical research ~`{python} TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_FACTOR`}x more efficient, unlocking huge R&D savings | **~`{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS_ANNUAL)`, Annually** |

**Why This Is Different:**

Vaccines and smoking cessation programs are amazing—they solve specific problems with a high return.

The 1% Treaty and dFDA initiative tackles two problems at once:

1. **The Peace Dividend** is a massive economic gain on par with the largest public health wins, created simply by reducing a global negative (conflict)
2. **The dFDA** then uses a tiny fraction of that gain to fix the *system* of medical research, generating a *second* massive win

Instead of solving one problem, this uses a global-scale win to fund a system-scale win. When you redirect the world's largest source of waste to fund its most impactful opportunity, the math gets wild.

### 10X Bigger Than Childhood Vaccinations

{{< include ../figures/health-programs-vs-1-percent-treaty-societal-benefits-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The `{python} format_billions(TREATY_TOTAL_ANNUAL_BENEFITS)` annual economic benefit (conservative case) makes this intervention nearly **`{python} f"{TREATY_BENEFIT_MULTIPLIER_VS_VACCINES:.0f}×"` larger than childhood vaccinations** (one of the most successful public health programs in history).

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors `{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` annual returns.

## The Opportunity Cost Clock

Every second we don't implement this system:

- **`${python} f'${ENDGAME_BENEFIT_PER_SECOND:,.0f}'`** in value destroyed
- **`{python} f"{COST_OF_DELAY_QALY_DAYS_PER_SECOND:.1f}"` quality life-days** lost
- **`{python} f"{COST_OF_DELAY_DEATHS_PER_SECOND:.3f}"` preventable deaths** occur

By the time you finish reading this sentence, we've lost roughly `{python} format_currency(ENDGAME_BENEFIT_PER_SECOND * 4)`.

Every day we delay:

- **`{python} format_billions(ENDGAME_BENEFIT_PER_DAY)`** in potential value evaporates
- **`{python} format_qalys(GLOBAL_DAILY_DEATHS_CURABLE_DISEASES)`** people die who could have been saved
- **`{python} format_qalys(GLOBAL_DAILY_DEATHS_CURABLE_DISEASES)`** suffer from curable diseases
- **Your personal risk** of preventable death increases

Every year we wait is `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ENDGAME_BENEFITS_ANNUAL)` lit on fire.
Every day is `{python} format_billions(ENDGAME_BENEFIT_PER_DAY)` wasted.
Every hour is `{python} format_currency(ENDGAME_BENEFIT_PER_HOUR)` gone.

The `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ENDGAME_BENEFITS_ANNUAL)` isn't a dream. It's the mathematical consequence of redirecting humanity's resources from destruction to construction, from killing to curing, from war to wellness.

## The Choice

Humanity can keep spending `{python} format_currency(TOTAL_GLOBAL_WASTE_SPEND_ANNUAL)` on war and disease.
Or it can make between `{python} format_billions(TREATY_TOTAL_ANNUAL_BENEFITS)` and `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ENDGAME_BENEFITS_ANNUAL)` per year ending both.

The ROI ranges from `{python} format_roi(ROI_DFDA_SAVINGS_ONLY)` to `{python} format_roi(ROI_WITH_MULTIPLIER_EFFECTS)`, depending on what you count.
