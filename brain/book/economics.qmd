## TL;DR: Three Ways to Calculate the Return

Depending on what you count, the 1% Treaty generates between `{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_1_CONSERVATIVE)` and `{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_3_ENDGAME)` ROI:

**`{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_1_CONSERVATIVE)` = Conservative (dFDA R&D Savings Only)**
- Only counts the `{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS)` in annual R&D cost reductions from 82X cheaper trials
- Ignores peace dividend, earlier access, and all secondary benefits
- NPV-based, 10-year timeframe
- This is the floor

**`{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_2_COMPLETE)` = Complete (All Direct Benefits)**
- Counts all 8 primary benefit categories totaling `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_COMPLETE_BENEFITS)`/year
- Includes peace dividend, R&D savings, earlier access, research acceleration, rare diseases, drug prices, prevention, and mental health
- 10-year average
- This is the realistic case

**`{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_3_ENDGAME)` = Endgame (Year 20 Compounding)**
- Adds all secondary multiplier effects: productivity gains, global trade, infrastructure preservation, avoided crises, innovation acceleration
- Reaches `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ENDGAME_BENEFITS)` annual value at maturity
- This is where we're actually headed

**Which one should you cite?**
- Conservative audience: Use `{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_1_CONSERVATIVE)`
- Complete pitch: Use `{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_2_COMPLETE)`
- True believers: Use `{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_3_ENDGAME)`

All three are correct. They just count different things.

## The Conservative Case: `{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_1_CONSERVATIVE)` ROI (dFDA Only)

If we ONLY count the cheapest, most conservative benefit—making clinical trials 82X cheaper—here's what we get:

### The Numbers

All calculations in our [Economic Models Notebook](./economics/economic_models.ipynb).

**The Funding Source (Peace Dividend):**
- **Captured Dividend**: 1% of global military spending = **$27.18 billion annually** to fund the initiative
- **Societal Dividend**: Same 1% reduction generates **`{python} format_billions(SOCIETAL_DIVIDEND)` in annual economic value** through decreased conflict costs

**The Investment (dFDA Infrastructure):**
- **Total Cost (NPV)**: 10-year discounted cost to build and operate = **$0.56 billion**
- **Funding Sustainability**: Annual captured dividend (`{python} format_billions(CAPTURED_DIVIDEND)`) covers annual operational cost (`{python} format_millions(DFDA_ANNUAL_OPEX)`) **679 times over**

**The Return (Health & Wealth):**
- **Economic Return (NPV)**: 10-year discounted net benefit = **$249 billion** in R&D savings alone
- **Robust ROI**: $249B / $0.56B = **`{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_1_CONSERVATIVE)`**
- **Health Return**: **840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** annually

**Bottom Line**: The treaty takes 1% of what humanity spends on bombs and redirects it to cure diseases instead. This creates two massive, independent wins:

1. **The Peace Dividend**: Society gets **`{python} format_billions(SOCIETAL_DIVIDEND)`** richer every year from slightly less conflict
2. **The dFDA Bonus**: We use a fraction of that dividend to unlock **`{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS)`** in R&D savings annually, plus 840,000 years of healthy life

**Total Annual Benefit: ~`{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ANNUAL_BENEFITS)` per year.**

*Even in worst-case scenarios, the system achieves ROI between **375:1 and 3,500:1**.*

### Why This ROI Beats History

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves **`{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_1_CONSERVATIVE)` return on investment**.

This exceptional ROI comes from:
- **`{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS)` in annual R&D cost savings**: 82X reduction in clinical trial costs
- **Faster access to new treatments**: 2 years instead of 17 years to market
- **Better prevention through real-world data**: Continuous learning from millions of patients
- **Enabling new therapies**: Making rare disease trials economically viable

{{< include ../figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

This beats history's greatest public health achievements:
- Smallpox eradication: 280:1
- Childhood vaccinations: 13:1
- Water fluoridation: 23:1

### Infinite ROI When Funded by Military Redirection

{{< include ../figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

When funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**.

**Why the ROI is literally infinite** ([see full calculation](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)):

- **Zero net cost**: The `{python} format_billions(CAPTURED_DIVIDEND)` comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **`{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ANNUAL_BENEFITS)` in annual benefits**: Peace dividend (`{python} format_billions(SOCIETAL_DIVIDEND)`) + R&D savings (`{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS)`)
- **Operating costs**: Only `{python} format_millions(TOTAL_ANNUAL_COSTS)`/year (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: 25,000/year (875,000 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **The math**: `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ANNUAL_BENEFITS)` benefit ÷ $0 new spending = ∞ (infinite ROI)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS $6.56 million instead of spending

This is a **dominant health intervention**: it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives.

Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ANNUAL_BENEFITS)` annually while saving 25,000 lives.

## The Complete Case: `{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_2_COMPLETE)` ROI (All Direct Benefits)

The conservative `{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_1_CONSERVATIVE)` calculation only counts dFDA R&D savings. But the 1% Treaty does much more.

### `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_COMPLETE_BENEFITS)` in Annual Benefits

When you count all eight primary benefit categories:

1. **Peace dividend** ($97B) - Societal savings from 1% less conflict
2. **R&D cost savings** (`{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS)`) - 82X cheaper trials
3. **7-year access acceleration** ($300B) - Earlier treatment access during trials
4. **Research acceleration** ($100B) - 115X more research capacity (10-20X more breakthroughs)
5. **Rare disease treatments** ($400B) - Economically viable orphan drug development
6. **Drug price reductions** (`{python} format_billions(GLOBAL_TRIAL_MARKET)`) - R&D savings passed to consumers
7. **Prevention medicine** (`{python} format_billions(GLOBAL_TRIAL_MARKET)`) - Economically viable prevention trials
8. **Mental health** ($75B) - Closing the treatment gap

**Total: `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_COMPLETE_BENEFITS)`/year in quantifiable benefits = `{python} format_roi(ROI_TIER_2_COMPLETE)` ROI**

The two largest contributors—**earlier access acceleration** and **research capacity expansion**—are often misunderstood as the same thing. They're not:

- **Earlier Access** = Patients access the SAME treatments 7 years sooner (during trials instead of post-approval)
- **Research Acceleration** = System runs 115X MORE trials, finding 10-20X MORE breakthroughs

Both are conservative estimates based on proven models (RECOVERY trial costs, disease prevalence data, standard QALY valuations).

**For detailed analysis including the 7-year access model, research capacity calculations, benefit breakdown table, and sanity checks**, see [1% Treaty ROI Tiers - Detailed Analysis](appendix/1-percent-treaty-roi-tiers.qmd).

## How This Compares to History

### Better Than the Best Charities

Let's compare to the most effective charities in the world (GiveWell top charities):

| Intervention | Cost to Achieve Outcome | Our Initiative's Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GiveWell Top Charities** (e.g., Against Malaria Foundation) | Spend **~$3,000 - $5,000** to save one life | Generate **840,000 QALYs** annually while creating **$249 Billion** in net economic value |

**The Difference**: GiveWell's charities are the best ways to spend money to save lives. They cost money but save lives very efficiently.

This plan doesn't cost money, it *makes* money while saving lives. Instead of asking people to donate, it makes everyone richer while curing diseases.

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend $3,500-5,500 to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society $6.56 million per life saved**.

### Better Than History's Best Public Health Wins

| Intervention | How it Creates Value | Scale of Annual Net Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Childhood Vaccinations** | Prevents immense long-term treatment costs for diseases like measles and polio | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Smoking Cessation** | Prevents expensive chronic diseases (cancer, heart disease) through low-cost interventions | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Water Fluoridation** | Avoids dental care costs for entire populations at negligible cost | Hundreds of Millions to Billions |
| **1% Treaty (Peace Dividend)** | Reduces global conflict costs by 1%, creating massive economic benefit | **~`{python} format_billions(SOCIETAL_DIVIDEND)`, Annually** |
| **dFDA (R&D Efficiency)** | Makes clinical research ~80x more efficient, unlocking huge R&D savings | **~`{python} format_billions(DFDA_GROSS_SAVINGS)`, Annually** |

**Why This Is Different:**

Vaccines and smoking cessation programs are amazing—they solve specific problems with a high return.

The 1% Treaty and dFDA initiative tackles two problems at once:

1. **The Peace Dividend** is a massive economic gain on par with the largest public health wins, created simply by reducing a global negative (conflict)
2. **The dFDA** then uses a tiny fraction of that gain to fix the *system* of medical research, generating a *second* massive win

Instead of solving one problem, this uses a global-scale win to fund a system-scale win. When you redirect the world's largest source of waste to fund its most impactful opportunity, the math gets wild.

### 10X Bigger Than Childhood Vaccinations

{{< include ../figures/health-programs-vs-1-percent-treaty-societal-benefits-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ANNUAL_BENEFITS)` annual economic benefit (conservative case) makes this intervention nearly **11× larger than childhood vaccinations** (one of the most successful public health programs in history).

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors `{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` annual returns.

## The Opportunity Cost Clock

Every second we don't implement this system:

- **$522,539** in value destroyed
- **26.6 quality life-days** lost
- **0.018 preventable deaths** occur

By the time you finish reading this sentence, we've lost $2 million.

Every day we delay:

- **$45.2 billion** in potential value evaporates
- **410 people** die who could have been saved
- **150,000** suffer from curable diseases
- **Your personal risk** of preventable death increases

Every year we wait is `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ENDGAME_BENEFITS)` lit on fire.
Every day is $45 billion wasted.
Every hour is $1.9 billion gone.

The `{python} format_billions(TOTAL_ENDGAME_BENEFITS)` isn't a dream. It's the mathematical consequence of redirecting humanity's resources from destruction to construction, from killing to curing, from war to wellness.
