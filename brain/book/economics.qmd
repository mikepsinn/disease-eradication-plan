This isn't charity. This is the most profitable hostile takeover in history.

We're going to buy the military-industrial complex with its own money and make them build hospitals instead of bombs. Everyone makes more money. Everyone lives longer. Even the defense contractors get richer.

**The Math That Makes Billionaires Cry (Happy Tears):**

- Investment: $3.375 billion in VICTORY Bonds
- Return: 40% annually, forever
- ROI on society: 463:1 (every $1 invested saves $463 in costs)
- Lives saved: 180,000+ annually at just 1% reallocation
- Jobs lost: Zero (same companies, different products)

The beautiful part: We're bribing the exact same people who profit from war to profit more from peace. Defense contractors make 8% margins on missiles. We're offering 40% returns on medicine. Even Raytheon can do that math.

**The Coalition We're Building:**

1. **Defense Contractors:** 40% returns > 8% margins on bombs
2. **Insurance Companies:** Healthy people don't file claims
3. **Big Pharma:** 82X more drugs to sell = 82X more profits
4. **Politicians:** Our PAC money > their PAC money
5. **Billionaires:** Live forever AND get richer

This chapter explains how everyone wins, especially the bastards currently getting rich from death.
