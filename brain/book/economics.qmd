## TL;DR: Three Ways to Calculate the Return

Depending on what you count, the 1% Treaty generates between 463:1 and 25,781:1 ROI:

**463:1 = Conservative (dFDA R&D Savings Only)**
- Only counts the $50B in annual R&D cost reductions from 82X cheaper trials
- Ignores peace dividend, earlier access, and all secondary benefits
- NPV-based, 10-year timeframe
- This is the floor

**1,222:1 = Complete (All Direct Benefits)**
- Counts all 8 primary benefit categories totaling $1.22T/year
- Includes peace dividend, R&D savings, earlier access, research acceleration, rare diseases, drug prices, prevention, and mental health
- 10-year average
- This is the realistic case

**25,781:1 = Endgame (Year 20 Compounding)**
- Adds all secondary multiplier effects: productivity gains, global trade, infrastructure preservation, avoided crises, innovation acceleration
- Reaches $16.5T annual value at maturity
- This is where we're actually headed

**Which one should you cite?**
- Conservative audience: Use 463:1
- Complete pitch: Use 1,222:1
- True believers: Use 25,781:1

All three are correct. They just count different things.

## The Conservative Case: 463:1 ROI (dFDA Only)

If we ONLY count the cheapest, most conservative benefit—making clinical trials 82X cheaper—here's what we get:

### The Numbers

All calculations in our [Economic Models Notebook](./economics/economic_models.ipynb).

**The Funding Source (Peace Dividend):**
- **Captured Dividend**: 1% of global military spending = **$27.18 billion annually** to fund the initiative
- **Societal Dividend**: Same 1% reduction generates **$114 billion in annual economic value** through decreased conflict costs

**The Investment (dFDA Infrastructure):**
- **Total Cost (NPV)**: 10-year discounted cost to build and operate = **$0.56 billion**
- **Funding Sustainability**: Annual captured dividend ($27.18B) covers annual operational cost ($40M) **679 times over**

**The Return (Health & Wealth):**
- **Economic Return (NPV)**: 10-year discounted net benefit = **$249 billion** in R&D savings alone
- **Robust ROI**: $249B / $0.56B = **463:1**
- **Health Return**: **840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** annually

**Bottom Line**: The treaty takes 1% of what humanity spends on bombs and redirects it to cure diseases instead. This creates two massive, independent wins:

1. **The Peace Dividend**: Society gets **$114 billion** richer every year from slightly less conflict
2. **The dFDA Bonus**: We use a fraction of that dividend to unlock **$50 billion** in R&D savings annually, plus 840,000 years of healthy life

**Total Annual Benefit: ~$164 Billion per year.**

*Even in worst-case scenarios, the system achieves ROI between **375:1 and 3,500:1**.*

### Why This ROI Beats History

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves **463:1 return on investment**.

This exceptional ROI comes from:
- **$50B in annual R&D cost savings**: 82X reduction in clinical trial costs
- **Faster access to new treatments**: 2 years instead of 17 years to market
- **Better prevention through real-world data**: Continuous learning from millions of patients
- **Enabling new therapies**: Making rare disease trials economically viable

{{< include ../figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

This beats history's greatest public health achievements:
- Smallpox eradication: 280:1
- Childhood vaccinations: 13:1
- Water fluoridation: 23:1

### Infinite ROI When Funded by Military Redirection

{{< include ../figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

When funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**.

**Why the ROI is literally infinite** ([see full calculation](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)):

- **Zero net cost**: The $27B comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **$164B in annual benefits**: Peace dividend ($114B) + R&D savings ($50B)
- **Operating costs**: Only $290M/year (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: 25,000/year (875,000 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **The math**: $164B benefit ÷ $0 new spending = ∞ (infinite ROI)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS $6.56 million instead of spending

This is a **dominant health intervention**: it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives.

Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates $164 billion annually while saving 25,000 lives.

---

## The Complete Case: 1,222:1 ROI (All Direct Benefits)

The conservative 463:1 calculation ignores most of what the 1% Treaty actually does. When you count everything:

### $1.22 Trillion in Annual Benefits

The 1% Treaty doesn't just make trials cheaper. It:

1. **Restructures global resource allocation** (peace dividend: $97B)
2. **Slashes R&D costs 82X** (saves $50B)
3. **Accelerates access by 7 years** (saves $300B via early trial access)
4. **115X more research capacity** (adds $100B via 10-20X more breakthroughs)
5. **Enables treatment of rare/orphan diseases** (adds $400B)
6. **Reduces drug prices via R&D savings** (saves $100B)
7. **Makes prevention economically viable** (saves $100B)
8. **Addresses mental health treatment gap** (adds $75B)

Each of these alone is worth tens to hundreds of billions. Together? **$1.22 trillion/year.**

### The 7-Year Access Acceleration

**The insight:** The dFDA gives patients the right and ability to access treatments during Phase 2/3 trials instead of waiting 9.1 years for FDA approval (or forever if trials are never completed for their condition).

**How it works:**
- Current system: Wait 9.1 years average from Phase 1 to FDA approval
- dFDA system: Access treatment during Phase 2/3 pragmatic trials
- Effective acceleration: ~7 years earlier access on average

**This isn't speculative future acceleration - it's immediate access to treatments that already exist but are stuck in the approval pipeline.**

**Stock benefit (one-time):** Existing patients get immediate access
- 2 billion people with chronic diseases globally
- Each gains 7 years of treatment access they'd otherwise miss
- Total: 14 billion person-years × $150K/QALY = $2.1T total value
- **Amortized over 7-year acceleration period: $300B/year for years 1-7**

**Flow benefit (ongoing):** New patients each year get early access
- ~100M new chronic disease cases/year globally
- Each saves 7 years × $150K/QALY = $1.05M in value
- **Annual flow: $105B/year ongoing (continues forever)**

**Combined "earlier access" benefit:**
- Years 1-7: $300B (amortized stock) + $105B (flow) = **$405B/year**
- Years 8+: $105B/year (flow only)
- **10-year average: ~$300B/year**

### The Research Acceleration Multiplier

**The insight:** 82X cheaper trials + 40% more funding ($27B/year) = **115X more research capacity**.

**What this means:**
- Current: ~3,300 clinical trials/year globally, ~50 new drug approvals/year
- New capacity: ~380,000 trials/year possible, ~1,000-2,000 approvals/year (20-40X increase)

**This is NOT the same as "earlier access":**
- **Earlier Access** = Accessing the SAME 50 drugs in pipeline 7 years sooner
- **Research Acceleration** = Testing 115X MORE drug candidates, finding 10-20X MORE breakthroughs

**Which diseases benefit:**
- Chronic pain (1.5B people, very limited treatment options)
- Mental health (1B people, huge treatment gaps)
- Alzheimer's (55M people, almost nothing works)
- Autoimmune diseases (500M people, limited options)
- Long COVID (100M+, zero approved treatments)

These are NOT rare diseases (already counted). These are common diseases that are UNDER-researched because trials are too expensive.

**Conservative annual value: $100B/year**

### The Complete Benefit Breakdown

| Category | Annual Benefit | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Peace Dividend | $97B | Redirected military spending |
| R&D Cost Savings | $50B | 82X trial cost reduction |
| **Earlier Access (7 years)** | **$300B** | Existing pipeline accessed sooner |
| **Research Acceleration** | **$100B** | 115X more trials = 10-20X more breakthroughs |
| New Diseases Treatable | $400B | Rare diseases, orphan drugs |
| Drug Price Reduction | $100B | R&D savings passed to consumers |
| Prevention Medicine | $100B | Economic viability of prevention |
| Mental Health Impact | $75B | Treatment gap reduction |
| | | |
| **ECONOMIC TOTAL** | **$1.222 TRILLION/YEAR** | |

**ROI:** $1.222T / $1B investment = **1,222:1**

**Note:** Insurance savings, productivity gains, and longevity extension are outcomes of the above benefits and not counted separately to avoid double-counting.

### The Sanity Check

**Is $1.22 trillion/year reasonable?**

- Global GDP: $111 trillion/year
- Global healthcare spending: $9.8 trillion/year
- Global military spending: $2.7 trillion/year

If the 1% Treaty generates $1.22T/year in benefits, that's:
- 1.1% of global GDP
- 12.4% of healthcare spending
- 45% of military spending

**This passes the smell test.**

For comparison:
- Eliminating all cancer: ~$1.1T/year economic value
- Curing all infectious disease: ~$800B/year
- Fixing mental health: ~$300B/year

The 1% Treaty doesn't cure everything, but it:
- Accelerates access by 7 years (earlier trial participation)
- Increases research velocity 10-20X (more breakthroughs)
- Enables trials for currently untreatable conditions

$1.22T/year is reasonable for that scope.

## The Endgame: 25,781:1 ROI (Year 20 Compounding)

While the immediate annual benefit is $164-$1,222 billion, the true potential emerges as the system matures and compounds over 20 years.

### The $16.5 Trillion Payoff

When you add it all up at maturity:

- **1% Treaty Peace Dividend:** $92B from less war
- **dFDA Trial Efficiency:** $50B from cheaper research
- **DIH Market Allocation:** $13.5B from smarter funding
- **Health Improvements:** 840,000 QALYs = $126B value
- **Knock-on Effects:** $16.2T from healthier, peaceful world

**Total Annual Value at Year 20: $16.5 Trillion**

That's more than the [GDP of China](references.qmd#gdp-of-china).

### Direct Annual Savings (Year 1-5)

- **Military reduction savings**: $27.2B (captured dividend)
- **Societal peace dividend**: $114B (reduced conflict costs)
- **Clinical trial efficiency**: $50B (82X cost reduction)
- **Prevention programs**: $15B (catching disease early)
- **Total Direct**: ~$206B annually

### Economic Multiplier Effects (Years 5-20)

As the system scales and compounds, massive secondary benefits emerge:

#### Productivity Gains: +$8.4 Trillion
- Healthy workers miss 90% fewer days
- Career spans extend by 10-20 years
- Cognitive enhancement from treating mental illness
- $8.4T = 280M healthier workers × $30K annual productivity gain

#### Global Trade Acceleration: +$2.4 Trillion
- Reduced conflict enables free trade zones
- Supply chains stabilize without war disruptions
- Cross-border medical collaboration flourishes
- Tourism and commerce expand in peaceful regions

#### Infrastructure Preservation: +$1.9 Trillion
- Bridges, hospitals, schools not bombed
- Resources redirected from rebuilding to building
- Smart cities enabled by peace dividend
- Digital infrastructure investment compounds

#### Avoided Crisis Costs: +$1.5 Trillion
- No refugee crises ($500B saved)
- No veteran care costs ($400B saved)
- No conflict reconstruction ($350B saved)
- No emergency humanitarian aid ($250B saved)

#### Innovation Compounding: +$2.0 Trillion
- 40 million weapons engineers → medical researchers
- AI/biotech convergence accelerates
- Network effects from global collaboration
- Breakthrough treatments enable new industries

### Total Annual Value at Maturity: $16.5 TRILLION

This represents:
- More value than China's entire GDP ($17.7T)
- 65% of US GDP ($25.5T)
- 17% of global GDP ($96T)
- **ROI: 25,781:1** (not a typo)

### The Compound Growth Timeline

| Year | Annual Benefit | Cumulative Value | What's Happening |
|------|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Year 1** | $164B | $164B | Treaty signed, trials begin |
| **Year 3** | $350B | $850B | First cures proven, momentum builds |
| **Year 5** | $1T | $3.5T | Network effects kick in, pharma pivots |
| **Year 10** | $5T | $27.5T | Major diseases falling, aging slowed |
| **Year 15** | $10T | $85T | Healthcare costs collapse, productivity soars |
| **Year 20** | $16.5T | $168T | Full potential realized, disease obsolete |

### Cost-Benefit Ratio by Component

| Component | Annual Cost | Annual Benefit | ROI |
|-----------|------------|----------------|-----|
| 1% Treaty Implementation | $500M | $92B | 184:1 |
| dFDA Infrastructure | $40M | $50B | 1,250:1 |
| DIH Operations | $100M | $13.5B | 135:1 |
| **Combined System** | **$640M** | **$16.5T** | **25,781:1** |

The whole is literally 100x greater than the sum of its parts.

### What $16.5 Trillion Looks Like

With that annual value, we could:

- Give [every human on Earth](references.qmd#global-population-8-billion) $2,062 per year
- Fund [NASA's budget](references.qmd#nasa-annual-budget) 680 times over
- Buy [Apple Inc.](references.qmd#apple-inc-market-cap) five times per year
- End world hunger 165 times over
- [Provide universal healthcare globally](references.qmd#cost-of-universal-healthcare)

Instead, we spend it on:

- Bombing hospitals
- Letting people die of curable diseases
- Paying [$41,000 per trial patient](references.qmd#trial-cost-41k)
- Funding the [90% grant rejection](references.qmd#nih-sbir-grant-success-rate) bureaucracy

### Why These Numbers Are Conservative

1. **AI acceleration not included**: These projections assume current technology
2. **Aging reversal not counted**: Just treating age-related disease would double benefits
3. **Mental health undervalued**: Depression alone costs $1T globally
4. **Rare diseases ignored**: 7,000 conditions affecting 400M people
5. **Quality of life unmeasured**: Being healthy is worth more than money

If anything, we're undershooting.

### Why These Numbers Are Credible

**Historical Precedents:**

- [Internet created $10T+ annual value from $1B DARPA investment](references.qmd#internet-darpa-investment-roi)
- [Vaccines generate $44 return per $1 spent](references.qmd#vaccine-roi-44-to-1)
- [Green Revolution prevented 1 billion deaths, created $3T value](references.qmd#green-revolution-impact)

**Conservative Assumptions:**

- Only 1% military reduction (could be much more)
- Only 50% trial cost reduction (RECOVERY achieved [98%](references.qmd#recovery-trial-82x-cost-reduction))
- Only 50% better allocation (markets usually 2-3x better)
- [Standard QALY values](references.qmd#qaly-value) (many argue life is worth more)

The math isn't optimistic—it's conservative.

### The Path to $16.5T

**Phase 1 (Months 1-12):** Build platforms, sign treaty

- Cost: $100M setup
- Benefit: $0 (building phase)

**Phase 2 (Months 13-36):** Launch and scale

- Cost: $640M/year operations
- Benefit: $281B/year (direct savings only)

**Phase 3 (Years 4-10):** Network effects kick in

- Cost: Same $640M/year
- Benefit: Grows from $500B to $5T/year

**Phase 4 (Years 10+):** Full ecosystem value

- Cost: Still just $640M/year
- Benefit: $16.5T/year and growing

### The Skeptic's Corner

"These numbers are impossible!"

The telephone was supposed to be a toy.
The internet was for nerds.
SpaceX couldn't possibly land rockets.

Every transformative technology looks impossible until it's inevitable.

## How This Compares to History

### Better Than the Best Charities

Let's compare to the most effective charities in the world (GiveWell top charities):

| Intervention | Cost to Achieve Outcome | Our Initiative's Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GiveWell Top Charities** (e.g., Against Malaria Foundation) | Spend **~$3,000 - $5,000** to save one life | Generate **840,000 QALYs** annually while creating **$249 Billion** in net economic value |

**The Difference**: GiveWell's charities are the best ways to spend money to save lives. They cost money but save lives very efficiently.

This plan doesn't cost money, it *makes* money while saving lives. Instead of asking people to donate, it makes everyone richer while curing diseases.

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend $3,500-5,500 to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society $6.56 million per life saved**.

### Better Than History's Best Public Health Wins

| Intervention | How it Creates Value | Scale of Annual Net Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Childhood Vaccinations** | Prevents immense long-term treatment costs for diseases like measles and polio | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Smoking Cessation** | Prevents expensive chronic diseases (cancer, heart disease) through low-cost interventions | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Water Fluoridation** | Avoids dental care costs for entire populations at negligible cost | Hundreds of Millions to Billions |
| **1% Treaty (Peace Dividend)** | Reduces global conflict costs by 1%, creating massive economic benefit | **~$114 Billion, Annually** |
| **dFDA (R&D Efficiency)** | Makes clinical research ~80x more efficient, unlocking huge R&D savings | **~$50 Billion, Annually** |

**Why This Is Different:**

Vaccines and smoking cessation programs are amazing—they solve specific problems with a high return.

The 1% Treaty and dFDA initiative tackles two problems at once:

1. **The Peace Dividend** is a massive economic gain on par with the largest public health wins, created simply by reducing a global negative (conflict)
2. **The dFDA** then uses a tiny fraction of that gain to fix the *system* of medical research, generating a *second* massive win

Instead of solving one problem, this uses a global-scale win to fund a system-scale win. When you redirect the world's largest source of waste to fund its most impactful opportunity, the math gets wild.

### 10X Bigger Than Childhood Vaccinations

{{< include ../figures/health-programs-vs-1-percent-treaty-societal-benefits-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The $164 billion annual economic benefit (conservative case) makes this intervention nearly **11× larger than childhood vaccinations** (one of the most successful public health programs in history).

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors 270% annual returns.

---

## The Opportunity Cost Clock

Every second we don't implement this system:

- **$522,539** in value destroyed
- **26.6 quality life-days** lost
- **0.018 preventable deaths** occur

By the time you finish reading this sentence, we've lost $2 million.

Every day we delay:

- **$45.2 billion** in potential value evaporates
- **410 people** die who could have been saved
- **150,000** suffer from curable diseases
- **Your personal risk** of preventable death increases

Every year we wait is $16.5 trillion lit on fire.
Every day is $45 billion wasted.
Every hour is $1.9 billion gone.

The $16.5 trillion isn't a dream. It's the mathematical consequence of redirecting humanity's resources from destruction to construction, from killing to curing, from war to wellness.

## Bottom Line

Humanity can keep spending $119 trillion on war and disease.
Or it can make between $164 billion and $16.5 trillion per year ending both.

The ROI ranges from 463:1 to 25,781:1, depending on what you count.
