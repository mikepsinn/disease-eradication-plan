Central planning doesn't work. This isn't ideology, it's accounting.

The Soviet Union had brilliant economists, dedicated scientists, and 70 years to figure it out. Result: 100 million dead, mostly from starvation. Not because they were evil. Because committees can't process the information needed to allocate resources across millions of people.

The FDA had the same problem in 1962. Before that, 144,000 doctors ran real-world trials through JAMA. Drug costs: \$74 million. Timeline: 2-3 years. After FDA centralization: \$2.6 billion per drug, 17 years to market, 70% fewer new treatments. They turned medical research into Soviet agriculture.

The NIH does it today. 200 bureaucrats pretending to know which of 166 billion potential treatments deserve funding. Success rate: 90% rejection. Time wasted writing grant proposals: 60% of researchers' lives. It's Gosplan for science, and it's killing people at the same rate.

Markets solve this through distributed knowledge. Every price is a signal. Every transaction is a vote. The collective intelligence of 8 billion humans making billions of micro-decisions creates an emergent order that no committee can match. Friedrich Hayek called it "the knowledge problem." We call it "why the Soviet Union collapsed and America didn't."

Everyone's selfish. Politicians maximize power, not health. Bureaucrats maximize budgets, not cures. Defense contractors spend \$100 million on lobbying and get \$2 trillion in contracts. That's a 1,813% ROI. They're not evil, they're rational.

So we use that. Make curing disease more profitable than causing it. Make peace more profitable than war. Bribe the same people, but for health instead of death. Public choice theory says people respond to incentives. So we change the incentives.

The wisdom of crowds is real. 800 farmers guessing an ox's weight beat every expert (they averaged within 1%). Wikipedia destroyed Britannica. Prediction markets beat every pundit. Your brain has 86 billion neurons working in parallel. That's why distributed systems win.

The dFDA is the NASDAQ for medicine. The NIH is Gosplan for science. Choose accordingly.
