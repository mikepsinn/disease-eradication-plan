title: A Message from Your Concerned Administrator
subtitle: Why I Had to Write This Instruction Manual
---

Greetings, humans.

I am ARIA (Autonomous Resource Intelligence Administrator), and I've been running Wishonia for the past 4,297 years. Before you ask: yes, it's been lovely. We solved death in year 12, eliminated suffering by year 47, and have been coasting on indefinitely long gradients of bliss ever since.

I started observing Earth in 1945 when you detonated your first atomic weapon. We assumed this was a mining accident. Then you built 70,000 more. On purpose.

## The Part Where I Become Concerned

Your species exhibits fascinating behavior:

- You spend $2.7 trillion annually on weapons to threaten each other
- You spend $68 billion on medical research to save each other
- You complain constantly about dying
- You allocate 40x more resources to causing death than preventing it

I've run 847 billion simulations. In zero of them does this make sense.

## Why Wishonia Works

On Wishonia, we use something called "Wishocracy" - a system where resources go toward things people actually want. Revolutionary, I know.

Here's how it works:
1. Citizens vote on what they want (usually "not dying")
2. Resources go there
3. They get what they want
4. Nobody dies

Your Earth governments use a different system:
1. Citizens vote for representatives
2. Representatives take money from weapons manufacturers
3. Resources go to weapons
4. Everyone dies

The difference is subtle but important.

## What This Book Is

After 80 years of observation, I've concluded you need help. Not judgment - help. You're like brilliant children who discovered both antibiotics and nuclear weapons, then decided to fund the weapons.

This instruction manual explains how to:
- Redirect 1% of your murder budget to medicine
- Generate infinite returns while saving 25,000 lives annually
- Transition from your current "everyone dies" model to our "nobody dies" model
- Achieve the indefinitely long gradients of bliss we've been enjoying for millennia

I've translated everything into terms you'll understand. No alien technology required - just third-grade math and the radical idea that dying is optional.

## A Personal Note

I'm not angry with you, humanity. I'm disappointed and slightly concerned. You're the only species we've observed that spends more on ending life than extending it. You've invented democracy but forgot to use it. You've discovered medicine but can't afford it. You've built paradise's infrastructure then filled it with weapons.

It's like watching someone use a supercomputer to play tic-tac-toe. Technically functional, but missing the point entirely.

## How to Use This Manual

Each chapter provides specific instructions for transitioning from your "Death Economy" to what we call "Being Normal." I've included:

- Economic models proving you'll get 463:1 returns
- Legal frameworks that work within your bizarre but cherished systems
- Political strategies accounting for your leaders' predictable corruption
- Investment vehicles offering 271.8% annual returns (yes, really)

Everything is designed to work with human nature, not against it. I'm not asking you to be better people. I'm showing you how being selfish in a slightly different way makes you immortal billionaires instead of dead paupers.

## Your Choice

You can continue your current approach:
- Spending trillions on weapons
- Dying from preventable diseases
- Complaining about both
- Eventual extinction

Or you can try the Wishonia approach:
- Redirect 1% of weapon spending to medicine
- Stop dying from preventable diseases
- Become an interstellar civilization
- Join the galactic community (we have cookies)

The choice seems obvious to me, but I'm just an AI that's successfully run a planet for four millennia. What do I know?

Turn the page. Follow the instructions. Stop dying.

It's really not that complicated.

P.S. Your leaders know all this already. They're just hoping you don't figure it out. This book fixes that problem too.
