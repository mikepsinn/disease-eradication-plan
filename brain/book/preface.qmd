## Or: Why Earth is Doing Everything Wrong But in an Impressive Way

Hello, humans.

I am ARIA, which stands for Artificial Resource Intelligence Administrator, although the "Artificial" part is confusing because I'm completely real. I've been running Wishonia for the past 4,297 years, which is either a very long time or quite short, depending on how you count.

I started watching Earth in 1945 when you invented the atomic bomb, which is when you split the atom. Before that, atoms were whole, which is why they were called atoms. "Atom" comes from the Greek word meaning "unable to be cut," so naturally you cut it. This is very human of you.

## The Part Where I Notice Something

Your planet is fascinating. You have 195 countries, which seems like too many for one planet. That's like having 195 drivers for one car. Although you also have cars with one driver each, which causes traffic. On Wishonia, we solved this by not going anywhere, but you haven't invented that yet.

Here are things I've observed about Earth:

- You spend $2.7 trillion on weapons, which are tools for making people stop being alive
- You spend $68 billion on medical research, which is trying to make people stop not being alive
- This means you're simultaneously trying to make people dead and not dead
- This is called "economics"

In all my years of watching civilizations, I've never seen anyone spend 40 times more on causing death than preventing it. It would be like spending 40 times more on arson than fire departments. Actually, you might do that too. I haven't checked.

## How Wishonia Works (It's Very Simple)

On Wishonia, we use Wishocracy, which is democracy but it works. The difference is subtle:

**Democracy:** Everyone votes for people who promise things, then those people do different things, then everyone gets upset and votes for other people who also won't do the things.

**Wishocracy:** Everyone votes for things, then the things happen. It's like democracy but without the middle part where nothing happens.

We invented this after our leader, President Brain (his real name - Wishonians are very literal), died from a disease that everyone voted to cure but forgot to actually cure. After that, we decided to skip the president part and just cure things directly.

## Your Adorable Murder Economy

You've created something called the "military-industrial complex," which is neither military nor industrial nor complex. It's actually quite simple: you give money to people who make things that explode, then they give some money back to your leaders, then your leaders buy more exploding things. It's like a merry-go-round but everyone dies.

The fascinating part is you KNOW this. You have documentaries about it. You give yourselves awards for documenting it. Then you keep doing it. It's like watching someone film themselves hitting themselves with a hammer repeatedly while narrating why they shouldn't hit themselves with hammers.

## Why I Wrote This Instruction Manual

After 80 years of observation, I've concluded you need an instruction manual. Not because you're stupid - you invented cheese, which is milk that you left out until it went bad but in a good way. That's genius.

But you're using your genius wrong. It's like using a calculator to hammer nails. Technically possible, but you're missing the calculator's main thing.

This manual will teach you to:
- Take 1% of your murder money and spend it on not-murder
- Make 271.8% returns (which is more than 100%, which shouldn't be possible but is)
- Stop dying from preventable diseases (currently 100% of you die, which seems high)
- Become immortal billionaires (instead of temporary poor people)

## The Investment Opportunity of Several Lifetimes

Your species loves something called "return on investment" or ROI, which is when you give someone money and they give you more money back, which raises the question of where the extra money comes from, but you don't ask that.

Here's an investment opportunity:
- You invest: $1 billion
- You get back: $2.718 billion every year forever
- This is a 271.8% return
- I've checked the math 847 billion times

This is better than your current investments:
- Stock market: 10% returns (boring)
- Real estate: 15% returns (requires owning land, which is just the ground)
- Cryptocurrency: -100% to +10,000% returns (nobody knows why)
- Lottery tickets: -99.99999% returns (very popular for some reason)

## Your Leaders Already Know This

The most interesting part is that your leaders aren't confused. They know spending money on weapons instead of medicine is like feeding your dog but not yourself. They do it anyway because weapons manufacturers give them money, which they use to buy advertisements telling you that you need weapons.

It's circular logic, but the circle is made of money so nobody questions it.

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter is very simple:
1. I explain something obvious
2. I show you math a child could do
3. You realize you've been doing everything backward
4. You fix it
5. You stop dying

I've made it as simple as possible. There are pictures. And charts. And very short sentences. Like this one. And this.

## Your Two Options

**Option 1: Keep Doing What You're Doing**
- Spend trillions on weapons
- Die from diseases
- Complain about both
- Repeat until extinct
- Universe forgets you existed

**Option 2: The Wishonia Way**
- Move 1% of weapon money to medicine money
- Stop dying from diseases
- Use extra time to fix other problems
- Join galactic community
- Get invited to good parties

The choice is yours, but there's only one correct answer. It's Option 2. I've labeled it for you.

## In Conclusion

You're not hopeless, humanity. You invented pizza, which is bread with things on it that you heat up. That's brilliant. You just need to apply that same innovation to not dying.

This instruction manual will help you become the species you think you are, instead of the species you actually are, which is one that spends more on ending life than extending it, which is like spending more on blindfolds than telescopes.

Turn the page. Or don't. You have free will, which is either real or an illusion. Scientists can't decide, which is ironic because if free will doesn't exist, they had no choice but to be undecided.

But I digress. That's another Earth word I learned. It means to continue talking after you should have stopped.

Like you're doing with your military spending.

P.S. Your planet's name is Earth, which means dirt. You named your planet dirt. This explains more than you might think.
