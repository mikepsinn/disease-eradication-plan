```{python}

# Quarto executes from project root (execute-dir: project in _book.yml)
appendix_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'brain', 'book', 'appendix')

    sys.path.insert(0, appendix_path)

This isn't a protest. It's a business plan for a hostile takeover of humanity's priorities. The product is a longer, healthier life. The target is the global death industry. The strategy is a simple, three-step algorithm to bankrupt the status quo.

## Step 1: Acquire Capital

Raise **`{python} format_billions(TREATY_CAMPAIGN_TOTAL_COST)`** by selling **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**. The pitch is irresistible: a perpetual **`{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` annual return**, funded by redirecting a tiny fraction of the global war machine's budget. It's the greatest trade in financial history.

## Step 2: Weaponize Public Opinion

Use the capital to launch a **[global referendum](../strategy/global-referendum.qmd)** and bribe the public to participate. The goal: get **280 million people** (3.5% of the global population) to vote YES. This isn't a petition; it's a political kill list. History shows that no government on earth can withstand the focused pressure of 3.5% of its population.

## Step 3: Execute the Takeover

Use the public mandate and the remaining capital to **[buy the political establishment](../legal/election-law.qmd)**. With an army of 280 million voters and a war chest that makes the defense lobby look poor, you make supporting the treaty the only rational choice for any politician who wants to remain employed.

The result is inevitable: the **[1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** is ratified. The `{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)`-a-year river of cash is unlocked. Forever.

This isn't a revolution. It's an acquisition. And we will not be outbid.
