Our strategy isn't to convince anyone of anything. It's to make everyone richer.

**The 3-Step Murder of the Status Quo:**

**Step 1: MANDATE (Get 280 Million Humans)**
Get 3.5% of humanity to click "yes" on not dying. That's 280 million people. Sounds impossible? Wrong. Civil rights did it. Women's suffrage did it. Gandhi did it. And they didn't have the internet or the ability to promise people free healthcare.

**The 3.5% Rule:** Once 3.5% of any population actively supports something, politicians fold like wet paper. It's not a theory, it's historical fact. No movement with 3.5% active support has ever failed. Ever.

**Step 2: MONEY (Get $2.5 Billion)**
Sell VICTORY Bonds to rich people who want to get richer. Promise 40% returns (we can deliver because we're capturing $27B/year from military budgets). Use the money for:

- $1B: Legal bribes (lobbying)
- $1.35B: Propaganda (media)
- $675M: Build the tech

**Step 3: TREATY (Turn Votes Into Law)**
Deploy the billion dollars in lobbying. When 280 million voters want something AND you're spending more than defense contractors, politicians suddenly discover they've always cared about curing cancer.

Result: $27B/year automatically flows from military budgets to medical research. Forever.

**The Tech That Makes It Work:**

- **Blockchain:** So nobody can fake the votes or steal the money
- **Smart Contracts:** Money flows automatically, no middlemen
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Your medical data stays private while trials stay transparent
- **AI Matching:** Finds the right trial for you in seconds, not months
- **Open Source Everything:** No black boxes, no bullshit, no gatekeepers

This isn't idealism. It's math. And the math says we win.

## How Politics Actually Works

Politicians don't do things because they're moral. They do things because they get paid. Here's what we know about how this works:

- **People are greedy.** Politicians, corporate leaders, and voters choose whatever makes them richer or more powerful. Our strategy relies on this, not on people being good.

- **Small groups beat big groups.** A small group getting a lot of money will always fight harder than a big group losing a little money. We give the small groups massive benefits for supporting the treaty.

- **Politics is shopping.** Policy isn't decided by who has the best moral argument. It's decided by who offers the best deal. We're offering a better deal.

- **Everyone wants a cut.** Lobbyists and corporations will always try to grab money through politics. Instead of fighting this, we redirect it. We've created a new, more profitable way for them to get rich: the Peace Dividend.

We're not hoping people change. We're giving them better incentives.

## The Bribe Sequence: How We Pay Everyone Off

The strategy unfolds in a sequence of bribes, each one funding the next, creating an unstoppable coalition of self-interest.

### 1. The Bribe for Rich People

#### Phase 1: Seed Investors ($250-400M Initial Investment)

- **Who:** Wealthy individuals, funds, anchor investors, and the military-industrial complex itself.
- **The Bribe:** The most profitable investment opportunity in human history, modeled on the proven success of WWII War Bonds but with venture-capital-level returns.
- **40% Annual Returns:** **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)** are designed to beat the world's best hedge funds (e.g., Renaissance Medallion Fund's ~39% CAGR).
- **Money-Back Guarantee:** Initial funds are protected by an **[Assurance Contract](../economics/fundraising-strategy.qmd)**, guaranteeing a full refund if fundraising goals are not met.
- **The Result:** Defense contractors and billionaires make more money supporting peace than supporting war. So they support peace.

#### Our Superior Offer to Military Contractors:

1. **They Make More Money:** Direct investment in VICTORY bonds with >40% CAGR beats all alternative investment options
2. **They Get Better Security:** A healthier, more stable world is safer than one with overkill capacity creating existential risk  
3. **They Protect Their Families:** Their families get diseases too. They'd be better off profiting from funding cures rather than bombs
4. **Repurpose Their Lobbyists:** Instead of hiring new lobbyists, we legally bribe them with better returns to get their existing lobbying apparatus to push for the treaty

### 2. The Bribe for VICTORY Bond Buyers

#### Phase 2: VICTORY Bond Buyers ($100-200M Referendum Funding)

- **Who:** Early backers, health advocates, institutions
- **The Bribe:** VICTORY bonds representing earned ownership of real economic value created by the peace dividend
- **Governance control over $27B annually** in captured value from military budget redirection
- **Voting rights** on patient subsidies and research funding allocation  
- **Bond value backed by actual treasury growth** from when the treaty actually happens ($0 → $27B)

### 3. The Bribe for Regular People

#### Phase 3: Citizens (Global Population)

- **Who:** Global population (targeting 3.5% = 280 million people)
- **The Bribe:** A large grant of **VOTE points** for each referendum vote, your proof that you'll get paid real money. These represent your earned share of the $16.5 trillion annual peace dividend unlocked by redirecting military spending, convertible to **VICTORY bonds** after the 1% Treaty is ratified.
- **VOTE Points:** Every person who votes in our **[Global Referendum](./strategy/global-referendum/)** gets points. These aren't fake internet points. They represent real money.
- **You Get Paid:** After the treaty passes, those points become real ownership in the $27 billion annual health budget. You helped create it, you get a piece of it.
- **The Result:** Instead of a traditional protest where people wave signs and go home, we create 280 million people who have skin in the game. When 3.5% of the world's population wants something and will get paid for it, politicians listen.

### 4. The Bribe for Politicians

#### Phase 4: Politicians ($800M-1.5B Independent Expenditures)

- **Who:** Key legislators in target countries
- **The Bribe:** A package of personal wealth, political power, and a lasting legacy.

#### Our Superior Offer to Politicians:

- **Personal Investment Opportunity:** Politicians and their families can directly invest in [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) that pay better than anything else they can find, including defense stocks and traditional political corruption
- **Campaign Dominance:** Massive independent expenditure support for treaty supporters; equivalent opposition funding for defectors (no coordination)
- **Electoral Insurance:** The 3.5% public mandate makes supporting the treaty the politically safer choice
- **Political Insurance:** A new, highly popular policy platform that lets politicians claim credit for curing diseases and extending lifespans

#### What They Get:

- **A Personal Political War Chest:** We hand them an undeniable, popular mandate from the Global Referendum. They can use this massive wave of public support, which we built for them, to crush their political opponents, consolidate power, and build a legacy. We are giving them the ultimate political weapon.
- **The Power to Reward Allies:** Signatory leaders gain the right to direct a portion of the DIH's multi-billion-dollar R&D budget to universities and companies **in their home districts**. This is a firehose of cash they can use to create jobs, reward their biggest financial backers, and stand at ribbon-cutting ceremonies for decades.
- **Enriched Elites:** We will offer privileged, early access to VICTORY Bonds to a nation's sovereign wealth funds and key financial institutions _contingent on their leader signing the treaty_. This creates a powerful domestic coalition of the nation's wealthiest and most influential players who will pressure their leader to sign the deal that makes them rich.

**The Result:** The choice for a leader is simple: accept a political and financial package that guarantees their personal power and enriches their allies, or be swept away by the tide. Compliance becomes the only rational choice.

## The Plan

Here's how we do it:

1.  **Months 0-3:** Set up the legal structure and hire smart people to run the campaign.
2.  **Months 4-36:** Launch the global referendum to get 280 million people to vote, and raise **[$1.2–$2.5 billion](../economics/fundraising-and-budget-plan.qmd)** from investors.
3.  **Years 3-5:** Use the mandate and money to get major countries to sign the treaty, then start spending $27 billion per year on curing diseases.

That's it.

## Appendix: Referendums vs. Independent Expenditures

- **Referendums (where binding and timely):** Highest legitimacy; durable mandate; use when national or state mechanisms exist and timelines are practical.
- **Advisory signals (where no referendum):** Run scientifically credible polling or representative citizen assemblies; publish verified tallies per district.
- **Independent expenditures:** Fastest lever to translate district will into votes; pledge support for lawmakers who vote with their district's verified result (and oppose those who defy it), with strict no‑coordination.
- **Hybrid playbook:** Use the global referendum for umbrella mandate; use country/district signals to direct lawful independent expenditures.
