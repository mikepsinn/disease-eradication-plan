Our strategy isn't to convince anyone of anything.
It's to make everyone richer.

## The 3-Step Murder of the Status Quo

**Step 1: MONEY (Get \$1 Billion)**

Sell VICTORY Bonds to rich people who want to get richer.
Promise 270% returns (we can deliver because bondholders get 10% of the \$27B/year from military budgets).
Use the money for legal bribes (lobbying), building the tech, and running the global referendum campaign.

**Step 2: MANDATE (Get 280 Million Humans)**

Use the bond money to run a massive campaign.
Get 3.5% of humanity to click "yes" on not dying.
That's 280 million people.
Sounds impossible?
Wrong.
Civil rights did it.
Women's suffrage did it.
Gandhi did it.
And they didn't have the internet or the ability to promise people free healthcare.

**The 3.5% Rule:** Once 3.5% of any population actively supports something, politicians fold like wet paper.
It's not a theory, it's historical fact.
[No movement with 3.5% active support has ever failed](references.qmd#3-5-rule).
Ever.

**Step 3: TREATY (Turn Votes Into Law)**

Deploy the billion dollars in lobbying.
When 280 million voters want something AND you're spending more than defense contractors, politicians suddenly discover they've always cared about curing cancer.

Result: \$27B/year automatically flows from military budgets to medical research.
Forever.

## The Tech That Makes It Work

- **Blockchain:** So nobody can fake the votes or steal the money
- **Smart Contracts:** Money flows automatically, no middlemen
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:** Your medical data stays private while trials stay transparent
- **AI Matching:** Finds the right trial for you in seconds, not months
- **Open Source Everything:** No black boxes, no bullshit, no gatekeepers

This isn't idealism.
It's math.
And the math says we win.

## How Politics Actually Works

Politicians don't do things because they're moral.
They do things because they get paid.
Here's what we know about how this works:

- **People are greedy.** Politicians, corporate leaders, and voters choose whatever makes them richer or more powerful. Our strategy relies on this, not on people being good.

- **Small groups beat big groups.** A small group getting a lot of money will always fight harder than a big group losing a little money. We give the small groups massive benefits for supporting the treaty.

- **Politics is shopping.** Policy isn't decided by who has the best moral argument. It's decided by who offers the best deal. We're offering a better deal.

- **Everyone wants a cut.** Lobbyists and corporations will always try to grab money through politics. Instead of fighting this, we redirect it. We've created a new, more profitable way for them to get rich: the Peace Dividend.

Don't hope people change.
Give them better incentives.
