```{python}
#| echo: false
import sys
import os

# Quarto executes from project root (execute-dir: project in _quarto.yml)
appendix_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'brain', 'book', 'appendix')
if appendix_path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, appendix_path)

from economic_parameters import *
```

The legal setup is just as important as the money.
The structure must follow international law, securities regulations, and political rules without breaking anything.

The design is **bulletproof and legal.**

## 1. How to Split Up the Legal Stuff

Don't put everything in one company.
Split it across multiple countries to follow each country's laws properly.

- **🇨🇭 Swiss Foundation:** The main organization.
Switzerland is neutral, crypto-friendly, and good at international law.
This handles the main \`{python} format_billions(CAPTURED_DIVIDEND)` treasury.
- **🇺🇸 US Super PAC:** Completely separate entity that only Americans can fund, designed to influence US elections legally.
Zero coordination with the international stuff.
- **🇸🇬 Singapore Entity:** Handles crypto and treasury management in a place with clear crypto rules.
- **🇪🇪 Estonian Entity:** Builds the technology platform.
Estonia is [best in the world at digital governance](./references.qmd#estonia-eresidency-stats).

This splits up the legal risk and lets us optimize for each country's rules while keeping the core mission protected.

## 2. How to Follow Securities Laws

**[VICTORY Bonds](./economics.qmd)** and tokens need to follow securities laws everywhere.
The design is compliant from day one.

- **Rich People First:** Start by raising money from accredited investors using standard private placement rules.
This provides a solid financial base.
- **Tokens for Everyone Else:** Regular people earn utility tokens for actions like voting.
These start as utility points, not investments.
They only become valuable after the treaty passes and the system works, which [avoids securities law problems](./references.qmd#howey-test-securities).
- **No Bullshit Marketing:** Focus on what the project actually does, not get-rich-quick promises.
Be clear about risks.

## Appendix: Legal Compliance Details (Jurisdiction-Specific)

- **United States:** Use independent‑expenditure committees (Super PACs).
No coordination with campaigns; comply with FEC reporting and disclaimer rules; respect the foreign‑national ban (funds and decision‑making must be from U.S. persons for U.S. elections) [FEC guidance](./references.qmd#fec-foreign-nationals).
- **EU/UK/Canada/Japan and others:** Use lawful local equivalents (third‑party campaigners, [non‑party campaigners](./references.qmd#uk-electoral-spending-limits), PACs). Separate, jurisdiction‑specific entities; local counsel review; segregated banking and governance.
- **No quid‑pro‑quo contracts:** No smart‑contract triggers tied to legislative votes.
Rewards are independent expenditures based on public, verified district will.
