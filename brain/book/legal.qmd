The legal setup is just as important as the money. The structure must follow international law, securities regulations, and political rules without breaking anything.

The design is **bulletproof and legal.**

## 1. How to Split Up the Legal Stuff

Don't put everything in one company. Split it across multiple countries to follow each country's laws properly.

- **🇨🇭 Swiss Foundation:** The main organization. Switzerland is neutral, crypto-friendly, and good at international law. This handles the main $27 billion treasury.
- **🇺🇸 US Super PAC:** Completely separate entity that only Americans can fund, designed to influence US elections legally. Zero coordination with the international stuff.
- **🇸🇬 Singapore Entity:** Handles crypto and treasury management in a place with clear crypto rules.
- **🇪🇪 Estonian Entity:** Builds the technology platform. Estonia is best in the world at digital governance.

This splits up the legal risk and lets us optimize for each country's rules while keeping the core mission protected.

## 2. How to Follow Securities Laws

**[VICTORY Bonds](./economics.qmd)** and tokens need to follow securities laws everywhere. The design is compliant from day one.

- **Rich People First:** Start by raising money from accredited investors using standard private placement rules. This provides a solid financial base.
- **Tokens for Everyone Else:** Regular people earn utility tokens for actions like voting. These start as utility points, not investments. They only become valuable after the treaty passes and the system works, which avoids securities law problems.
- **No Bullshit Marketing:** Focus on what the project actually does, not get-rich-quick promises. Be clear about risks.

## Appendix: Legal Compliance Details (Jurisdiction-Specific)

- **United States:** Use independent‑expenditure committees (Super PACs). No coordination with campaigns; comply with FEC reporting and disclaimer rules; respect the foreign‑national ban (funds and decision‑making must be from U.S. persons for U.S. elections) [FEC guidance](./references.qmd#fec-foreign-nationals).
- **EU/UK/Canada/Japan and others:** Use lawful local equivalents (third‑party campaigners, non‑party campaigners, PACs). Separate, jurisdiction‑specific entities; local counsel review; segregated banking and governance.
- **No quid‑pro‑quo contracts:** No smart‑contract triggers tied to legislative votes. Rewards are independent expenditures based on public, verified district will.
