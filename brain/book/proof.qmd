from economic_parameters import *
```

This isn't a theoretical plan. It's a greatest hits album of things that have already worked. We're not inventing anything new; we're just combining proven models for science, economics, and politics into a single, unstoppable machine.

Here are the receipts.

## Oxford RECOVERY: The `{python} TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_FACTOR`x Proof

2020: British doctors cured COVID with a drug from 1961.
Cost: **[$500 per patient](references.qmd#recovery-cost-500)**.

American pharma companies testing the same drugs under FDA rules: **[$41,000 per patient](references.qmd#trial-cost-41k)**.

Oxford saved a million lives in [100 days](references.qmd#recovery-trial-100-days-to-cure).
Pharma saved zero lives in 10 years.

That's not a 10% improvement.
That's **[82 times better](references.qmd#recovery-trial-`{python} TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_FACTOR`x-cost-reduction)**.
The model exists.
It's been proven.
Now we scale it.

## Switzerland: The 200-Year Peace Dividend

Two world wars.
Everyone else fought.
Switzerland made chocolate.

**Result:**

- [25% richer than Americans ($93K vs $76K GDP per capita)](references.qmd#swiss-vs-us-gdp-per-capita)
- Live [5 years longer (84 vs 79 years)](references.qmd#swiss-vs-us-life-expectancy)
- Haven't had a [war death since 1847](references.qmd#switzerland-last-war-death-1847)
- Military budget: [0.7% GDP](references.qmd#swiss-military-budget-0-7-pct-gdp) (ours: [3.5%](references.qmd#us-military-budget-3-5-pct-gdp))

The difference went to education, healthcare, and trains that actually work.
Peace dividends compound over centuries.
War debts compound faster.

## War Bonds: How Capitalism Beat Fascism

WWII cost [$4 trillion (today's dollars)](references.qmd#wwii-cost-4-trillion-today).
America was broke.

**Solution:** Sell bonds to regular people.
Promise them profit + dead Nazis.

**Result:** [Funded the entire war](references.qmd#wwii-war-bonds), defeated fascism, everyone made money.

**The lesson:** When saving the world is profitable, people fund it.

[VICTORY Bonds](./economics/victory-bonds.qmd) use the same model.
Except instead of dead Nazis, we offer dead cancer cells.

## The Landmine Treaty: Citizens Beat Armies

1992: Random people decided landmines were stupid.
1997: [160 countries banned them](references.qmd#icbl-ottawa-treaty).

No government started it.
No UN committee.
Just pissed-off citizens with fax machines.

They beat the entire military-industrial complex in 5 years.
**With fax machines.**

We have the internet.

## The 3.5% Rule: It Never Loses

Harvard analyzed every major movement in history.

**Finding:** Once [3.5% of any population actively supports something, it wins](references.qmd#3-5-rule).
**Always.**

- Civil rights: Won at 3.5%
- Women's suffrage: Won at 3.5%
- Indian independence: Won at 3.5%
- Failed movements: Never hit 3.5%

The strategy needs 280 million people.
The internet reaches [5 billion](references.qmd#internet-users-5-billion).
Math says it wins.

## The Post-WW2 Economic Miracle: History's Greatest Peace Dividend

1945: US military spending [37% of GDP](references.qmd#us-post-wwii-military-spending-cut) (highest in history).
1948: Cut to [7% of GDP](references.qmd#us-post-wwii-military-spending-cut) (30 percentage points redirected).

**Result:** The greatest economic boom in human history.

- GDP growth: **[8% average](references.qmd#us-post-wwii-gdp-growth-8-pct)** for a decade (vs 2-3% normal)
- Middle class explosion: [Home ownership doubled](references.qmd#us-post-wwii-home-ownership-doubled)
- Education boom: GI Bill created modern knowledge economy
- Infrastructure: Interstate highway system built

**The lesson:** Redirecting military spending to productive uses = prosperity explosion.

## We Have Advantages They Didn't

- **Internet:** Instant global coordination
- **Money:** Subsidized healthcare creates participation incentive
- **Data:** We can prove what works in real-time
- **Urgency:** [150,000 people die daily](references.qmd#who-daily-deaths) (motivation is high)

## 2. The Political Precedents: How to Win

### A. Creating Binding International Law

**The Precedent: The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL)**

The idea that a citizen-led movement can create a binding international military treaty is not theoretical.
It has already been done.

- The ICBL was a global coalition of non-governmental organizations that successfully campaigned for the 1997 Ottawa Treaty, which banned the use of anti-personnel landmines and has been signed by over 160 nations.

**The Lesson:** The ICBL is the definitive proof that a decentralized, global, citizen-led movement can create binding international law, even against the initial opposition of major military powers.
Our **[Global Referendum](./strategy-overview.qmd)** strategy is a direct application of this successful model.

### B. Achieving a Political Tipping Point

**The Precedent: The 3.5% Rule (Erica Chenoweth's Research)**

The target of mobilizing 3.5% of the global population is not an arbitrary number.
It is based on rigorous academic research into the history of social movements.

- Political scientist Erica Chenoweth's research at Harvard University analyzed hundreds of major non-violent campaigns over the last century. Her data found a clear tipping point: once a movement achieved the **active and sustained participation of 3.5% of the population, it never failed** to bring about major political change.

**The Lesson:** The strategy is engineered to achieve this specific, data-driven threshold.
By focusing efforts on reaching this proven tipping point, it's not just hoping for change; it's executing a clear, evidence-based plan to make it inevitable.

## 3. The Financial Precedents: How to Fund It

### A. Mobilizing Mass Public Capital

**The Precedent: WWII War Bonds**

The plan to raise billions of dollars from the public to fund a global cause is based on one of the most successful financial mobilizations in history.

- During World War II, the United States and its allies raised the equivalent of trillions of today's dollars by selling **War Bonds** directly to citizens. The campaign masterfully blended patriotism with financial self-interest (the bonds paid interest).

**The Lesson:** **[VICTORY Bonds](./economics.qmd)** apply the same proven model.
They provide a mechanism to mobilize massive private capital for a public "war" effort by aligning financial incentives with a powerful moral mission.

### B. Building a New Global Health Institution

**The Precedent: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria**

The idea of creating a new, multi-billion-dollar global health institution from scratch has been done before.

- The Global Fund was created in 2002 as a public-private partnership to pool and distribute billions of dollars to fight these three diseases, operating outside of traditional institutional channels. It has since saved an estimated [70 million lives](references.qmd#global-fund-50-million-lives-saved) (as of 2025).

**The Lesson:** This provides the precedent for the **[Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](solution/dih.qmd).**
It proves that the world is capable of creating new, large-scale, and more efficient financial institutions for global health when the existing systems are insufficient.

### C. Pricing the Political Risk

**The Precedent: Michael Milken's High-Yield Bonds & George Soros's Political Arbitrage**

The investment thesis for VICTORY Bonds, a high-risk, high-reward bet on a political outcome, is grounded in proven financial strategies.

- **Michael Milken** proved that to attract capital for high-risk ventures, you must offer a correspondingly high, contractually obligated return.
- **George Soros's** legendary bet against the British pound in 1992 is the ultimate example of privately financed political arbitrage, proving it's possible to deploy immense private capital to bet on a political outcome.

**The Lesson:** The financial model, which offers a **[$>`{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` targeted return](economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**, is a direct application of these principles.
It correctly prices the political risk to attract the sophisticated capital needed to win.

## 4. The Cautionary Tales: How Not to Fail

The failures of past movements are even more instructive than the successes, as they reveal the exact failure modes our strategy is engineered to avoid.

### A. Don't Bring a Moral Argument to a Financial Fight

**The Precedent: The Nuclear Disarmament Movement ("The Freeze")**

- **The Failure:** Despite enormous popular support in the 1980s, the movement largely failed because it could not overcome the entrenched financial interests of the military-industrial complex.
- **The Lesson:** This is the historical proof for the core thesis: **You cannot defeat bad money with good intentions alone.** It is the primary justification for the strategy of **["legal bribery"](./strategy-overview.qmd)** and co-opting opposition with a superior financial offer.

### B. Don't Have a Diffuse, Unactionable Goal

**The Precedent: Occupy Wall Street**

- **The Failure:** While it successfully changed the public conversation in 2011, the movement produced no lasting policy change because it lacked a single, specific, actionable demand.
- **The Lesson:** The project avoids this trap by focusing all energy and capital on a single, clear, and achievable goal: **ratification of the "[1% Treaty](solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)."** That is the only ask.
