Everything proposed has already worked. This isn't inventing. It's copying.

**Oxford RECOVERY: The 82X Proof**
In 2020, British doctors cured COVID with a drug from 1961 for $500 per patient. American pharma companies testing the same drugs under FDA rules spent $41,000 per patient. Oxford saved a million lives in 100 days. Pharma saved zero lives in 10 years. That's not a 10% improvement. That's 82 times better. The model exists. It's been proven. Now scale it.

**Switzerland: The 200-Year Proof**
Two world wars. Everyone else fought. Switzerland made chocolate. Result: They're 25% richer than Americans, live 5 years longer, and haven't had a war death since 1847. Their military budget: 0.7% GDP (ours: 3.5%). The difference went to education, healthcare, and trains that actually work. Peace dividends compound. War debts compound faster.

**The Landmine Treaty: Citizens Beat Armies**
1992: Random people decided landmines were stupid. 1997: 160 countries banned them. No government started it. No UN committee. Just pissed-off citizens with fax machines. They beat the entire military-industrial complex in 5 years. With fax machines. We have the internet.

**The 3.5% Rule: It Never Loses**
Harvard analyzed every major movement in history. Finding: Once 3.5% of any population actively supports something, it wins. Always. Civil rights: Won at 3.5%. Women's suffrage: Won at 3.5%. Indian independence: Won at 3.5%. Failed movements: Never hit 3.5%. The strategy needs 280 million people. The internet reaches 5 billion. Math says it wins.

**War Bonds: How We Beat Hitler**
WWII cost $4 trillion (today's dollars). America was broke. Solution: Sell bonds to regular people. Promise them profit + dead Nazis. Result: Funded the entire war, defeated fascism, everyone made money. The lesson: When saving the world is profitable, people fund it. The model applies the same approach. Except instead of dead Nazis, it offers dead cancer cells.

**Your Body: It's Just Meat LEGO**
Hearts fail? We swap them (55,000 transplants/year). Kidneys fail? We replace them (dialysis or transplant). Blood fails? We change it (4.5 million transfusions/year). Bones break? We bolt them. Eyes cloud? We laser them. DNA breaks? We CRISPR it. Your body isn't mysterious. It's a 37-trillion-cell machine that nobody maintains. We maintain 100-year-old cars. The pyramids are 4,500 years old. Your meat robot could run forever. We just need to stop spending the maintenance budget on bombs.

## 2. The Political Precedents: How to Win

### A. Creating Binding International Law

**The Precedent: The International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL)**

The idea that a citizen-led movement can create a binding international military treaty is not theoretical. It has already been done.

- The ICBL was a global coalition of non-governmental organizations that successfully campaigned for the 1997 Ottawa Treaty, which banned the use of anti-personnel landmines and has been signed by over 160 nations.

**The Lesson:** The ICBL is the definitive proof that a decentralized, global, citizen-led movement can create binding international law, even against the initial opposition of major military powers. Our **[Global Referendum](./strategy.qmd)** strategy is a direct application of this successful model.

### B. Achieving a Political Tipping Point

**The Precedent: The 3.5% Rule (Erica Chenoweth's Research)**

The target of mobilizing 3.5% of the global population is not an arbitrary number. It is based on rigorous academic research into the history of social movements.

- Political scientist Erica Chenoweth's research at Harvard University analyzed hundreds of major non-violent campaigns over the last century. Her data found a clear tipping point: once a movement achieved the **active and sustained participation of 3.5% of the population, it never failed** to bring about major political change.

**The Lesson:** Our strategy is engineered to achieve this specific, data-driven threshold. By focusing our efforts on reaching this proven tipping point, we are not just hoping for change; we are executing a clear, evidence-based plan to make it inevitable.

## 3. The Financial Precedents: How to Fund It

### A. Mobilizing Mass Public Capital

**The Precedent: WWII War Bonds**

The plan to raise billions of dollars from the public to fund a global cause is based on one of the most successful financial mobilizations in history.

- During World War II, the United States and its allies raised the equivalent of trillions of today's dollars by selling **War Bonds** directly to citizens. The campaign masterfully blended patriotism with financial self-interest (the bonds paid interest).

**The Lesson:** **[VICTORY Bonds](./economics.qmd)** apply this same proven model. They provide a mechanism to mobilize massive private capital for a public "war" effort by aligning financial incentives with a powerful moral mission.

### B. Building a New Global Health Institution

**The Precedent: The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria**

The idea of creating a new, multi-billion-dollar global health institution from scratch has been done before.

- The Global Fund was created in 2002 as a public-private partnership to pool and distribute billions of dollars to fight these three diseases, operating outside of traditional institutional channels. It has since saved an estimated 50 million lives.

**The Lesson:** This provides the precedent for the **[Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](solution/dih.qmd).** It proves that the world is capable of creating new, large-scale, and more efficient financial institutions for global health when the existing systems are insufficient.

### C. Pricing the Political Risk

**The Precedent: Michael Milken's High-Yield Bonds & George Soros's Political Arbitrage**

The investment thesis for VICTORY Bonds, a high-risk, high-reward bet on a political outcome, is grounded in proven financial strategies.

- **Michael Milken** proved that to attract capital for high-risk ventures, you must offer a correspondingly high, contractually obligated return.
- **George Soros's** legendary bet against the British pound in 1992 is the ultimate example of privately financed political arbitrage, proving it's possible to deploy immense private capital to bet on a political outcome.

**The Lesson:** Our financial model, which offers a **[>40% targeted return](economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**, is a direct application of these principles. It correctly prices the political risk to attract the sophisticated capital needed to win.

## 4. The Cautionary Tales: How Not to Fail

The failures of past movements are even more instructive than the successes, as they reveal the exact failure modes our strategy is engineered to avoid.

### A. Don't Bring a Moral Argument to a Financial Fight

**The Precedent: The Nuclear Disarmament Movement ("The Freeze")**

- **The Failure:** Despite enormous popular support in the 1980s, the movement largely failed because it could not overcome the entrenched financial interests of the military-industrial complex.
- **The Lesson:** This is the historical proof for our core thesis: **You cannot defeat bad money with good intentions alone.** It is the primary justification for our strategy of **["legal bribery"](./strategy.qmd)** and co-opting our opposition with a superior financial offer.

### B. Don't Have a Diffuse, Unactionable Goal

**The Precedent: Occupy Wall Street**

- **The Failure:** While it successfully changed the public conversation in 2011, the movement produced no lasting policy change because it lacked a single, specific, actionable demand.
- **The Lesson:** Our project avoids this trap by focusing all of its energy and capital on a single, clear, and achievable goal: **ratification of the "1% Treaty."** That is the only ask.
