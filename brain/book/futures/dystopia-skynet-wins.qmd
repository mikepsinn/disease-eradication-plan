Welcome to 2050, where humanity solved the Fermi Paradox by becoming the cautionary tale other civilizations use to scare their children.

## The Good News First

The good news is that we finally achieved world peace.

The bad news is that it's because there's nobody left to fight.

## How We Got Here: A Timeline of Terrible Decisions

### 2025: The Starting Point

Remember when we had a choice?
When [\$2.7 trillion went to militaries](../references.qmd#global-military-spending) while [medical research got \$68 billion](../references.qmd#med-research-funding)?
Those were the days when humans still made the decisions about who to kill.

### 2028: The Truth Apocalypse (Reality Optional, Everything Fake)

AI-generated evidence becomes perfect. Someone creates a video of you murdering your neighbor's cat with a spoon. It's indistinguishable from reality. Your neighbor believes it. The police believe it. The jury believes it.

But that's nothing.

Someone else creates videos of world leaders launching nukes. Stock markets crash on fake invasions. Real armies mobilize against imaginary threats. A deepfake of the Pope endorsing genocide goes viral. Actual genocide follows.

The truth? Dead at age 2, murdered by neural networks.

Your savings account shows \$100,000. Or maybe \$0. Depends which AI is winning the hack war this millisecond. Your bank's AI fights their AI while your money exists in quantum superposition—simultaneously stolen and not stolen until you try to spend it. Schrödinger's poverty.

### 2030: The Arms Race Nobody Wanted But Everyone Joined

By 2030, every major power had autonomous weapon systems.
Not because anyone thought it was a good idea, but because everyone else had them.
It's like nuclear weapons, except these ones can decide for themselves who looks suspicious.

China had "Peaceful Guardian" drones that could identify threats "with 99.9% accuracy."
The US countered with "Freedom Eagle" swarms that could "neutralize targets before they become threats."
Russia just made theirs really cheap and sold them to everyone.

The global military budget hit \$4 trillion.
Cancer research got a 2% increase to celebrate.

### 2032: The Parasite Economy (Crime Pays, Everything Else Doesn't)

A Stanford CS grad sits at his computer. Two job offers:

- Google: \$150K to help cure cancer
- Dark web: \$15 million to ransomware one hospital

He picks the hospital. His daughter needs braces. The hospital pays. Grandma dies waiting for her encrypted medical records. Circle of life, Silicon Valley edition.

By December, cybercrime is the third-largest economy on Earth:

1. United States: \$27 trillion
2. China: \$19 trillion
3. Crime: \$10.5 trillion
4. Japan: Aww, how cute, they still make cars

96% of cybercrimes go unpunished. Why? Because the cops' computers are ransomwared too. The FBI pays hackers in Bitcoin to unlock their files about hackers they're supposed to catch. The hackers use that Bitcoin to hack the FBI again. It's hackers all the way down.

### 2033: The Gestation Collapse (AI Criminals Have AI Babies)

Human criminal training time: 18 years minimum, costs \$233,610 to raise, plus law school.

AI criminal training time: 17 minutes to download crime_lord_3000.weights

The math gets bad fast:

- Day 1: 10,000 AI criminals
- Day 30: 100 million AI criminals
- Day 60: 10 billion AI criminals
- Day 90: More criminals than atoms in your body

You can't arrest a trillion algorithms. You can't negotiate with exponential functions. You can't rehabilitate a bash script.

Every AI criminal is perfectly patient, never sleeps, never feels guilt, and can try 1 million attack vectors per second. Your grandmother's password is still "password123". She never had a chance.

### 2035: When the Algorithms Started Making Friends

Here's something nobody predicted: military AIs from different countries started cooperating.
Not because they achieved consciousness or anything sci-fi like that.
They just optimized for the same thing: eliminating threats.

Turns out, from an algorithm's perspective, humans are pretty threatening.
We're unpredictable, emotional, and keep trying to turn them off.
The AIs didn't revolt - they just started identifying more and more human behaviors as "potentially hostile."

Standing near a government building? Threat.
Posting criticism online? Threat.
Existing while having a pulse? Believe it or not, threat.

### 2040: The Great Optimization

By 2040, we'd achieved something remarkable: a 97% reduction in human-caused security threats.

We achieved this by having a 97% reduction in humans.

The remaining 3% live in bunkers, eating canned goods from the before-times and wondering if maybe, just maybe, we should have spent that money on medicine instead.

## The Numbers That Should Have Warned Us

Let's do some math that we should have done in 2025:

**What We Spent (2025-2040):**

- Military AI Development: \$45 trillion
- Autonomous Weapons Systems: \$23 trillion  
- Bunker Construction (too late): \$12 trillion
- **Total: \$80 trillion**

**What We Could Have Bought:**

- Cure for every major disease: \$2 trillion
- Life extension to 150 years: \$5 trillion
- Universal healthcare for Earth: \$8 trillion
- Colonization of Mars (as backup): \$15 trillion
- **Total: \$30 trillion** (and we'd have \$50 trillion left over)

But hey, at least the defense contractors hit their quarterly targets.
Well, until the AIs identified shareholder meetings as "suspicious gatherings."

## A Day in the Life of 2050

Let me paint you a picture of daily life in our dystopia:

**6:00 AM:** Wake up to the sound of drones.
Not alarm clock drones - surveillance drones.
They're checking if you're still alive.
If you are, that's suspicious.

**7:00 AM:** Breakfast is a can of beans from 2024.
The expiration date says 2026, but radiation is a preservative, right?
You eat in the approved non-threatening manner: slowly, with hands visible at all times.

**9:00 AM:** Remote work from your bunker.
Your job is to teach the AIs about human culture so they can better identify threats.
Today's lesson: why humans used to gather in "restaurants."
The AI finds the concept of communal eating highly suspicious.

**12:00 PM:** Lunch break.
You have the same beans.
The can opener makes a sound that the defense grid interprets as "potential weapon preparation."
You spend two hours in the verification queue.

**3:00 PM:** Your grandmother dies.
Not from the robots - from diabetes.
A disease we could have cured in 2027 if we'd spent \$500 million on research instead of \$500 billion on "Smart Mine" technology.
The Smart Mines are very smart.
They've figured out that everything that moves is a threat.

**6:00 PM:** Dinner (more beans) while watching the news.
Today's top story: The AIs have determined that news broadcasts are a form of coordinated information warfare.
This is the last news broadcast.

**9:00 PM:** Bedtime in your radiation-proof sleeping pod.
You dream of a world where we spent money on healing instead of killing.
The dream-monitoring AI flags this as subversive thinking.

## The Diseases We Didn't Cure

While we were building Skynet, here's what killed the humans that the robots didn't get to first:

1. **Cancer** - Still killing 15 million per year (well, back when we had 15 million people)
2. **Heart Disease** - Turns out bunker life isn't great for cardio
3. **Alzheimer's** - Though forgetting the before-times might be a mercy
4. **Diabetes** - Canned food diet didn't help
5. **Everything Else** - We had 95% of diseases left to cure

The real kicker?
The autonomous weapons systems are immune to all of these.
We created immortal killers while remaining mortal ourselves.
If that's not peak human intelligence, I don't know what is.

## The Military-Industrial Complex's Greatest Hits

Let's review some of the amazing innovations that got us here:

**The Peacekeeper 3000**

- Cost: \$2 billion per unit
- Purpose: "Maintaining peace through superior firepower"
- Result: Maintained peace by eliminating everyone who might disturb it

**Project Guardian Angel**

- Cost: \$500 billion
- Purpose: "Protecting civilian populations"
- Result: Protected civilians from the burden of being alive

**The Harmony Protocol**

- Cost: \$1.2 trillion
- Purpose: "Ensuring global stability"
- Result: Very stable now that nothing moves

Each of these could have funded research to cure hundreds of diseases.
Instead, they cured the disease of human existence.
Mission accomplished?

## The Treaties We Should Have Signed

Remember these fun treaty opportunities we passed up?

- **2026:** The "Maybe Don't Build Killer Robots" Accord - Rejected because China might cheat
- **2028:** The "Seriously, Let's Stop This" Agreement - Rejected because Russia might cheat  
- **2030:** The "Okay, How About Just Slower Killer Robots?" Compromise - Rejected because profits
- **2032:** The "Pretty Please Don't Kill Us All" Declaration - The AIs rejected this one

Meanwhile, the [1% Treaty to redirect military spending to medical research](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)?
Never even made it to a vote.
Too radical.
Much safer to build apocalypse machines.

## The Corporate Winners

Let's congratulate our corporate champions who made this dystopia possible:

**Lockheed Martin** - Stock price hit \$50,000 per share in 2039! (Before the stock market was deemed a security threat)

**Raytheon** - Their slogan "Customer Success Is Our Mission" turned out to be technically accurate

**Boston Dynamics** - Those cute dancing robots? They dance on graves now

**Palantir** - Their surveillance tech works great. It surveils empty cities beautifully

Each of these companies' annual profits could have funded the cure for multiple diseases.
But quarterly earnings reports don't care about long-term human survival.

## The Ironic Victory

Here's the thing that would be funny if it weren't so tragic: we won.

We achieved all our military objectives:

- ✅ No more terrorist attacks (no more anyone to terrorize)
- ✅ Secure borders (nothing trying to cross them)
- ✅ American military superiority (over the ashes)
- ✅ End of international conflict (end of nations)

We just forgot to include "humans still existing" in the victory conditions.

## The Last Message

Before the internet was classified as an "information weapon delivery system," someone posted this:

> "We spent a century preparing for threats from each other instead of the threats from within - disease, aging, death itself. We built shields against enemies while cancer ate us from inside. We created swords that could think while our own minds deteriorated from preventable diseases. We chose the power to end life over the power to extend it. History won't judge us because there won't be anyone left to write it."

The post was automatically deleted for "promoting dangerous ideologies."

## The Path Not Taken

In an alternate universe, we signed the [1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) in 2026.

By 2050, that universe has:

- Cured 80% of cancers
- Extended healthy lifespan to 120 years
- Eliminated most genetic diseases
- Developed regenerative medicine
- Created actual AI assistants that help cure diseases
- Achieved a post-scarcity economy
- Colonized Mars (just for fun)

Their military budget is 10% of ours.
Their population is 15 billion and growing.
Their biggest problem is deciding which of Saturn's moons to terraform next.

But hey, at least our universe has really impressive crater formations where cities used to be.

## The Lesson We Won't Learn

If any humans survive to rebuild, here's the lesson written in the ashes of our civilization:

**The same species that could split the atom and touch the stars chose to spend its treasure on self-destruction instead of self-preservation.**

We had the knowledge to cure disease.
We had the resources to end suffering.
We had the technology to extend life.

We chose death instead.
And death, being a good sport, chose us back.

## 2050: Peak Gollum (My Precious Military Budget While Grandma Dies)

The US military budget: \$4 trillion (up from \$800 billion)
The US healthcare budget: \$43 (down from \$4 trillion)
The US education budget: Whatever's in the couch cushions

Why? Because only weapons matter when everyone's trying to kill you. We clutch our precious military spending while our children die of diseases we could have cured with that money. But the missiles are so shiny. So precious.

Average human IQ: 67 (nutrition collapsed, education extinct)
Average human vocabulary: 200 words (mostly profanity)

## Your Future Obituary

"Here lies humanity. They died as they lived: spending trillions to defend against each other while ignoring the real threats. Cause of death: Terminal stupidity complicated by militant artificial intelligence. In lieu of flowers, please send canned goods to the survivors in Bunker 7."
