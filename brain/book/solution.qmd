The solution isn't complicated.
It doesn't require changing human nature.
It just requires changing what pays.

Here's the complete system that makes curing people more profitable than killing them:

## The 6-Step Process

**From \$27 Billion to Curing Cancer**

**1. Get the Money**: The **[1% Treaty](appendix/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** redirects \$27B/year from weapons to cures  
**2. Allocate Efficiently**: The **[DIH](./solution/dih.qmd)** uses democratic voting to fund what matters most  
**3. Pay Patients**: Subsidies go directly to patients who join trials  
**4. Run Cheap Trials**: Pragmatic trials cost [$500/patient](references.qmd#recovery-cost-500) instead of [$41,000](references.qmd#trial-cost-41k) (Oxford RECOVERY proved this works)  
**5. Publish Everything**: The **[dFDA](./solution/dfda.qmd)** shows real effectiveness data for every treatment  
**6. Label Outcomes**: Every food and drug gets honest labels about what it actually does  

**Result**: We know what works, what doesn't, and people get paid to help figure it out.

## The Proof: Oxford RECOVERY Trial Already Did This

Before you think this is theoretical, know that **Oxford already proved it works**:

- **Cost**: [$500 per patient](references.qmd#recovery-cost-500) (vs FDA's [$41,000](references.qmd#trial-cost-41k))
- **Speed**: [100 days to first cure](references.qmd#recovery-trial-100-days-to-cure) (vs FDA's [10 years](references.qmd#fda-approval-timeline-10-years))
- **Lives saved**: [1 million+ globally](references.qmd#recovery-trial-summary-quote)
- **Efficiency gain**: [82X cost reduction proven](references.qmd#recovery-trial-82x-cost-reduction)

The RECOVERY trial isn't a model - it's proof. We're just scaling what already succeeded. [See the full RECOVERY analysis →](appendix/recovery-trial.qmd)
