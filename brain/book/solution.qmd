# Quarto executes from project root (execute-dir: project in _book.yml)

Now that you understand the problem, which is that everyone is dying while we build missiles, it's time to learn how to fix it.

The solution has three parts:

1. The 1% Treaty (stealing money from the murder budget)
2. The Decentralized Institute of Health (spending it wisely)
3. The Decentralized FDA (making medicine 82 times cheaper)

Take money from death, give it to life. The tricky part is convincing humans, who historically prefer the death option.

## On the 1% Treaty

Here's how you redirect $27 billion per year from bombs to medicine:

You ask every nation on Earth to cut military spending by 1%. Just 1%. They keep the other 99% for wars and parades and whatever else militaries do when they're not accidentally losing trillions.

One percent is a rounding error. It's what the Pentagon loses between couch cushions.

Everyone cuts simultaneously. Nobody loses "relative power," which is the thing military people care about when they're not busy caring about flags and saluting.

I asked a general if losing 1% of weapons would weaken national security. He said yes. I asked if having 1% fewer weapons pointed at you by every enemy would make you safer. He stopped talking to me.

The math is simple: If everyone has 1% fewer weapons, the balance stays exactly the same, except now there are 1% fewer weapons total.

**On What You Buy With 1% Less War**

Twenty-seven billion dollars funds:

- 54,000 clinical trials at $500,000 each (the cheap way)
- Or 27 million patients in trials at $1,000 each
- Or 540 new drug approvals (current rate: 50 per year)
- Or curing 10-20 rare diseases completely in Year 1
- Or preventing 180,000 deaths annually

For comparison, $27 billion is:

- Less than the Pentagon's annual "we lost it" budget
- About what Americans spend on Valentine's Day
- Roughly what we spend on pet food every three months
- Apparently too much to ask for curing diseases

They say you can't put a price on human life. But apparently the price is somewhere south of pet food, which seems like it should be revised upward.

### On the Decentralized Institute of Health

Once you've got $27 billion per year to spend, you need somewhere to put it. This is where the DIH comes in.

The DIH is like the NIH, except it works. Here's how:

#### What the NIH does

- 200 people in a building decide what to fund
- They guess what might work
- They give grants to their friends
- Nothing gets cured
- Everyone gets tenure

#### What the DIH does

- Put the money in a treasury controlled by smart contracts
- Let 8 billion humans vote on budget allocation rules
- Subsidize patients in a marketplace of trials
- Patients choose which trials to join
- Trials that work get more patients and more funding
- Things actually get cured

The difference is like asking 200 bureaucrats what you should have for lunch versus asking your stomach. Your stomach knows things bureaucrats don't.

##### On Wishocracy

Wishocracy is how you let 8 billion people control a budget without everyone killing each other in meetings.

Here's how it works:

1. Anyone can propose how to spend the money (yes, even you)
2. The app shows you random pairs of proposals
3. You swipe left or right to allocate between them
4. "Sarah's cancer trial" versus "MIT's immortality pill"
5. Everyone's swipes get aggregated using math
6. The math reveals what humanity actually wants
7. Money flows automatically to top priorities

This is called "Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation," or APPA, which sounds complicated but is actually just "Tinder for budget priorities."

The important part is there's no committee. No gatekeepers. No humans with the power to say no. Just billions of micro-decisions that add up to what humanity actually wants, not what 200 people in suits think humanity wants.

###### On the Decentralized FDA

The FDA currently makes drugs 82 times more expensive than necessary. You're going to build a better one.

The Decentralized FDA (dFDA) does three things:

1. **Lets anyone run clinical trials** (no permission needed)
2. **Tracks what actually works** (real-world data, not guesses)
3. **Publishes outcome labels** (truth about every treatment)

Instead of waiting seventeen years for FDA approval while you die, you join a trial on the dFDA platform. The trial costs $500 per patient instead of $41,000 because it turns out you don't need seventeen layers of paperwork to figure out if aspirin works.

You report outcomes through your phone. The AI analyzes millions of data points. The platform publishes rankings: "For your condition, this works 73% of the time, this works 45%, this does nothing but costs less."

It's like Amazon reviews except for not dying, and Consumer Reports except the reports come from millions of actual sick people instead of three people in a lab coat.

###### On Outcome Labels

Right now, nutrition labels tell you what's in food. Warning labels tell you cigarettes kill you. Drug labels tell you to "ask your doctor," which is code for "we have no idea and neither do they."

Outcome labels tell you what actually happens:

**"This drug for your condition:"**
- Improves memory 35%
- Reduces symptoms 60%
- Causes headaches 9% of the time
- Costs $50/month
- Based on 50,000 real patients like you

It's just facts. No marketing. No lies. No 40-page legal documents written by lawyers having seizures.

Every food, every drug, every supplement: Outcome label. "Increases diabetes risk 12%." "Does nothing." "Actually works, surprisingly."

Finally, the truth about everything, generated by millions of humans testing things on themselves and reporting what happened.

###### On How Patients Pay Researchers

Here's where it gets weird in a good way:

Currently: Pharma companies pay $48,000 per trial patient  
New system: Patients pay researchers, subsidized by the DIH

The subsidy works like this: Available treaty funds divided by number of participating patients equals subsidy per person. More patients means lower subsidy per person, which prevents frivolous treatment seeking.

Researchers set their own price. Patients choose which trials to join. Money flows automatically. Successful trials attract more patients and more funding. Unsuccessful trials fade away.

Markets decide, not committees.

Sick people, guided by their doctors and data, choose what gets funded. Not bureaucrats. Not grant writers. Actual humans who need actual cures.

It's democracy for medical research, except instead of voting every four years for people who lie to you, you vote every day with your trial participation for treatments that might save your life.

###### On Why Defense Contractors Should Care

You'd think defense contractors would hate this. But here's what you tell them:

"You can keep 99% of your murder budget. But also, here are some bonds that pay 270% returns. Your pension fund would like those returns. Your shareholders would like those returns. You would personally like those returns because you also have a body that's falling apart.

Plus, killing people is getting bad PR. Curing cancer is excellent PR. Your ESG score goes up. Your stock price goes up. You still make weapons with the other 99%, you just also cure diseases with 1%.

It's called diversification. Ask your financial advisor."

Defense contractors are not evil. They're rational actors optimizing for profit within existing incentive structures. You're just offering them a better incentive structure that happens to save humanity as a side effect.

###### On Insurance Companies

Insurance companies have a simple preference: They want you either dead or immortal. Anything but expensively lingering.

Dead people file zero claims. Immortal healthy people file zero claims. Currently sick people cost billions.

The dFDA moves people from "currently sick" to either "dead" (whoops) or "cured" (success). Either way, the insurance company pays less.

Insurance companies have been trying to achieve this for fifty years but couldn't because the FDA makes cures impossible.

Show them the math: Every cure prevents decades of treatment costs. Every prevention program avoids future claims. Every patient in a trial is a patient not in an emergency room.

They'll buy VICTORY bonds because healthy people are profitable people, and profitable people make insurance executives happy, and happy insurance executives buy bonds that make them richer.

It's a virtuous cycle, which is Latin for "everyone wins by not dying."

###### On the War on Disease

You're declaring war on disease. But unlike previous wars on abstract concepts (drugs, terror, poverty, Christmas), this one will actually work.

Why? Because you're using markets instead of bureaucracy.

#### Previous Wars on Things

- Declare war
- Build bureaucracy to fight war
- Bureaucracy needs the problem to exist to justify its existence
- Problem gets worse
- Bureaucracy gets bigger
- Everyone loses except the bureaucracy

#### This War

- Declare war
- Create market that profits from solving problem
- Problem gets solved
- Market grows by solving more problems
- Everyone wins including the market

The difference is like asking a firefighter to prevent fires versus asking a fire extinguisher company to prevent fires. The firefighter needs fires to keep his job. The company needs fire prevention to sell extinguishers. Incentives matter.

##### On Aligning Everyone's Greed

The solution only works if everyone wins by winning. Here's who gets what:

**Defense contractors:** Keep 99% of budget + 270% returns on bonds  
**Pharmaceutical companies:** Patients pay them instead of vice versa  
**Politicians:** Campaign donations + not losing elections  
**Insurance companies:** Fewer claims = more profit  
**Billionaires:** 270% returns + legacy + naming rights  
**Regular people:** Subsidized treatment + direct democracy + not dying

Notice that everyone's selfish reason for participating happens to save humanity. Trick people into doing good by making good profitable.

The system doesn't require anyone to stop being selfish. It just redirects selfishness toward curing diseases instead of building bombs. It's like installing a fire alarm that also makes coffee, you're going to use it even if you don't care about fire safety.

###### On Why This Isn't Clinically Insane


History shows this works:
- Post-WWII: Cut military 30%, greatest boom ever
- Post-Cold War: Cut military 3%, 1990s prosperity
- Switzerland: 0.7% defense budget, richest country in Europe

You're only asking for 1%. Even drunk people can do 1%.

###### On the Meta-Solution

This solution isn't just about ending disease. It proves markets work better than bureaucracy for literally everything.

If you can cure diseases by redirecting 1% of military spending through market mechanisms, you can solve:
- Education (same structure, different market)
- Housing (same structure, different market)  
- Climate change (same structure, different market)
- Literally any public goods problem (same structure, different market)

This is the template for replacing government with systems that actually work. Not anarcho-capitalism or libertarian fantasy. Just pragmatic recognition that markets coordinate better than committees when you design them right.

The War on Disease is proof of concept. Victory here means you can fix everything else using the same playbook.

They say if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. But sometimes things are exactly as good as they seem, and the only reason nobody did them before is because nobody thought to try.


###### On What Comes Next

The rest of Part II explains each component in detail:

- How to structure the 1% Treaty so countries actually sign it
- How to build the DIH so it can't be corrupted
- How Wishocracy prevents lobbyists from stealing all the money
- How the dFDA achieves 82X cost reduction
- How everyone makes money
- How to make selfishness save humanity

That's it. That's the plan.

If that seems anticlimactic, remember: Every revolution starts with someone doing something slightly less stupid than what everyone else is doing.

In this case, the slightly less stupid thing is redirecting 1% of the murder budget to the not-dying budget.

History will judge whether this was genius or obvious. But either way, you'll be alive to see it, which is more than you can say for the alternative.
