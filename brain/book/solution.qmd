The solution isn't complicated.
It doesn't require changing human nature.
It just requires changing what pays.

Here's the complete system that makes curing people more profitable than killing them:

## The 6-Step Process

**From \$27 Billion to Curing Cancer**

**1. Get the Money**: The **[1% Treaty](./solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** redirects \$27B/year from weapons to cures  
**2. Allocate Efficiently**: The **[DIH](./solution/dih.qmd)** uses democratic voting to fund what matters most  
**3. Pay Patients**: Subsidies go directly to patients who join trials  
**4. Run Cheap Trials**: Pragmatic trials cost \$500/patient instead of \$41,000  
**5. Publish Everything**: The **[dFDA](./solution/dfda.qmd)** shows real effectiveness data for every treatment  
**6. Label Outcomes**: Every food and drug gets honest labels about what it actually does  

**Result**: We know what works, what doesn't, and people get paid to help figure it out.
