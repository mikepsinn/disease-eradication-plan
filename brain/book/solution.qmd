After reading the last section, you might be tempted to drink heavily. Don't. The solution is beautifully simple. It doesn't require virtuous politicians, brilliant leaders, or a fundamental change in human nature.

It just requires changing what pays.

We're going to hijack the machinery of greed and point it at the things that are trying to kill you. Here's how you build a system that makes curing people more profitable than killing them.

## The 6-Step Plan to Hijack a Broken System

<!-- TODO: STRUCTURE (CONTRADICTION) - The `TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING` variable (likely $24.4B, based on the '1% Treaty' chapter's 'Two-Tier Peace Dividend' section) contradicts the $27B figure used for the DIH budget in the 'DIH' and 'Investment Vehicle' chapters. Using different figures for the core funding amount is confusing and undermines credibility. Recommend using the simpler $27B figure consistently across all chapters. -->

**1. Get the Money**: The **[1% Treaty](appendix/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** redirects `{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)`/year from weapons to cures  
**2. Allocate Efficiently**: The **[DIH](./solution/dih.qmd)** uses democratic voting to fund what matters most  
**3. Pay Patients**: Subsidies go directly to patients who join trials  
**4. Run Cheap Trials**: Pragmatic trials cost [$500/patient](references.qmd#recovery-cost-500) instead of [$41,000](references.qmd#trial-cost-41k) (Oxford RECOVERY proved this works)  
**5. Publish Everything**: The **[dFDA](./solution/dfda.qmd)** shows real effectiveness data for every treatment  
**6. Label Outcomes**: Every food and drug gets honest labels about what it actually does  

**Result**: We know what works, what doesn't, and people get paid to help figure it out.

## The Proof: Oxford RECOVERY Trial Already Did This

Before you think this is theoretical, know that **Oxford already proved it works**:

- **Cost**: [$500 per patient](references.qmd#recovery-cost-500) (vs FDA's [$41,000](references.qmd#trial-cost-41k))
- **Speed**: [100 days to first cure](references.qmd#recovery-trial-100-days-to-cure) (vs FDA's [10 years](references.qmd#fda-approval-timeline-10-years))
- **Lives saved**: [1 million+ globally](references.qmd#recovery-trial-summary-quote)
- **Efficiency gain**: [`{python} TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_FACTOR`x cost reduction proven](references.qmd#recovery-trial-`{python} TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_FACTOR`x-cost-reduction)

The RECOVERY trial isn't a model - it's proof. We're just scaling what already succeeded. [See the full RECOVERY analysis →](appendix/recovery-trial.qmd)

Now, let's get into the details. Here's the blueprint for hijacking the planet's budget and pointing it at the right enemy.
