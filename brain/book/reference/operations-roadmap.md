# Operations & Roadmap

We're not building a normal company. We're building a small team to get this started, then making ourselves obsolete. Here's exactly how we do it.

---

## Operational Philosophy: Start Small, Then Disappear

### The Plan

We'll hire a few very smart people to build the system, then get out of the way.

Here's how we split the work:

- **Core Team:** A few people handle strategy, politics, legal stuff, and the big picture
- **Everything Else:** We hire contractors, agencies, and eventually pay the community to do the actual work

**We win when the system works without us.**

### How We Pay People

We pay modest salaries plus a big stake in the outcome.

- **Salaries:** Enough to live on, but not crazy money
- **Equity:** Big grants of VICTORY instruments that pay off when we win

This way, the team gets rich when the mission succeeds, not when they negotiate better salaries.

## Strategic Roadmap: Timeline to Global Impact

Here's how we go from a plan to a $27 billion annual budget in 3-5 years.

### Phase 0: Pre-Seed & Foundation (Months 0-3)

**Goal:** Establish core legal and financial structure and hire the "activation team" required to execute the main capital raise and global campaign.

**Operations:**
- **Fundraising:** Raise a $1M-$3M pre-seed round to fund salaries and initial operations
- **Legal:** Incorporate the initial for-profit management company and non-profit foundation
- **Team:** Recruit the three core leads for the activation team:
  - Capital Markets Lead
  - Elections & IE Compliance Lead
  - Growth & Referrals Lead

**The First Three People:**
- **Money Person:** Structure the VICTORY bonds, build the financial models, and raise money from investors
- **Legal/Political Person:** Design the legal framework for the global referendum and figure out how to run political campaigns in different countries without going to prison
- **Growth Person:** Build the platform where people vote and get rewards, and make it spread like wildfire

### Phase 1: Seed Round & Infrastructure (Months 4-12)

**Goal:** With a core team and seed funding in place, build the full legal, financial, and technical infrastructure required for the global campaign in 5 pilot countries.

**Operations:**
- **Fundraising:** Secure a $250M - $400M seed round
- **Team Expansion:** Recruit foundational leadership (CEO, COO, CTO, General Counsel) and heads of Product, Design, and Political Strategy (Headcount: ~20)
- **Platform Development:** Build and deploy V1 of the global referendum platform, referral engine, and impact calculators
- **Legal & Financial:** Formalize treasury management, finalize tokenomics for VICTORY instruments, and draft model legislation for pilot countries

**Twenty People Phase:**
Get the standard startup leadership team: CEO, COO, CTO, lawyers, and heads of product, design, community, and politics.

**Unlock Gate:** Secure 50 million verified referendum participants.

### Phase 2: Series A & Political Mobilization (Months 13-24)

**Goal:** Expand political operations to all G7 nations, achieve the 3.5% global participation threshold, and secure the first binding national commitments.

**Operations:**
- **Fundraising:** Secure a $500M - $1B Series A round
- **Team Expansion:** Scale the team to support a full-scale political operation, including regional campaign directors and a Head of Security (Headcount: ~50-75)
- **Global Referendum:** Execute the campaign to secure 3.5% global participation (280M+ votes)
- **Political Action:** Begin the first major independent expenditure cycles in priority elections

**Fifty to Seventy-Five People Phase:**
Add security, data science, more engineers, and political operatives to run the global referendum and political campaigns.

**Unlock Gate:** Achieve the 3.5% participation threshold and/or secure the first national treaty commitment from a G7 nation.

### Phase 3: Growth Round & Treaty Ratification (Months 25-48)

**Goal:** Ensure treaty ratification in all major powers (US, EU, China), fully capitalize the DIH treasury, and begin delivering returns to investors.

**Operations:**
- **Fundraising:** Secure a $500M - $1.1B growth round
- **Team Expansion:** Transition to a "Protocol Team" focused on treasury management, compliance, and decentralized governance (Headcount: ~75-100)
- **Activate the DIH Treasury:** Begin receiving the $27B+ annual revenue stream from signatory nations
- **Deliver Investor Returns:** Repay VICTORY Bond holders with a superior return, fulfilling the core financial promise

**Seventy-Five to One Hundred People Phase:**
Add CFO, compliance officers, and people who know how to run a massive budget without stealing. Manage the $27 billion treasury.

**Unlock Gate:** First treaty ratification by a major power.

### Phase 4: The Endgame (Years 4+)

**Goal:** With the 1% Treaty established, begin the multi-generational strategy to systematically phase out war by incrementally increasing the redirected percentage.

**Operations:**
- **Full Operational Deployment:** The DIH is a fully-funded, self-sustaining global institution
- **Fund Global Public Goods:** Deploy treasury funds to high-impact initiatives, with a primary focus on subsidizing patient participation in 80X more efficient decentralized clinical trials
- **Incremental Referendums:** After a successful proof-of-concept period, initiate global referendums for incremental increases to the redirection (e.g., to 1.5%, then 2%), creating a perpetual flywheel for peace and prosperity

The idea is to start small, scale fast when we need to, then stabilize once the money starts flowing.

## Key Gates & Success Metrics

- **Gate 1:** 100M referendum participants
- **Gate 2:** First $500M independent expenditure cycle
- **Gate 3:** First national treaty ratification
- **Gate 4:** First $1B disbursement from the DIH Treasury

**Summary Timeline:**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-12):** Build global referendum platform; secure initial $250M financing tranche; launch in 5 pilot countries
- **Phase 2 (Months 12-24):** Achieve 3.5% global participation; begin independent expenditures in priority elections; first binding referendum votes
- **Phase 3 (Months 24-36):** Secure first national treaty commitments; establish DIH treasury operations; begin giving money to universities and companies
- **Phase 4 (Months 36-48):** Scale to major powers (US, EU, China); achieve $27B+ annual inflows; full operational deployment
- **Phase 5 (Years 4+):** Begin the multi-generational endgame with incremental increases creating a perpetual flywheel for peace

## Risk Management & Mitigation

### Operational Risks

**Execution Risk:**
- **Mitigation:** Advisory board of constitutional scholars, DAO experts, and former officials; phased rollout with pilot countries
- **Approach:** Hire a few very smart people instead of building an enormous bureaucracy that would eat money like a hungry pig

**Timeline Risk:**
- **Mitigation:** Phased approach with clear gates; early wins in smaller countries build momentum for major powers

### Strategic Risks

**Cheating/Holdouts:**
- **Mitigation:** Start with coalitions of willing nations; use massive personal financial incentives targeting individual leaders in holdout nations - campaign support, personal investment opportunities in VICTORY bonds, and targeted independent expenditures against treaty opponents

**Capture/Corruption:**
- **Mitigation:** Transparent, algorithmic allocation based on verifiable health outcomes; independent audits funded by bounties

**Legal Challenges:**
- **Mitigation:** Multi-jurisdiction compliance from Day 1; constitutional scholars on advisory board; structured as treaty obligations, not domestic mandates

---

## Advanced Operations Framework

### Compensation Philosophy

- **Modest Base Salaries:** Enough to live on, but not crazy money
- **Significant Equity Stakes:** Big grants of VICTORY instruments that pay off when we win
- **Mission Alignment:** Team gets rich when the mission succeeds, not through salary negotiations

### Scaling Strategy

- **Start Small:** Core team of 3 people handling strategy, politics, legal, and big picture
- **Scale Strategically:** Hire contractors, agencies, and eventually pay the community for specific work
- **Make Ourselves Obsolete:** Build systems that work without central management

### Team Evolution

1. **Activation Team (0-3 months):** 3 core specialists
2. **Foundation Team (4-12 months):** 20 startup leadership roles
3. **Operational Team (13-24 months):** 50-75 political and technical operators
4. **Protocol Team (25+ months):** 75-100 treasury and governance specialists

The operational philosophy is simple: build a small, elite "activation team" whose goal is to create a self-sustaining protocol and then make themselves obsolete.
