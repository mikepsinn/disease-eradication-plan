Forget marches. Forget petitions. Forget changing your profile picture. We're not asking for your life. We're asking for 30 minutes.

Here are the three things you need to do. Once.

## Action 1: VOTE (2 Minutes)

This is the price of admission. The bare minimum. Go to the referendum site, prove you're a human, and vote YES on the 1% Treaty. Your vote is one drop in the 280-million-vote flood we need to build. It's not much, but it's not nothing.

## Action 2: INVEST (10 Minutes)

If you have the means, this is where you go from being a supporter to being an owner. An investment in **[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)** is not a donation. It's a high-risk, high-reward bet on the future of the human race with a projected `{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` annual return. This is the fuel. This is what buys the lobbyists, the ads, and the politicians. This is what wins the war.

## Action 3: RECRUIT (15 minutes)

This is how we win. Voting is a drop. Investing is fuel. Recruiting is how you build an army. Copy the message below and send it to ten people who are smart enough to get it.

> **Subject: The best investment in history**
>
> We spend 40x more on killing people than curing them. This is stupid.
>
> The 1% Treaty fixes this by redirecting 1% of military spending to a fund that will cure major diseases in a decade.
>
> It's funded by a bond that pays a `{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` annual return.
>
> Vote YES here: [link]
> Invest here (if you're rich): [link]
>
> This is not a charity. It's a hostile takeover of humanity's priorities. Join us.

## That's It.

Thirty minutes. That's your contribution.

Vote. Invest. Recruit.

Do it now. Because in the time it took you to read this chapter, another 100 people died from diseases we could have cured yesterday. Their deaths are on the system. Don't let yours be on you.
