title: ✊ The Three Actions
subtitle: Vote, Invest, Share - That's It
---

## That's All You Need To Do

Not 100 actions. Not a lifestyle change. Not a career pivot.

**Three things**:

1. Vote YES on the 1% Treaty
2. Buy VICTORY Bonds (if you can)
3. Share with 10 people

**Time required**: 30 minutes total
**Cost**: Optional ($1,000+ for bonds)
**Impact**: Could save millions

## Action #1: Vote YES

### How It Works

**The Global Referendum**:

- Online voting platform
- One vote per person (verified)
- Simple YES/NO question
- Results publicly visible

**The Question**:

> "Should nations redirect 1% of military spending to medical research through the 1% Treaty and DIH system?"
>
> [ ] YES
> [ ] NO

### How to Vote

**Step 1**: Go to [treaty.dih.org] (when live)

**Step 2**: Verify identity

- Email
- Phone number
- Government ID (for legitimacy)

**Step 3**: Click YES

**Step 4**: Done

**Time**: 2 minutes

### Why Your Vote Matters

**Historical precedent**: Every movement that gets 3.5% participation succeeds

- 280 million YES votes = Unstoppable political pressure
- Governments can't ignore 280 million people
- Politicians facing re-election will support it
- Treaty becomes inevitable

**Your one vote**: 1 / 280,000,000 of the threshold

**Your vote + sharing with 10**: Could generate 100+ votes

### What Happens After You Vote

1. **Counter updates**: Public dashboard shows vote count
2. **Pressure builds**: Politicians see the numbers
3. **Media coverage**: "100M people demand treaty"
4. **Tipping point**: At 280M, governments must respond
5. **Treaty signed**: Victory

## Action #2: Buy VICTORY Bonds

### What They Are

**Financial instrument** that funds the treaty campaign:

- You invest: $1,000 to $1,000,000+
- Funds go to: Lobbying, organizing, marketing
- You get: 10% of all treaty inflows, forever

### The Returns

**Conservative scenario** (we raise $3B total):

- Treaty passes → $27B/year to DIH
- Bondholders get 10% → $2.7B/year total
- Your $1,000 bond → $900/year forever
- **That's 90% annual return, permanently**

**Optimistic scenario** (we raise $1B total):

- Same $27B/year to DIH
- Bondholders get 10% → $2.7B/year total
- Your $1,000 bond → $2,700/year forever
- **That's 270% annual return, permanently**

### How to Buy

**Step 1**: Go to [bonds.dih.org] (when live)

**Step 2**: Connect wallet or bank account

**Step 3**: Choose amount

- Minimum: $1,000
- Maximum: No limit
- Recommendation: 1-5% of net worth

**Step 4**: Confirm purchase

**Step 5**: Receive bond NFT or certificate

**Time**: 10 minutes

### The Risk Analysis

**What if treaty fails?**

- Bonds convert to equity in DIH
- DIH still exists, still valuable
- Equity likely worth 50-100% of investment
- **Downside**: Limited

**What if treaty passes but takes longer?**

- Bonds still pay returns (from treaty funds)
- Just takes longer to reach full value
- **Downside**: Time delay

**What if full success?**

- 40-270% annual returns
- Forever
- Generational wealth
- **Upside**: Unlimited

**Expected value**: Massively positive

### Who Should Buy

**If you have $1,000+**:

- This is your best investment opportunity
- Better than stocks, real estate, crypto
- Diversification into impact investing
- Tax benefits (check local laws)

**If you have $10,000+**:

- Meaningful position
- Serious returns potential
- Portfolio transformation

**If you have $100,000+**:

- Life-changing returns
- Generational wealth potential
- Legacy impact

**If you have $0**:

- Skip this action
- Focus on voting and sharing
- Still crucial to success

## Action #3: Share With 10 People

### Why This Matters Most

**Math of exponential growth**:

- You share with 10 → 10 aware
- They share with 10 → 100 aware
- 6 degrees = 1,000,000 aware
- Everyone does this = Whole world aware

### Who to Share With

**High priority**:

1. **Parents** (they care about your health)
2. **Sick friends** (direct benefit)
3. **Wealthy friends** (bond opportunities)
4. **Social media followers** (amplification)
5. **Colleagues** (shared interests)

**Medium priority**:

6. **Extended family**
7. **Former classmates**
8. **Neighbors**
9. **Community groups**

**Low priority** (but still do it):

10. **Random internet strangers**

### How to Share

**Template message**:

> "We spend 40X more on killing than curing. The 1% Treaty fixes this.
>
> - Redirects 1% of military spending to hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials
> - Could cure major diseases in 10 years
> - You can vote YES: [link]
> - You can invest: [link]
>
> Takes 2 minutes. Could save millions of lives (including yours).
>
> Will you join me?"

**Platforms**:

- Text message (personal, effective)
- Email (detailed, trackable)
- Facebook post (broad reach)
- Twitter thread (viral potential)
- Instagram story (visual impact)
- LinkedIn (professional network)
- WhatsApp groups (direct communication)
- Reddit post (engaged communities)

**Time**: 15 minutes total

### The Gamification

**Track your impact**:

- Direct shares: 10
- Second-degree: 100 (they shared)
- Third-degree: 1,000 (compounding)
- Fourth-degree: 10,000
- Your total impact: 11,110 people aware

**Rewards** (if we implement):

- 10 shares → Badge
- 100 shares → Free bond lottery entry
- 1,000 shares → Guaranteed $1K bond
- 10,000 shares → VIP status, equity
- 100,000 shares → Named institute

## The 30-Minute Protocol

**Minute 0-2**: Vote YES

- Go to site
- Verify
- Click YES

**Minute 2-12**: Buy bonds (if able)

- Connect account
- Choose amount
- Confirm purchase

**Minute 12-30**: Share

- Copy template
- Send to 10 people across platforms
- Post publicly

**Done. You've done your part.**

## The Multiplier Effect

**If everyone does these three things**:

**Action 1** (Vote):

- 280M votes → Political inevitability

**Action 2** (Invest):

- $3B raised → Lobbying power → Treaty passes

**Action 3** (Share):

- 10 per person → Exponential awareness → Movement unstoppable

**Combined**: Victory in 2-3 years

## The Commitment

**Check the boxes**:

- [ ] I will vote YES on the 1% Treaty
- [ ] I will buy VICTORY Bonds (if I can afford it)
- [ ] I will share with at least 10 people
- [ ] I commit to doing this within 7 days

**Why 7 days?**

Because 3 people die per second.

That's 1,814,400 deaths in 7 days.

**Every day you delay, 259,200 people die.**

## What Happens If You Don't

**You don't vote**:

- One less vote toward 280M
- Slightly lower chance of treaty passing
- Multiplied by millions: Treaty might fail

**You don't invest**:

- Less lobbying money
- Slower movement growth
- Miss 40-270% returns

**You don't share**:

- 10 people stay unaware
- Those 10 don't share with 100
- Exponential growth breaks
- Movement slows

**You do nothing**:

- Current system continues
- 55 million die annually
- You die of preventable disease
- Your family suffers
- Humanity misses cure opportunity

## The Bottom Line

**Three actions. Thirty minutes. Could change everything.**

Vote. Invest. Share.

**Do it now. Because right now, someone just died who didn't have to.**
