## That's All You Need To Do

Not 100 actions. Not a lifestyle change. Not a career pivot.

**Three things**:

1.  Vote YES on the 1% Treaty
2.  Buy VICTORY Bonds (if you can)
3.  Share with 10 people (minimum)

**Time required**: 30 minutes total
**Cost**: Optional ($1,000+ for bonds)
**Impact**: Could save millions

## Action #1: Vote YES

### How It Works

**The Global Referendum**:

- Online voting platform
- One vote per person (verified)
- Simple YES/NO question
- Results publicly visible

**The Question**:

> "Should nations redirect 1% of military spending to medical research through the 1% Treaty and DIH system?"
>
> [ ] YES
> [ ] NO

### How to Vote

**Step 1**: Go to [treaty.dih.org] (when live)

**Step 2**: Verify identity

- Email
- Phone number
- Government ID (for legitimacy)

**Step 3**: Click YES

**Step 4**: Done

**Time**: 2 minutes

### Why Your Vote Matters

**Historical precedent**: Every movement that gets 3.5% participation succeeds.

- 280 million YES votes = Unstoppable political pressure
- Governments can't ignore 280 million people
- Politicians facing re-election will support it
- Treaty becomes inevitable

**Your one vote**: 1 / 280,000,000 of the threshold

**Your vote + sharing with 10**: Could generate 100+ votes

### What Happens After You Vote

1.  **Counter updates**: Public dashboard shows vote count
2.  **Pressure builds**: Politicians see the numbers
3.  **Media coverage**: "100M people demand treaty"
4.  **Tipping point**: At 280M, governments must respond
5.  **Treaty signed**: Victory

## Action #2: Buy VICTORY Bonds

### What They Are

**Financial instrument** that funds the treaty campaign:

- You invest: $1,000 to $1,000,000+
- Funds go to: Lobbying, organizing, marketing
- You get: 10% of all treaty inflows, forever

### The Returns

**The math**: At $1B raised and $27B annual treaty revenue, bondholders get **270% annual returns, perpetually**.

Your $1,000 bond → $2,700/year forever.

**Want the detailed scenarios?** See [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) for full investment terms, risk analysis, and projections.

### How to Buy

**Step 1**: Go to [bonds.dih.org] (when live)

**Step 2**: Connect wallet or bank account

**Step 3**: Choose amount

- Minimum: $1,000
- Maximum: No limit
- Recommendation: 1-5% of net worth

**Step 4**: Confirm purchase

**Step 5**: Receive bond NFT or certificate

**Time**: 10 minutes

### The Risk

**The truth**: This is high-risk political arbitrage. If the treaty fails, you lose your investment.

**The upside**: 270% annual returns forever if it works.

**The calculation**: Even with a small probability of success, the expected value is massively positive.

**Want the full risk analysis?** See [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) for detailed scenarios and risk breakdowns.

### Who Should Buy

**If you have $1,000+**:

- This is your best investment opportunity
- Better than stocks, real estate, crypto
- Diversification into impact investing
- Tax benefits (check local laws)

**If you have $10,000+**:

- Meaningful position
- Serious returns potential
- Portfolio transformation

**If you have $100,000+**:

- Life-changing returns
- Generational wealth potential
- Legacy impact

**If you have $0**:

- Skip this action
- Focus on voting and sharing
- Still crucial to success

## Action #3: Become an Infectious Agent of Common Sense

### Why This Matters Most

Voting and investing are quiet, personal acts. Sharing is how you build an army. This entire plan hinges on the terrifyingly simple math of exponential growth. It’s the same principle that makes pyramid schemes and pandemics work, except we're using it to stop people from dying for stupid reasons.

- You share with 10 people → 10 people now know.
- They get annoyed/inspired and share with 10 → 100 people know.
- After just six rounds of this, one million people have been exposed.

This is how you start a fire. We’ve broken it down into two levels: the bare minimum and the overachiever.

### The 15-Minute Minimum: Nudge 10 People

This is the baseline. It takes 15 minutes. No excuses.

**Who to Annoy First**:

1.  **Parents** (they are biologically programmed to care about you not dying)
2.  **Sick friends** (they have a slightly more vested interest than most)
3.  **Wealthy friends** (prime VICTORY Bond targets)
4.  **Social media followers** (free amplification)
5.  **Colleagues** (if you can stand them)
6.  **Extended family** (your weird uncle needs a project)
7.  **Former classmates**
8.  **Neighbors**
9.  **Community groups**
10. **Random internet strangers** (the last resort of the truly dedicated)

**How to Share (The Template That Actually Gets Read)**:

Copy this. Paste it. Send it. Don't overthink it.

> "We spend 40X more on killing than curing. The 1% Treaty fixes this.
>
> - Redirects 1% of military spending to hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials
> - Could cure major diseases in 10 years
> - You can vote YES: [link]
> - You can invest: [link]
>
> Takes 2 minutes. Could save millions of lives (including yours).
>
> Will you join me?"

Send it via text, email, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn—whatever gets the job done.

### The 5-Hour Deep Dive: For Overachievers and the Truly Fed-Up

So, 10 people is a nice start. It's cute. But let's be honest, you know more people than that.

The average human brain can keep track of about 150 meaningful relationships before it starts to short-circuit. This is called Dunbar's Number, and it's your new target list.

Here’s the soul-crushing math:

- **People you actually know:** 150
- **Time to send a personalized-ish message:** 2 minutes
- **Total time investment:** 150 x 2 = 300 minutes.

**That’s 5 hours.** Five hours of your life to personally contact every single person you care about and give them a chance to not die from something preventable. What’s the return on that investment? If just one of those 150 people is rich and bored enough to buy a significant VICTORY Bond, your five hours of work just generated a return that would make a hedge fund manager weep with envy.

You spend more time than that doomscrolling in a week.

### The Gamification (Because We're All Monkeys Who Like Points)

Let's make a game of it. Every person you tell is a point. Every person *they* tell is a point for you.

- **Track your impact**:
    -   Direct shares: 10 (or 150 if you’re not messing around)
    -   Second-degree: 100+ (they shared)
    -   Third-degree: 1,000+ (it's compounding)
    -   Your total impact: An avalanche of awareness you started with a single text.
- **Rewards**: Share to earn rewards and climb the leaderboard. See the [Global Referendum chapter](../strategy/global-referendum.qmd) for details.

## The 30-Minute Protocol

**Minute 0-2**: Vote YES

- Go to site
- Verify
- Click YES

**Minute 2-12**: Buy bonds (if able)

- Connect account
- Choose amount
- Confirm purchase

**Minute 12-30**: Share

- Copy template
- Send to 10 people across platforms
- Post publicly

**Done. You've done your part.** (The bare minimum part, at least.)

## The Multiplier Effect

**If everyone does these three things**:

**Action 1** (Vote):

- 280M votes → Political inevitability

**Action 2** (Invest):

- $1B raised → Lobbying power → Treaty passes

**Action 3** (Share):

- 10 per person → Exponential awareness → Movement unstoppable

**Combined**: Victory in 2-3 years

## The Commitment

**Check the boxes**:

- [ ] I will vote YES on the 1% Treaty
- [ ] I will buy VICTORY Bonds (if I can afford it)
- [ ] I will share with at least 10 people
- [ ] I commit to doing this within 7 days

**Why 7 days?**

Because nearly 2 people die every second from preventable disease.

That's over 1 million deaths in 7 days.

**Every day you delay, 150,000 people die.**

## What Happens If You Don't

**You don't vote**:

- One less vote toward 280M
- Slightly lower chance of treaty passing
- Multiplied by millions: Treaty might fail

**You don't invest**:
- Less lobbying money
- Slower movement growth
- Miss 270% potential returns

**You don't share**:

- 10 people stay unaware
- Those 10 don't share with 100
- Exponential growth breaks
- Movement slows

**You do nothing**:

- Current system continues
- 55 million die annually
- You die of preventable disease
- Your family suffers
- Humanity misses cure opportunity

## The Bottom Line

**Three actions. Thirty minutes. Could change everything.**

Vote. Invest. Share.

**Do it now. Because right now, someone just died who didn't have to.**
