|--------|------|-----------------|------------------|
| Vote YES | 2 minutes | Lives saved, cures | Nothing lost |
| Buy $1K bonds | $1,000 | $40K-270K/year | Equity in DIH |
| Share 10 people | 5 minutes | Movement success | Nothing lost |
| Do nothing | $0 | $0 | Die like today |

**Expected value of participation**: Astronomical
**Expected value of inaction**: Death

## The Bottom Line

This isn't charity. **This is the best deal anyone has ever offered you.**

- Small chance to invest: Massive returns

- Minutes to share: Save millions of lives

**Or**:

- Don't participate
- Keep the current system
- Die of preventable disease
- Miss out on 40-270% returns
- Watch your family suffer

**Your choice. But choose fast.**

**Because while you decide, 3 people just died.**
