## This Isn't About Altruism. This Is About You.

Forget saving humanity. Let's talk about what you, personally, get out of this. You don't need to be a good person to support this plan. You just need to be selfish.

**If you're sick, or will ever get sick:**
Instead of waiting 17 years for a cure that may never come, you get immediate access to subsidized clinical trials for every disease. Your chance of survival goes from near-zero to "actually possible."

**If you're healthy (for now):**
As diseases are cured, the entire cost of healthcare plummets. Your insurance premiums will drop by 50-70%, saving you over **$240,000** over your lifetime. That's a house.

**If you have money:**
[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) offer a projected **`{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` annual return**, perpetually. This returns 270% annually. I could not find a comparable investment. You can profit while funding the research that will make you immortal.

**If you have a family:**
Your parents won't die of Alzheimer's. Your children won't have to worry about rare diseases. You get to keep the people you love.

**The bottom line is this:**

-   **If you're young,** your life expectancy jumps from 80 to 150+.
-   **If you're old,** you get an extra 20-30 years of healthy life as we start to reverse aging itself.

This isn't a charity. It's a deal. You're being offered more money, more time, and the lives of your loved ones in exchange for supporting a 1% budget reallocation. It's the best deal anyone has ever offered you.

Your choice. But choose fast. While you were reading this, another person just died.
