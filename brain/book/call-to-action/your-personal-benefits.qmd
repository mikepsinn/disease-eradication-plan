Forget saving humanity. Let's talk about what you, personally, get out of this. You don't need to be a good person to support this plan. You just need to be selfish.

### Your Actual Odds Right Now

If you get sick (and you will), your chances of getting into a clinical trial are **0.2%** - that's 1 in 480 people with chronic disease.

[Half of humanity is willing to participate](../references.qmd#patient-willingness-clinical-trials), but the system can only handle [5 million people per year](../appendix/clinical-trial-participants.qmd). The other 99.8% get to die while waiting for approval.

### What You Actually Get

```{python}
#| label: personal-benefits-calc
#| echo: false

# Calculate for typical 30-year-old making $50K

calc = calculate_personal_lifetime_wealth_disease_eradication(
    treaty_pct=0.01,
    current_age=30,
    annual_income=50000,
    years_elapsed=20,  # 20-year scenario
    discount_rate=0.03
)

total_benefit = calc['total_lifetime_benefit']
life_extension = calc['life_extension_years']
```

**If you're sick, or will ever get sick:**

Instead of waiting 17 years for a cure that may never come, you get immediate access to subsidized clinical trials for every disease. Your chance of survival goes from near-zero to "actually possible."

## If you're healthy (for now)

As diseases are cured, healthcare costs plummet. The 1% Treaty accelerates research by 115x (2,300 research-years in 20 years). That means cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's - all tackled simultaneously by gene therapy, AI drug discovery, stem cells, and epigenetics.

### If you have money

[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) offer a projected **271.8% annual return**, perpetually. I could not find a comparable investment. You can profit while funding the research that will make you immortal.

#### If you have a family

Your parents won't die of Alzheimer's. Your children won't have to worry about rare diseases. You get to keep the people you love.

### The Math

Here's what a typical 30-year-old making $50,000/year actually gets:

{{< include ../../figures/disease-eradication-lifetime-wealth-component-breakdown-pie-chart.qmd >}}

```{python}
#| echo: false
from IPython.display import Markdown
Markdown(f"#### Total lifetime benefit: ${personal_lifetime_benefit_eradication_20yr_age_30_1pct_millions_formatted}M")
```

Where does this come from?

- **Extended Earnings** (30%): You live 72 extra years (age 80→152). That's 72 more years of earning, investing, and compounding.
- **Economic Multiplier** (58%): Redirecting military spending to research creates GDP growth (post-WW2: 30% military cut → 8% GDP growth). This compounds over your 122-year lifetime.
- **Healthcare Savings** (4%): Diseases get cured, your insurance premiums drop by ~$1,650/year.
- **Productivity Gains** (8%): You're healthier, you work better, you earn more.

{{< include ../../figures/disease-eradication-annual-benefits-stacked-area-chart.qmd >}}

**The red line at age 80 is everything.** Without the treaty, you're dead. With the treaty, you live another 72 years. Everything to the right of that line - roughly **60-70% of your total lifetime wealth** - only exists if this succeeds.

### Your Wealth Depends on Treaty Terms

{{< include ../../figures/disease-eradication-lifetime-wealth-by-treaty-percentage-line-chart.qmd >}}

The treaty percentage negotiated determines whether you get millions or generational wealth:

- **0.5% Treaty**: $3.6M lifetime benefit
- **1% Treaty** (DEFAULT): $4.3M lifetime benefit
- **5% Treaty**: $16M lifetime benefit

This is why the treaty terms matter. The difference between 1% and 5% is measured in tens of millions per person.

### The Bottom Line

- **If you're 30:** Life expectancy jumps from 80 to 152 (+72 years), $4.3M total benefit
- **If you're 25:** Life expectancy to 157 (+77 years), $5.0M total benefit
- **If you're 55:** Life expectancy to 147 (+67 years), $2.8M total benefit

This isn't a charity. It's a deal. You're being offered millions in lifetime wealth, 70+ extra years of life, and the survival of your loved ones in exchange for supporting a 1% budget reallocation.

It's the best deal anyone has ever offered you.

### What You're Actually Making Per Hour

You're not being asked to donate your time. You're being offered the highest-paying job in human history.

**Time Investment:**
- Reading this book: `{python} book_reading_time_hours_formatted` hours (`{python} f"{TOTAL_BOOK_WORDS:,}"` words at `{python} BOOK_READING_SPEED_WPM` words/minute)
- Taking actions: `{python} action_time_total_hours_formatted` hours ([Vote `{python} ACTION_TIME_VOTE_MINUTES` min + Invest `{python} ACTION_TIME_INVEST_MINUTES` min + Recruit `{python} ACTION_TIME_RECRUIT_MINUTES` min](../call-to-action/three-actions.qmd))
- **Total: `{python} total_time_investment_hours_formatted` hours**

**Effective Hourly Rate: `{python} effective_hourly_rate_thousands_formatted`/hour**

This is:
- **`{python} effective_hourly_rate_vs_wage_multiplier_formatted`x** the average US wage (~$`{python} AVERAGE_US_HOURLY_WAGE`/hour)
- **`{python} effective_hourly_rate_vs_ceo_multiplier_formatted`x** a CEO's hourly rate (~$`{python} f"{TYPICAL_CEO_HOURLY_RATE:,}"`/hour)

The catch? You only get paid if the plan works. But if it does, you just made `{python} effective_hourly_rate_thousands_formatted`/hour for `{python} total_time_investment_hours_formatted` hours of work.

**Your choice. But choose fast.** While you were reading this, another person just died.
