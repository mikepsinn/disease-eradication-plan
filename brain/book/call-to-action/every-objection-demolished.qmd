subtitle: The FAQ That Ends All Excuses
---

## "This Will Never Work"

**Objection**: "Nice idea, but it's too ambitious. It'll never actually happen."

**Response**: The Oxford RECOVERY trial already proved decentralized trials work. They:

- Tested 7 treatments in 6 months
- Saved 1 million lives
- Cost $500 per patient (vs FDA's $41,000)
- Used existing hospital systems

We're just scaling what already succeeded.

**Follow-up**: "But globally?"
**Response**: The internet scaled globally. Smartphones scaled globally. COVID vaccines scaled globally. Medical trials are easier than those.

## "We Need the Military Budget"

**Objection**: "We can't reduce military spending. That would make us vulnerable."

**Response**: We're taking 1%. You keep 99%.

- Current US military: $850B
- After 1% reduction: $841.5B
- Difference: $8.5B (one aircraft carrier every 2 years)
- Military advantage: Unchanged (everyone reduces equally)

**Follow-up**: "But what if enemies don't reduce?"
**Response**: That's literally the point of a treaty. Everyone signs simultaneously. Anyone who doesn't sign gets international pressure and looks like they want people to die.

## "Big Pharma Will Block This"

**Objection**: "Pharmaceutical companies will kill this. They profit from disease."

**Response**: Under DIH, pharma makes MORE money, not less.

**Current system**:

- Pharma pays $2.6B for trials
- 90% of drugs fail
- Only blockbusters are profitable
- Net: Often losses

**DIH system**:

- Patients pay pharma to run trials (via subsidy)
- Trials become revenue, not cost
- Every drug becomes profitable
- Net: Guaranteed profit

**Pharma will lobby FOR us, not against us.**

## "You Can't Trust 8 Billion People"

**Objection**: "Letting everyone decide is mob rule. We need experts."

**Response**: We trust 8 billion people to:

- Use the internet safely
- Drive cars
- Vote for people with nuclear codes
- Decide what to buy, eat, and do

But we can't trust them to click YES on "should we cure disease"?

**Follow-up**: "But they're not qualified!"
**Response**: Princeton proved experts (200-person NIH committee) haven't cured anything in 50 years. Maybe qualification isn't working.

## "What About National Sovereignty?"

**Objection**: "This forces countries to spend money a certain way. That violates sovereignty."

**Response**: No force involved. Countries voluntarily sign treaty.

- Don't want to sign? Don't sign.
- Citizens demand it? Then sign.
- That's how democracy works.

**Follow-up**: "What if our government doesn't want to?"
**Response**: Vote them out. That's also how democracy works.

## "This Is Socialism/Communism"

**Objection**: "Government controlling healthcare spending is socialist!"

**Response**:

1. We're not controlling healthcare. We're funding research.
2. Military spending is already "socialized" (government spending).
3. We're just moving 1% from one government program to another.
4. The dFDA is decentralized markets, not central planning.
5. VICTORY Bonds are pure capitalism (40-270% returns).

**This is the most capitalist medical system ever proposed.**

## "The FDA Exists for a Reason"

**Objection**: "We need FDA approval to ensure safety. You're being reckless."

**Response**: The FDA's caution kills more than it saves.

**FDA delays** (1962-present): 4-10 million American deaths from drug lag

**FDA-prevented disasters**: Maybe thalidomide (1,000 deaths prevented)

**Net**: FDA has killed 4,000-10,000 people for every person it saved.

**Under dFDA**: Patients see real data on risks/benefits and decide for themselves. Adults making informed choices about their own bodies.

## "What If Countries Cheat?"

**Objection**: "Countries will promise to reduce military spending but won't actually do it."

**Response**: Blockchain verification.

- Every contribution is public
- Smart contracts enforce allocation
- Anyone can audit in real-time
- Cheating is immediately visible

**Unlike traditional treaties** (based on trust), **this one is based on code**.

## "You're Being Too Negative About Research"

**Objection**: "The NIH does good work! You're being unfair."

**Response**: The NIH has:

- $48B annual budget
- 50 years of operation
- Thousands of researchers
- Zero diseases eradicated

**Meanwhile smallpox** was eradicated by:

- Global coordination
- Decentralized implementation
- Direct patient access
- 10-year timeline

**The NIH model doesn't work. The smallpox model does. We're using the one that works.**

## "This Is Too Good to Be True"

**Objection**: "40-270% returns? Curing disease? This sounds like a scam."

**Response**:

**The returns** are high because:

- We're capturing value from $109T disease burden
- 10% of $27B yearly inflows
- Divided among bondholders
- Math checks out

**The cures** are achievable because:

- Oxford proved the model works
- We're removing FDA bottleneck
- 82X cost reduction
- Timeline matches historical eradication efforts

**It sounds too good because we've been failing for so long, we forgot what success looks like.**

## "You Can't Cure Aging"

**Objection**: "Aging is natural and inevitable. You can't fight nature."

**Response**: We replace everything else that breaks.

- Hearts: We replace them (artificial hearts, transplants)
- Kidneys: We replace them (dialysis, transplants)
- Blood: We replace it (transfusions daily)
- Bones: We replace them (titanium upgrades)
- Joints: We replace them (hip replacements routine)

**Aging is just damage accumulation**:

- Telomeres shorten: We can lengthen them (telomerase activation)
- Cells senesce: We can clear them (senolytic drugs)
- Proteins misfold: We can refold them (molecular chaperones)
- Mitochondria fail: We can replace them (mitochondrial transfer)
- DNA breaks: We can repair it (CRISPR, base editing)

**We went to the moon with slide rules. We can fix cells with AI.**

Your body is a machine. Machines can be repaired. Aging is just harder engineering, not magic.

## "I'm Just One Person"

**Objection**: "My vote/investment/share won't matter. I'm too small."

**Response**:

**Every movement** started with individuals:

- Civil rights: Rosa Parks
- Women's suffrage: Individual women voting
- End of slavery: Started with individuals opposing it

**3.5% rule**: This needs 280 million people. You're 1/280,000,000 of that.

**But if you share with 10**, you're 1/28,000,000.
**If they share with 10**, you're 1/2,800,000.
**6 degrees**, you've reached millions.

**You're not too small. You're the beginning.**

## "The Government Will Steal the Money"

**Objection**: "You create a $27B fund, politicians will redirect it to their friends."

**Response**: They can't. Smart contracts.

**Traditional budget**:

- Congress allocates money
- Bureaucrats decide spending
- Lobbying influences decisions
- Money gets stolen

**DIH Treasury**:

- Smart contract holds money
- Wishocracy allocates spending
- Code executes automatically
- No human can redirect

**If politicians could steal it, we wouldn't be using this system.**

## "We Should Fix Current System, Not Replace It"

**Objection**: "Why not just reform the FDA and NIH?"

**Response**: People have been trying for 50 years.

- More funding? Tried. No diseases cured.
- Different leadership? Tried. Same results.
- New regulations? Tried. Slower approvals.
- Reform bills? Tried. Lobbyists kill them.

**The system can't be fixed because the system IS working - for the people in power.**

Defense contractors get $2.7T. NIH gets $48B for lifetime employment. Pharma gets patent protection.

**The system won't reform itself. Build around it instead.**

## "This Is Politically Impossible"

**Objection**: "No government will agree to this. It's fantasy."

**Response**:

**Governments agreed to**:

- Paris Climate Accord (harder ask, less benefit)
- Nuclear Non-Proliferation (much harder ask)
- International Space Station (cost more, helped less)

**This treaty is easier**:

- Smaller ask (1% vs 100%)
- Direct benefit (cures for voters)
- Economic positive (healthcare costs drop)
- Political win (look like heroes)

**Plus**: 280 million voters demanding it makes it politically impossible to refuse.

## "I Don't Trust Blockchain/Crypto"

**Objection**: "Blockchain is a scam. I don't want my money in crypto."

**Response**:

**Two things**:

1. You don't need to use crypto. Bonds can be traditional financial instruments.
2. Blockchain is just a public database. Like email or the internet - a tool.

**We use blockchain for**:

- Transparency (everyone sees the money flow)
- Automation (smart contracts execute automatically)
- Incorruptibility (no humans can redirect funds)

**You don't have to like blockchain. You just benefit from what it enables.**

## "What If the Science Is Wrong?"

**Objection**: "What if we fund trials and nothing gets cured?"

**Response**:

**Worst case**: We run 100,000 trials, learn what doesn't work, refine approach.

**That's still better than**:

- Current system: Run 100 trials over 17 years
- NIH: Fund safe research that discovers nothing
- FDA: Block trials entirely

**Science works through experimentation.** The dFDA lets us experiment 82X faster and cheaper.

**Even if 90% of trials fail, we still get 10X more cures than today.**

## "I'll Wait and See If It Works"

**Objection**: "I'll support it once I see results."

**Response**:

**Problem**: It can't work without you.

- Need 280M votes to pass treaty
- Need $1-3B bonds to fund campaign
- Need sharing to reach critical mass

**If everyone waits for everyone else, nothing happens.**

**Classic collective action problem**: Everyone benefits if it succeeds, but only if enough people participate.

**Your choices**:

1. Participate now → Might succeed
2. Wait → Definitely fails

**While you wait, 150,000 people die today.**

## "I Don't Have Time"

**Objection**: "I'm too busy to deal with this."

**Response**:

**Time required**:

- Vote: 2 minutes
- Buy bonds: 10 minutes
- Share: 15 minutes
- **Total: 27 minutes**

**Time you'll save** if diseases are cured:

- No more doctor visits: Hundreds of hours
- No more sick days: Hundreds of hours
- Extra years of life: Tens of thousands of hours

**ROI**: 27 minutes for potentially 50,000 extra hours of life.

**You have time. You just haven't prioritized not dying.**

## "This Is Unrealistic"

**Objection**: "This will never happen. You're being naive about human nature."

**Response**: Everything was unrealistic until it happened.

**Things that were "unrealistic"**:

- Human flight (impossible for millennia, then Wright Brothers)
- Landing on the moon (JFK made it happen in 9 years)
- Democracy (kings ruled for 5,000 years, then didn't)
- Ending slavery (the entire economy depended on it)
- Women voting (half the population was excluded)
- The internet (who needs computers talking to each other?)
- Bitcoin hitting $100K (magic internet money worth more than gold)

**What's actually unrealistic**:

- Continuing to spend $2.7T on weapons while 55 million die annually
- Expecting different results from the same broken system
- Thinking we can survive the AI revolution without fixing incentives

**Reality check**: 69 million people are dying unnecessarily each year. That's what's truly unrealistic to accept.

## "You Can't Avoid War in the Real World"

**Objection**: "War is human nature. Countries need militaries to survive."

**Response**: Multiple countries prove otherwise.

**Switzerland**:

- 200+ years avoiding major wars
- Surrounded by both World Wars
- GDP per capita: $93,000 (higher than US)
- Defense spending: 0.7% of GDP
- Life expectancy: 84 years
- Proof that neutrality creates wealth

**Costa Rica**:

- Abolished their army in 1948
- Still sovereign 75+ years later
- Redirected military budget to education and health
- Life expectancy now matches the US at fraction of cost
- Zero invasions since abolishing military

**The pattern**: Countries that choose peace get richer. Countries that choose war get poorer.

**The real world**: Nuclear weapons made territorial conquest obsolete. We're still acting like it's 1945.

## "But All Wars on X Have Failed"

**Objection**: "War on Drugs, War on Poverty, War on Terror all failed. This will too."

**Response**: Those were government wars using central planning. This uses markets.

**Why government "wars" fail**:

- Create bureaucracies that need the problem to exist
- War on Drugs: DEA needs drug crime for budget
- War on Poverty: Welfare offices need poor people
- War on Terror: Defense contractors need enemies
- Central planning can't solve complex problems

**Why the War on Disease is different**:

- Uses markets, not ministries
- Pays for outcomes, not process
- No bureaucracy to preserve (smart contracts)
- Competition between solutions
- Researchers paid for cures, not grants

**The War on Disease is really the Market for Health.**

We're not declaring war. We're declaring peace with biology and letting capitalism do what it does best: optimize.

## The Bottom Line

Every objection has an answer.
Every excuse has a counter.
Every "but" has a "so what."

**The truth is simple**:

- Current system kills 55M/year
- Here's a solution that works
- It requires your participation
- You have no good reason to refuse

**Either participate or admit you prefer the death system.**

**Choose.**
