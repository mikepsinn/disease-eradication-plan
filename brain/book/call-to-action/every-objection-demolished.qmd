title: 💥 Every Objection Demolished
subtitle: The FAQ That Ends All Excuses
---
## "This Will Never Work"

**Objection**: "Nice idea, but it's too ambitious. It'll never actually happen."

**Response**: The Oxford RECOVERY trial already proved decentralized trials work. They:

- Tested 7 treatments in 6 months
- Saved 1 million lives
- Cost $500 per patient (vs FDA's $41,000)
- Used existing hospital systems

We're just scaling what already succeeded.

**Follow-up**: "But globally?"
**Response**: The internet scaled globally. Smartphones scaled globally. COVID vaccines scaled globally. Medical trials are easier than those.

## "We Need the Military Budget"

**Objection**: "We can't reduce military spending. That would make us vulnerable."

**Response**: We're taking 1%. You keep 99%.

- Current US military: $850B
- After 1% reduction: $841.5B
- Difference: $8.5B (one aircraft carrier every 2 years)

This isn't about vulnerability; it's about math. Since every nation reduces its military spending by the same percentage under the treaty, the relative balance of power remains unchanged. No one gains a strategic advantage. In fact, your national security *increases* because all your enemies have 1% fewer bombs, bio-weapons, and fancy jets to point at you.

Think of it as upgrading your security system. You're trading one rusty bayonet for a planetary-scale immune system. The greatest threats today aren't tanks rolling over a border; they're microbes rolling through an airport, or the Skynet knockoff your defense department is building with your tax dollars. A pandemic, natural or engineered, can kill more people than our entire nuclear arsenal—all 13,000 warheads of it—and crash the global economy without firing a shot. Which is a better investment for survival: another bomber, or a system that can stop the next Black Death in its tracks?

Besides, strong nations don't get invaded. And what makes a nation strong? Not just bombs. It’s healthy, productive people. A country drowning in cancer and Alzheimer's is weak, brittle, and broke. Broke, miserable countries get cranky and start wars. Curing disease is preventative defense. It strengthens your country from the inside out, making it too prosperous and stable to bother fighting.

And let's talk about influence. You can spend a trillion dollars on "hard power" to make other countries fear you. Or you can spend a fraction of that on curing their citizens' diseases and have them love you. Who has more real power: the world's scary policeman, or the world's beloved doctor? This isn't charity; it's the cheapest and most effective foreign policy ever invented.

**Follow-up**: "But what if enemies don't reduce?"
**Response**: That's literally the point of a treaty. Everyone signs simultaneously. Anyone who doesn't sign gets international pressure and looks like they want people to die.

## "Big Pharma Will Block This"

**Objection**: "Pharmaceutical companies will kill this. They profit from disease."

**Response**: Under DIH, pharma makes MORE money, not less.

**Current system**:

- Pharma pays $2.6B for trials
- 90% of drugs fail
- Only blockbusters are profitable
- Net: Often losses

**DIH system**:

- Patients pay pharma to run trials (via subsidy)
- Trials become revenue, not cost
- Every drug becomes profitable
- Net: Guaranteed profit

**Pharma will lobby FOR us, not against us.**

## "You Can't Trust 8 Billion People"

**Objection**: "Letting everyone decide is mob rule. We need experts."

**Response**: We trust 8 billion people to:

- Use the internet safely
- Drive cars
- Vote for people with nuclear codes
- Decide what to buy, eat, and do

But we can't trust them to click YES on "should we cure disease"? Besides, polls consistently show people would rather their money be used for medical research than warfare. You're not fighting public opinion; you're unleashing it.

**Follow-up**: "But they're not qualified!"
**Response**: Princeton proved experts (200-person NIH committee) haven't cured anything in 50 years. Maybe qualification isn't working.

## "What About National Sovereignty?"

**Objection**: "This forces countries to spend money a certain way. That violates sovereignty."

**Response**: No force involved. Countries voluntarily sign a treaty.

- Don't want to sign? Don't sign.
- Citizens demand it? Then sign.
- That's how democracy works.

**Follow-up**: "What if our government doesn't want to?"
**Response**: Vote them out. That's also how democracy works.

## "This Is Socialism/Communism"

**Objection**: "Government controlling healthcare spending is socialist!"

**Response**:

1.  We're not controlling healthcare. We're funding research.
2.  Military spending is already "socialized" (government spending).
3.  We're just moving 1% from one government program to another.
4.  The dFDA is decentralized markets, not central planning.
5.  VICTORY Bonds are pure capitalism (40-270% returns).

**This is the most capitalist medical system ever proposed.**

## "The FDA Exists for a Reason"

**Objection**: "We need FDA approval to ensure safety. You're being reckless."

**Response**: The FDA's caution kills more than it saves.

**FDA delays** (1962-present): 4-10 million American deaths from drug lag

**FDA-prevented disasters**: Maybe thalidomide (1,000 deaths prevented)

**Net**: FDA has killed 4,000-10,000 people for every person it saved.

**Under dFDA**: Patients see real data on risks/benefits and decide for themselves. Adults making informed choices about their own bodies.

## "What If Countries Cheat?"

**Objection**: "Countries will promise to reduce military spending but won't actually do it."

**Response**: Blockchain verification, backed by satellites that can read the serial number on a tank from orbit and good old-fashioned on-site inspections.

- Every contribution is public
- Smart contracts enforce allocation
- Anyone can audit in real-time
- Cheating is immediately visible to the entire world.

The diplomatic fallout for the country that decides it prefers global disease is... considerable. **Unlike traditional treaties** (based on trust), **this one is based on code and paranoia**.

## "You're Being Too Negative About Research"

**Objection**: "The NIH does good work! You're being unfair."

**Response**: The NIH has:

- $48B annual budget
- 50 years of operation
- Thousands of researchers
- Zero diseases eradicated

**Meanwhile smallpox** was eradicated by:

- Global coordination
- Decentralized implementation
- Direct patient access
- 10-year timeline

Even if your country already spends a lot on research, it's not enough. A virus doesn't check passports. A breakthrough in one country can save lives in all of them. This plan pools our resources. Instead of 195 countries independently trying to invent the lightbulb, we're building a global power grid. It's just more efficient.

**The NIH model doesn't work. The smallpox model does. We're using the one that works.**

## "This Is Too Good to Be True"

**Objection**: "40-270% returns? Curing disease? This sounds like a scam."

**Response**:

**The returns** are high because:

- We're capturing value from a $109T disease burden. This could yield $1.2 million in benefits per person globally over their lifetime.
- 10% of $27B yearly inflows
- Divided among bondholders
- Math checks out

**The cures** are achievable because:

- Oxford proved the model works
- We're removing the FDA bottleneck
- 82X cost reduction
- Timeline matches historical eradication efforts

**It sounds too good because we've been failing for so long, we forgot what success looks like.**

## "You Can't Cure Aging"

**Objection**: "Aging is natural and inevitable. You can't fight nature."

**Response**: We replace everything else that breaks.

- Hearts: We replace them (artificial hearts, transplants)
- Kidneys: We replace them (dialysis, transplants)
- Blood: We replace it (transfusions daily)
- Bones: We replace them (titanium upgrades)
- Joints: We replace them (hip replacements routine)

**Aging is just damage accumulation**:

- Telomeres shorten: We can lengthen them (telomerase activation)
- Cells senesce: We can clear them (senolytic drugs)
- Proteins misfold: We can refold them (molecular chaperones)
- Mitochondria fail: We can replace them (mitochondrial transfer)
- DNA breaks: We can repair it (CRISPR, base editing)

**We went to the moon with slide rules. We can fix cells with AI.**

Your body is a machine. Machines can be repaired. Aging is just harder engineering, not magic.

## "I'm Just One Person"

**Objection**: "My vote/investment/share won't matter. I'm too small."

**Response**:

**Every movement** started with individuals:

- Civil rights: Rosa Parks
- Women's suffrage: Individual women voting
- End of slavery: Started with individuals opposing it

**3.5% rule**: This needs 280 million people. You're 1/280,000,000 of that.

**But if you share with 10**, you're 1/28,000,000.
**If they share with 10**, you're 1/2,800,000.
**6 degrees**, you've reached millions.

**You're not too small. You're the beginning.**

## "The Government Will Steal the Money"

**Objection**: "You create a $27B fund, politicians will redirect it to their friends."

**Response**: They can't. Smart contracts.

**Traditional budget**:

- Congress allocates money
- Bureaucrats decide spending
- Lobbying influences decisions
- Money gets stolen

**DIH Treasury**:

- Smart contract holds money
- Code executes automatically
- No human can redirect
- No committees, no grant-writing, no begging

The code doesn't just guard the money; it spends it smarter than any human could. It automatically routes funding to the trials with the highest probability of success, based on data, not politics. Just math finding cures.

**If politicians could steal it, we wouldn't be using this system.**

## "We Should Fix Current System, Not Replace It"

**Objection**: "Why not just reform the FDA and NIH?"

**Response**: People have been trying for 50 years.

- More funding? Tried. No diseases cured.
- Different leadership? Tried. Same results.
- New regulations? Tried. Slower approvals.
- Reform bills? Tried. Lobbyists kill them.

**The system can't be fixed because the system IS working—for the people in power.**

Defense contractors spend about $300 million a year on lobbying and get back nearly a trillion dollars in government contracts. That's not a broken system; that's the best return on investment on Earth. They aren't going to give that up because you asked nicely.

**The system won't reform itself. Build around it instead.**

## "This Is Politically Impossible"

**Objection**: "No government will agree to this. It's fantasy."

**Response**: Politicians don't lead; they follow the path of least resistance and most money. So, here's how you make this the easiest, most profitable decision of their careers.

The military-industrial complex stays in power by spending about $300 million a year on lobbyists to keep their trillion-dollar budgets safe. You can't beat them with moral arguments. You have to beat them at their own game.

Here's how you do it: you crowdfund a $40 million war chest with the first sale of VICTORY Bonds. Then, you go to the same K-Street lobbying firms the defense contractors use, and you outbid them for their top talent.

You hire their best mercenaries to work for you.

Lobbyists are financially motivated. Their job is to work for the highest bidder. So, you become the highest bidder. You cripple their lobbying machine by buying it out from under them. Suddenly, politicians start hearing a lot more about the votes and donations to be gained by curing cancer, and a lot less about the threat of some country they can't find on a map.

This isn't a fantasy. It's a hostile takeover of the political influence market. And once 280 million voters are demanding it, it becomes politically impossible to refuse.

## "I Don't Trust Blockchain/Crypto"

**Objection**: "Blockchain is a scam. I don't want my money in crypto."

**Response**:

**Two things**:

1.  You don't need to use crypto. Bonds can be traditional financial instruments.
2.  Blockchain is just a public database. Like the internet, it's a neutral tool. Thugs use it, but so do hospitals.

**We use blockchain for one reason: it's incorruptible.**

- **Transparency**: Everyone sees where every dollar goes.
- **Automation**: Smart contracts execute rules without human meddling.
- **Incorruptibility**: No politician or bureaucrat can stick their hands in the pot.

**You don't have to like blockchain. You just have to like the fact that it makes theft impossible.**

## "What If the Science Is Wrong?"

**Objection**: "What if we fund trials and nothing gets cured?"

**Response**:

**Worst case**: We run 100,000 trials and learn, with absolute certainty, 100,000 things that don't work. This data alone is more valuable than anything the NIH has produced in decades.

**That's still better than**:

- Current system: Run 100 trials over 17 years
- NIH: Fund safe research that discovers nothing
- FDA: Block trials entirely

**Science works through experimentation.** The dFDA lets us experiment 82X faster and cheaper.

**Even if 90% of trials fail, we still get 10X more cures than today.**

## "I'll Wait and See If It Works"

**Objection**: "I'll support it once I see results."

**Response**:

**Problem**: It can't work without you.

- Need 280M votes to pass treaty
- Need $1-3B bonds to fund campaign
- Need sharing to reach critical mass

**If everyone waits for everyone else, nothing happens.**

This is a classic collective action problem. A burning building where everyone waits for someone else to call the fire department.

**Your choices**:

1.  Participate now → Might succeed
2.  Wait → Definitely fails

**While you wait, 150,000 people die today.**

## "I Don't Have Time"

**Objection**: "I'm too busy to deal with this."

**Response**:

**Time required**:

- Vote: 2 minutes
- Buy bonds: 10 minutes
- Share: 15 minutes
- **Total: 27 minutes**

**Time you'll save** if diseases are cured:

- No more doctor visits: Hundreds of hours
- No more sick days: Hundreds of hours
- Extra years of life: Tens of thousands of hours

**ROI**: 27 minutes for potentially 50,000 extra hours of life.

**You have time. You just haven't prioritized not dying.**

## "This Is Unrealistic"

**Objection**: "This will never happen. You're being naive about human nature."

**Response**: Everything was unrealistic until it happened.

**Things that were "unrealistic"**:

- Human flight (impossible for millennia, then Wright Brothers)
- Landing on the moon (JFK made it happen in 9 years)
- Democracy (kings ruled for 5,000 years, then didn't)
- Ending slavery (the entire economy depended on it)
- Women voting (half the population was excluded)
- The internet (who needs computers talking to each other?)

**What's actually unrealistic**:

- Continuing to spend $2.7T on weapons while sitting on 13,000 nuclear warheads, enough to cause an extinction-level event 130 times over.
- Expecting different results from the same broken system.
- Thinking we can survive the AI revolution without fixing incentives.

**Reality check**: 69 million people are dying unnecessarily each year. That's what's truly unrealistic to accept.

## "You Can't Avoid War in the Real World"

**Objection**: "War is human nature. Countries need militaries to survive."

**Response**: Multiple countries prove otherwise.

**Switzerland**:

- 200+ years avoiding major wars
- Surrounded by both World Wars
- GDP per capita: $93,000 (higher than US)
- Defense spending: 0.7% of GDP
- Life expectancy: 84 years
- Proof that neutrality creates wealth

**Costa Rica**:

- Abolished their army in 1948
- Still sovereign 75+ years later
- Redirected military budget to education and health
- Life expectancy now matches the US at a fraction of the cost
- Zero invasions since abolishing military

**The pattern**: Countries that choose peace get richer. Countries that choose war get poorer. They prove that countries drained by disease and poverty are unstable. They pick fights. Countries that invest in their own people become too rich and healthy to bother with the expensive stupidity of war.

**The real world**: Nuclear weapons made territorial conquest obsolete. We're still acting like it's 1945.

## "But All Wars on X Have Failed"

**Objection**: "War on Drugs, War on Poverty, War on Terror all failed. This will too."

**Response**: Those were government wars using central planning. This uses markets.

**Why government "wars" fail**:

- Create bureaucracies that need the problem to exist
- War on Drugs: DEA needs drug crime for budget
- War on Poverty: Welfare offices need poor people
- War on Terror: Defense contractors need enemies
- Central planning can't solve complex problems

**Why the War on Disease is different**:

- Uses markets, not ministries
- Pays for outcomes, not process
- No bureaucracy to preserve (smart contracts)
- Competition between solutions
- Researchers paid for cures, not grants

**The War on Disease is really the Market for Health.**

We're not declaring war. We're declaring peace with biology and letting capitalism do what it does best: optimize.

## The Bottom Line

Every objection has an answer.
Every excuse has a counter.
Every "but" has a "so what."

**The truth is simple**:

- Premise one: Not dying is good.
- Premise two: War makes people die.
- Premise three: Medical research makes people not die.
- Conclusion: Move money from the "die" column to the "not die" column.

The current system kills 69 million people a year. Here's a solution that works. It requires your participation. You have no good reason to refuse.

**Either participate or admit you prefer the death system.**

**Choose.**
