## What You're Building

Create a funding mechanism that raises $1 billion to finance the [1% Treaty](../appendix/1-percent-treaty.qmd) campaign through perpetual revenue-sharing bonds.

**The structure to build:**
- Raise $1 billion from bond investors
- Use funds to execute the treaty campaign
- Once treaty passes, $27B annually flows from military budgets to [DIH](../solution/dih.qmd)
- Pay bondholders 10% of treaty inflows perpetually
- Use remaining 90% for medical research

**Investor pitch:** 270% annual returns if treaty passes at full scale

**Key feature:** Perpetual revenue share (no maturity date) keeps investors aligned with long-term success

## How to Execute the Four Phases

### Phase 1: Raise the Initial $1 Billion

Set up the bond offering and raise capital from investors.

**Target investors:**
- Institutional investors ($10M+ each)
- Family offices ($5M+ each)
- High net worth individuals ($1M+ each)
- Qualified investors ($100K+ each)

Use the capital structure detailed below.

### Phase 2: Execute the Campaign

Deploy the $1B raised:
- Get 280M people to vote for the treaty ($0.20/vote = $56M)
- Lobby 20 strategic countries ($250M, AI-targeted)
- Build the [dFDA](../solution/dfda.qmd) and [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) platforms ($250M, AI-assisted)
- Handle all legal, compliance, and partnerships ($444M)

See @sec-campaign-budget for detailed allocation.

### Phase 3: Implement Treaty Revenue Flow

Once treaty passes, set up the revenue distribution system:
- $27B annually flows from military budgets to DIH treasury
- Automatic payment to bondholders: 10% of all inflows
- Remaining 90% flows to medical research operations

### Phase 4: Manage Perpetual Distributions

Set up automated annual payments:
- **Year 1**: $2.7B distributed to bondholders
- **Year 2**: $2.7B distributed to bondholders
- **Year 3**: $2.7B distributed to bondholders
- **Year 4+**: Scale up as treaty expands (2% = $5.4B, 5% = $13.5B, etc.)

Continue indefinitely—no maturity date means revenue never stops as long as treaty remains in force.

## Calculate Your Numbers for Investors

### Show Them the Revenue Math

**Current global military spending**: [$2.7 trillion/year](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)

**What the 1% Treaty redirects**: 1% = $27B/year to medical research

**What bondholders get**: 10% of $27B = $2.7B/year

**What funds research**: 90% of $27B = $24.3B/year

**What countries keep**: 99% of military budgets = $2.67T

This shows investors they're not "taking" research money—90% goes to cures.

### Project Growth Scenarios for Your Pitch

Design the treaty to start at 1% and expand as breakthroughs prove the model:

| Year | Treaty % | Annual Revenue | Bondholder Payment | Investor ROI |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1-3  | 1%       | $27B           | $2.7B             | 270%         |
| 4-7  | 2%       | $54B           | $5.4B             | 540%         |
| 8-10 | 5%       | $135B          | $13.5B            | 1,350%       |
| 10+  | 10%+     | $270B+         | $27B+             | 2,700%+      |

**Explain the growth mechanism to investors:**
- Early medical breakthroughs validate the model
- Mid-stage results build political momentum
- Long-term cures create unstoppable public demand

Frame it as: Politicians face electoral suicide if they oppose expansion after cures emerge.

### Structure the Security Package

Give bondholders these five layers of security:

1. **$27B+ annual treaty revenue stream** (starts year 1 if treaty passes)
2. **Political entrenchment** (treaties are historically hard to repeal once implemented)
3. **Public support** (70%+ approval, grows with each cure)
4. **Aligned incentives** (everyone profits from cooperation)
5. **First-lien position** (bondholders get paid before any discretionary spending)

Explain to investors: Multiple layers of protection, not just one point of failure.

## Present Two Scenarios to Investors

### Scenario A: Full Success ($27B/year)

Show investors what full treaty adoption looks like:

**Treaty adoption**: 100+ countries (all major military powers)
**Annual DIH revenue**: $27B
**Bondholder annual payment**: $2.7B (10%)
**Research funding**: $24.3B (90%)
**Investor ROI**: 270% annually

**What happens**:
- Medical research accelerates dramatically
- Disease burden declines measurably
- Public support grows stronger
- Political momentum builds for 2%, then 5% expansion
- Returns scale up proportionally

### Scenario B: Partial Success ($13B/year)

Show investors the downside case is still attractive:

**Treaty adoption**: US, EU, UK only ([~50% of global military spending](../references.qmd#us-eu-military-spending-share))
**Annual DIH revenue**: $13B
**Bondholder annual payment**: $1.3B (10%)
**Research funding**: $11.7B (90%)
**Investor ROI**: 130% annually

**What happens**:
- 130% returns still crush traditional investments
- Partial funding still produces major breakthroughs
- Early-adopter success creates FOMO in other nations
- Additional countries join over time
- Returns grow toward full scenario

**Key pitch point:** Even the "bad" scenario beats every other investment.

## Explain Why You Chose 10%

Structure the allocation to balance three goals:

1. **Attract sufficient capital**: 270% projected returns compete with high-risk VC/hedge funds
2. **Fund the mission**: 90% ($24.3B) gives researchers substantial capital
3. **Align incentives**: Bondholders profit from treaty expansion, so they become advocates

Tell investors: Everyone wins when treaties grow—more cures = bigger treaties = higher returns.

## Set Up the Legal Structure

### Structure the Bond Instrument

**Instrument type**: Create as senior secured debt

**Priority**: Give first lien on all DIH treaty revenue

**Term**: Make perpetual (no maturity date)

**Payment**: Set annual distributions in stable currency (USD or basket)

**Transferability**: Allow secondary market trading

**Governance**: Grant bondholder seats on DIH oversight board

### Create Milestone-Based Releases

Protect investors by releasing funds in tranches tied to achievements:

**Phase 1 milestone ($200M release)**:
- Launch platform MVP
- Achieve 50M+ referendum votes
- Complete successful pilots in 2 countries
- Establish legal framework

**Phase 2 milestone ($500M release)**:
- Reach 280M+ total referendum votes
- Get treaties pending in 20+ countries
- Scale platform to 10M users
- Secure defense industry partnerships

**Phase 3 milestone ($300M release)**:
- Get treaty signed by 50+ countries
- Achieve $13B+ annual revenue flowing
- Have dFDA processing trials
- Demonstrate irreversible momentum

**Set up protection**: Hold all funds in escrow, refund if milestones aren't hit

### Address Each Risk Category

**Mitigate political risk:**
- Build multi-country strategy (don't depend on one nation)
- Create bipartisan coalitions (avoid partisan framing)
- Leverage [>70% public support](../references.qmd#public-support-for-peace-funding-70-pct) (politicians can't ignore)

**Mitigate execution risk:**
- Use milestone-gated funding (pay for performance)
- Deploy AI for 80% cost reduction
- Follow proven model (defense lobbying gets [1813:1 ROI](../references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc))

**Mitigate financial risk:**
- Structure first-lien security (get paid before mission spending)
- Build multiple revenue streams (treaty grows over time)
- Show downside protection (even 50% success = 130% returns)

**Mitigate legal risk**:
- Ensure multi-jurisdiction compliance
- Use AI-assisted legal work + expert review
- Budget $100M for legal defense

## Show Investors the Comparison

### Create This Comparison Table for Your Pitch

| Investment | Annual Return | Risk Level | Term |
|------------|---------------|------------|------|
| **VICTORY Bonds** | **270%*** | **High** | **Perpetual** |
| Savings Account | 0.5% | Minimal | Liquid |
| S&P 500 | 10% | Moderate | Liquid |
| Real Estate | 8% | Moderate | 30 years |
| Venture Capital | 15-25% | Extreme | 7-10 years |
| Hedge Funds | 8-15% | High | Variable lock-up |
| Medallion Fund | [39%](../references.qmd#top-pe-hedge-funds) | Extreme | Closed to new investors |
| Warren Buffett career avg. | [20%](../references.qmd#warren-buffett-career-average-return-20-pct) | Moderate | 60 years |

*Remind investors: Returns assume full treaty passage. Actual results depend on political outcomes.

**Pitch angle**: Even with high risk, the upside crushes everything except closed funds.

**Explain the flywheel to investors:**
1. Treaty passes → Bondholders get first distributions
2. DIH funds trials → Breakthroughs start emerging
3. Media covers wins → Public awareness explodes
4. Public demands more → Politicians face electoral pressure
5. Treaty % increases → Revenue scales up dramatically
6. More cures emerge → Cycle reinforces itself
7. Long-term result: Compounding returns + saved lives

**Frame it as**: Success creates more success—self-reinforcing growth mechanism.

## Set Minimum Investment Thresholds

**Investor lock-up period**: Tell investors funds are locked 12-36 months until treaty passes, then perpetual distributions begin.

### Structure Your Minimums

Set these minimum investment amounts by investor type:

- **Institutional investors**: $10M+ per investor
- **Family offices**: $5M+ per office
- **High net worth individuals**: $1M+ per person
- **Qualified investors**: $100K+ minimum

*(Adjust based on your final regulatory structure and jurisdiction requirements)*

### Draft Your Term Sheet

*(Have lawyers review—this is illustrative only)*

- **Interest rate**: 0% (all returns via revenue share model)
- **Revenue share**: 10% of all treaty inflows
- **Term**: Perpetual (no maturity date)
- **Payment frequency**: Annual distributions
- **Default provisions**: Transparent reporting, third-party audits
- **Transferability**: Tradable on secondary market after 12 months
- **Governance**: Grant bondholder board representation

## Handle Common Investor Objections

### When they say: "This sounds too good to be true"

**Respond with:**

"The returns are high because the risk is high. This is venture-level risk.

The model follows proven economics: defense lobbying gets 1813:1 ROI. Apply the same mechanism to medical research.

The 270% reflects:
1. Access to $27B/year revenue (if treaty passes)
2. Treaties are hard to repeal once implemented
3. Political momentum builds from results
4. Everyone profits from cooperation"

### When they ask: "What if the treaty doesn't pass?"

**Show them the protection:**

"Milestone-gated funding protects you:
- Funds held in escrow
- Released only when verified achievements hit
- Refund if targets missed

Even partial success pays well:
- 50% treaty adoption = 130% annual returns
- Still beats every traditional investment

Worst case scenario:
- Total failure, get money back minus expenses
- Lose 5-10% of capital"

### When they ask: "What if countries stop paying?"

**Explain enforcement:**

"Multiple enforcement layers:
- Blockchain tracking (automatic verification)
- Satellite imagery (verify spending)
- Smart contract penalties (non-compliance locks out benefits)
- Public pressure (transparent to voters)
- Economic incentives (access to cures requires payment)

Political reality:
- Once passed, near-impossible to repeal (like Social Security)
- Each cure makes it more popular
- Politicians who oppose get replaced"

### When they ask: "How is this different from philanthropy?"

**Clarify:**

"Philanthropy = donation with zero return

VICTORY Bonds = for-profit investment with 270% projected returns

This isn't charity. It's a high-risk investment that happens to save lives."

### When they ask about risks

**Be honest:**

"Four main risks:
- **Liquidity**: Funds locked 12-36 months during campaign
- **Political**: Must change laws across multiple countries
- **Execution**: Campaign must hit milestones (gates mitigate this)
- **Timeline**: Returns start in 18-36 months, not immediately

Not a Ponzi: Returns come from treaty revenue, not new investor money."
