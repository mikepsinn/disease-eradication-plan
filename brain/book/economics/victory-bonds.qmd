## What You're Building

Create a funding mechanism that raises $1.0B to finance the [1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) campaign through perpetual revenue-sharing bonds.

### The structure to build

- Raise $1.0B from bond investors
- Use funds to execute the treaty campaign
- Once treaty passes, $27.2B annually flows from military budgets to [DIH](../solution/dih.qmd)
- Pay bondholders 10% of treaty inflows perpetually
- Use remaining 90% for medical research

**Investor pitch:** 271.8% annual returns if treaty passes at full scale

**Key feature:** Perpetual revenue share (no maturity date) keeps investors aligned with long-term success

## How to Execute the Four Phases

### Phase 1: Raise the Initial $1.0B

Set up the bond offering and raise capital from investors.

#### Target investors

- Institutional investors ($10M+ each)
- Family offices ($5M+ each)
- High net worth individuals ($1M+ each)
- Qualified investors ($100K+ each)

Use the capital structure detailed below.

### Phase 2: Execute the Campaign

Deploy the $1.0B raised according to the [Campaign Budget](campaign-budget.qmd):

- **Viral referendum campaign** (280M votes through AI-optimized referral system)
- **Strategic lobbying** (AI-targeted campaigns in 20 key countries)
- **Technology platform** ([dFDA](../solution/dfda.qmd) and [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) development)
- **Legal and compliance** (AI-assisted with expert review)
- **Strategic partnerships** (co-opt defense industry, align insurers)
- **Operations and implementation** (lean, AI-augmented teams)

For the complete breakdown of how every dollar is spent, see the [Campaign Budget](campaign-budget.qmd) chapter.

### Phase 3: Implement Treaty Revenue Flow

Once treaty passes, set up the revenue distribution system:

- $27.2B annually flows from military budgets to DIH treasury
- Automatic payment to bondholders: 10% of all inflows
- Remaining 90% flows to medical research operations

### Phase 4: Manage Perpetual Distributions

Set up automated annual payments:

- **Year 1**: 2.7B distributed to bondholders
- **Year 2**: 2.7B distributed to bondholders
- **Year 3**: 2.7B distributed to bondholders
- **Year 4+**: Scale up as treaty expands (2% = $5.4B, 5% = $13.5B, etc.)

Continue indefinitely, no maturity date means revenue never stops as long as treaty remains in force.

## Calculate Your Numbers for Investors

### Show Them the Revenue Math

**Current global military spending**: [$2.7 trillion/year](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)

**What the 1% Treaty redirects**: 1% = $27.2B/year to medical research

**What bondholders get**: 
$$ 10\% \times \$27\text{B} = \$2.7\text{B}/\text{year} $$

**What funds research**: 
$$ 90\% \times \$27\text{B} = \$24.3\text{B}/\text{year} $$

**What countries keep**: 
$$ 99\% \times \text{military budgets} = \$2.67\text{T} $$

This shows investors they're not "taking" research money—90% goes to cures.

### The Total Lifetime Value (NPV of Perpetuity)

Since VICTORY Bonds are **perpetual** (no maturity date), the total present value is calculated using the standard perpetuity formula:

$$
\text{NPV} = \frac{\text{Annual Payment}}{\text{Discount Rate}} = \frac{\$2.7\text{B}}{r}
$$

**Conservative scenarios:**

| Discount Rate | NPV | Multiple on $1B Investment |
|---------------|-----|---------------------------|
| 3% | $90B | 90x |
| 5% | $54B | 54x |
| 10% | $27B | 27x |

Even at a very conservative 10% discount rate (typical for high-risk ventures), your $1B investment is worth $27B in total present value.

**Translation:** You're not just getting 271.8% per year. You're getting the equivalent of **$54-90 billion** in total lifetime wealth, depending on how you value future cash flows.

**This is Finance 101 for perpetuities** - but it's worth stating explicitly because it makes the value proposition crystal clear:

- **Annual returns**: 271.8% (sounds impressive)
- **Total NPV**: 54x-90x (sounds impossible, but it's math)

Unlike venture capital (3-5x over 7-10 years), real estate (2-3x over 30 years), or even the Medallion Fund (39% annually but closed to new investors), VICTORY Bonds offer perpetual returns that compound into generational wealth.

The perpetual nature isn't a bug - it's the feature. As long as the treaty remains in force, the money never stops.

### Project Growth Scenarios for Your Pitch

Design the treaty to start at 1% and expand as breakthroughs prove the model:

| Year | Treaty % | Annual Revenue | Bondholder Payment | Investor ROI |
|------|----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 1-3  | 1%       | $27.2B           | 2.7B             | 271.8%         |
| 4-7  | 2%       | $54B           | $5.4B             | 540%         |
| 8-10 | 5%       | $135B          | $13.5B            | 1,350%       |
| 10+  | 10%+     | $270B+         | $27.2B+             | 2,700%+      |

#### Explain the growth mechanism to investors

- Early medical breakthroughs validate the model
- Mid-stage results build political momentum
- Long-term cures create unstoppable public demand

Frame it as: Politicians face electoral suicide if they oppose expansion after cures emerge.

### Structure the Security Package

Give bondholders these five layers of security:

1. **$27.2B+ annual treaty revenue stream** (starts year 1 if treaty passes)
2. **Political entrenchment** (treaties are historically hard to repeal once implemented)
3. **Public support** (70%+ approval, grows with each cure)
4. **Aligned incentives** (everyone profits from cooperation)
5. **First-lien position** (bondholders get paid before any discretionary spending)

Explain to investors: Multiple layers of protection, not just one point of failure.

## Present Two Scenarios to Investors

### Scenario A: Full Success ($27.2B/year)

Show investors what full treaty adoption looks like:

**Treaty adoption**: 100+ countries (all major military powers)
**Annual DIH revenue**: $27.2B
**Bondholder annual payment**: 2.7B (10%)
**Research funding**: $24.3B (90%)
**Investor ROI**: 271.8% annually

**What happens**:

- Medical research accelerates dramatically
- Disease burden declines measurably
- Public support grows stronger
- Political momentum builds for 2%, then 5% expansion
- Returns scale up proportionally

### Scenario B: Partial Success ($13B/year)

Show investors the downside case is still attractive:

**Treaty adoption**: US, EU, UK only ([~50% of global military spending](../references.qmd#us-eu-military-spending-share))
**Annual DIH revenue**: $13B
**Bondholder annual payment**: $1.3B (10%)
**Research funding**: $11.7B (90%)
**Investor ROI**: 130% annually

**What happens**:

- 130% returns still crush traditional investments
- Partial funding still produces major breakthroughs
- Early-adopter success creates FOMO in other nations
- Additional countries join over time
- Returns grow toward full scenario

**Key pitch point:** Even the conservative scenario outperforms most traditional investments.

## Explain Why You Chose 10%

Structure the allocation to balance three goals:

1. **Attract sufficient capital**: 271.8% projected returns compete with high-risk VC/hedge funds
2. **Fund the mission**: 90% ($24.3B) gives researchers substantial capital
3. **Align incentives**: Bondholders profit from treaty expansion, so they become advocates

Tell investors: Everyone wins when treaties grow, more cures = bigger treaties = higher returns.

## Set Up the Legal Structure

The VICTORY Bonds are issued by **The Victory Corporation**, a for-profit Delaware C-Corp. This entity serves as the financial "Engine" of the entire operation, designed to attract for-profit capital to fund the political and social mission.

This structure legally separates the investment activities from the philanthropic and lobbying arms of the organization. For a complete breakdown of the four-part hybrid legal model, see the [Legal Architecture](../legal/legal-framework.qmd) chapter.

### Structure the Bond Instrument

**Instrument type**: Create as senior secured debt

**Priority**: Give first lien on all DIH treaty revenue

**Term**: Make perpetual (no maturity date)

**Payment**: Set annual distributions in stable currency (USD or basket)

**Transferability**: Allow secondary market trading

**Governance**: Grant bondholder seats on DIH oversight board

### Create Milestone-Based Releases

Protect investors by releasing funds in tranches tied to achievements:

**Phase 1 milestone ($200M release)**:

- Launch platform MVP
- Achieve 50M+ referendum votes
- Complete successful pilots in 2 countries
- Establish legal framework

**Phase 2 milestone ($500M release)**:

- Reach 280M+ total referendum votes
- Get treaties pending in 20+ countries
- Scale platform to 10M users
- Secure defense industry partnerships

**Phase 3 milestone ($300M release)**:

- Get treaty signed by 50+ countries
- Achieve $13B+ annual revenue flowing
- Have dFDA processing trials
- Demonstrate irreversible momentum

**Set up protection**: Hold all funds in escrow, refund if milestones aren't hit

### Address Each Risk Category

The investment carries two primary types of risk: **Project Risks**, which are inherent to the success of the campaign, and **Investor-Specific Risks**, which relate to the nature of the financial instrument.

#### Project Risks

- **Political Risk:** The treaty may fail to pass in key nations. You mitigate this by building broad, bipartisan public support and using a multi-country strategy to avoid single points of failure.
- **Execution Risk:** The campaign may fail to achieve its milestones. You mitigate this with milestone-gated funding, a lean operational model, and hiring an elite, experienced team.

#### Investor-Specific Risks

- **Liquidity Risk:** Funds are locked up for 18-36 months during the campaign phase before returns begin. You mitigate this by allowing secondary market trading after an initial lock-up period.
- **Timeline Risk:** The political process could take longer than projected, delaying returns. The perpetual nature of the bond is designed to reward patience.

## Show Investors the Comparison

### Create This Comparison Table for Your Pitch

| Investment | Annual Return | Risk Level | Term |
|------------|---------------|------------|------|
| **VICTORY Bonds** | **271.8%*** | **High** | **Perpetual** |
| Savings Account | 0.5% | Minimal | Liquid |
| S&P 500 | 10% | Moderate | Liquid |
| Real Estate | 8% | Moderate | 30 years |
| Venture Capital | 15-25% | Extreme | 7-10 years |
| Hedge Funds | 8-15% | High | Variable lock-up |
| Medallion Fund | [39%](../references.qmd#top-pe-hedge-funds) | Extreme | Closed to new investors |
| Warren Buffett career avg. | [20%](../references.qmd#warren-buffett-career-average-return-20-pct) | Moderate | 60 years |

*Remind investors: Returns assume full treaty passage. Actual results depend on political outcomes.

**Pitch angle**: Even accounting for high risk, this outperforms most investment classes except certain closed funds.

### Explain the flywheel to investors

1. Treaty passes → Bondholders get first distributions
2. DIH funds trials → Breakthroughs start emerging
3. Media covers wins → Public awareness explodes
4. Public demands more → Politicians face electoral pressure
5. Treaty % increases → Revenue scales up dramatically
6. More cures emerge → Cycle reinforces itself
7. Long-term result: Compounding returns + saved lives

**Frame it as**: Success creates more success, self-reinforcing growth mechanism.

## Set Minimum Investment Thresholds

**Investor lock-up period**: Tell investors funds are locked 12-36 months until treaty passes, then perpetual distributions begin.

### Structure Your Minimums

Set these minimum investment amounts by investor type:

- **Institutional investors**: $10M+ per investor
- **Family offices**: $5M+ per office
- **High net worth individuals**: $1M+ per person
- **Qualified investors**: $100K+ minimum

*(Adjust based on your final regulatory structure and jurisdiction requirements)*

### Draft Your Term Sheet

*(Have lawyers review, this is illustrative only)*

- **Interest rate**: 0% (all returns via revenue share model)
- **Revenue share**: 10% of all treaty inflows
- **Term**: Perpetual (no maturity date)
- **Payment frequency**: Annual distributions
- **Default provisions**: Transparent reporting, third-party audits
- **Transferability**: Tradable on secondary market after 12 months
- **Governance**: Grant bondholder board representation

## Handle Common Investor Objections

This section focuses on objections specific to the financial instrument. For broader philosophical, political, and feasibility objections, see the main [Demolishing Objections](../appendix/faq.qmd) chapter.

### "The returns seem unrealistic. How is this not a Ponzi scheme?"

"The returns are high because the political risk is high. This is a venture-scale bet on political change. The returns are not generated from new investors, but from a share of a new, legally mandated $27.2B annual revenue stream created by the treaty. The model is based on the proven economics of political lobbying, redirected toward a humanitarian goal."

### "What happens to my investment if the treaty fails?"

"If the treaty campaign fails to achieve at least partial success, the initial investment will be lost, as it will have been spent on the campaign. This is the primary risk. However, even a partial success scenario, such as adoption by the US and EU alone, is projected to yield over 130% annually, providing a significant return well above market averages. The risk is binary, but the upside is designed to compensate for it."

### "What are the primary risks to my investment?"

"The risks are categorized into two groups:

- **Project Risks:**
  - **Political:** The treaty may not pass. This is mitigated by building broad, bipartisan public support and using a multi-country strategy to avoid single points of failure (see "Address Each Risk Category" section above for details).
  - **Execution:** The campaign may not be run effectively. This is mitigated by milestone-based funding releases and an experienced team.

- **Investor-Specific Risks:**
  - **Liquidity:** Your capital is locked during the 18-36 month campaign.
  - **Timeline:** Political processes can be slow, potentially delaying the start of returns."

### "How is this different from a standard philanthropic donation?"

"Philanthropy is a donation with an expected financial return of zero. VICTORY Bonds are a for-profit investment instrument, structured as debt, with a projected 271.8% annual return. While the outcome is profoundly impactful, the vehicle is a financial one designed to attract capital, not donations."
