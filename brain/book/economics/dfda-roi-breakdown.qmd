## The 463:1 Return

We spend **$40 million per year** running the dFDA platform.
It saves the world **$50 billion per year** in clinical trial costs.
That's a **463:1 return on investment**.

Here's how.

## The Math: From $41,000 to $500 Per Patient

Traditional Phase III trials cost **$40,000-120,000 per patient**. Mountains of paperwork. Armies of monitors. Years of delays.

The Oxford RECOVERY trial proved we can do the same thing for **$500 per patient**. They tested COVID treatments on 40,000+ patients by:

- Using existing hospital staff
- Collecting data electronically
- Focusing on what actually matters: does the patient live or die?

The dFDA takes this model global. **80-160x cost reduction**. Same quality data. Better real-world applicability.

## Where the $50 Billion Comes From

Global clinical trial spending: **$100 billion per year** (and growing).

Conservative estimate: dFDA captures 50% efficiency gains across the market.

- 50% of $100B = **$50B saved annually**

Optimistic scenarios show up to 95% cost reduction (like RECOVERY achieved), potentially saving **$95B annually**.

## What $50 Billion Buys You

With the money saved every year, we could:

- Fund **10,000 new trials** (at $5M each using efficient methods)
- Test treatments for **7,000 rare diseases** currently ignored
- Cut drug development time from 17 years to 3-5 years
- Make medicines affordable by eliminating $2.2B development costs

## Daily Opportunity Cost

Every day we don't implement this:

- **$137 million** wasted on inefficient trials
- **2,301 QALYs** lost to delayed treatments
- **Countless patients** denied access to potentially life-saving trials

## The Platform Cost Breakdown

**Annual Operating Costs: ~$40M**

- Cloud infrastructure: $15M
- Engineering team (20 FTEs): $4-6M
- Compliance & security: $1M
- Global integration: $10M
- Ecosystem development: $10M

**Upfront Build Cost: ~$40M** (one-time)

- 2.5 years development
- 75 engineers
- Global infrastructure setup

## ROI Scenarios

| Scenario | Annual Cost | Annual Savings | ROI Ratio | 10-Year NPV |
|----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| Best Case | $11M | $95B | 2,577:1 | $495B |
| Base Case | $40M | $50B | 463:1 | $249B |
| Conservative | $60M | $30B | 250:1 | $190B |
| Worst Case | $270M | $30B | 66:1 | $50B |

Even in the absolute worst case, we get 66x returns.

## Why This Isn't Happening Already

Simple: The people getting rich from the current system aren't the ones paying for it.

- **CROs** make billions from inefficiency
- **Regulators** protect their bureaucratic empires
- **Pharma** passes costs to patients anyway
- **Patients** have no power to change the system

Until now. The dFDA changes the game by aligning incentives: everyone profits from efficiency.

## The Bottom Line

$40 million to save $50 billion.
463:1 ROI.
80x cost reduction per patient.
10,000x more trials possible.

This isn't a moonshot. The RECOVERY trial already proved it works. We just need to scale it globally.

Every day we wait costs $137 million and 2,301 lives.

The math is clear. The technology exists. The only question is whether we have the balls to do it.
