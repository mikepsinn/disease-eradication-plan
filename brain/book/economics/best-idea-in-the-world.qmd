# How to Achieve Infinite Returns (While Also Not Dying)


## The Numbers

### ∞ ROI (Literally Infinite)

The math is third-grade division:

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Annual Benefits}}{\text{New Spending}} = \frac{\$163.6\text{B}}{0} = \infty$$

**Why it's infinite:** The treaty redirects money that's already being spent on killing people to cure them instead. Zero new cost, $163.6B in annual benefits.

### 463:1 Societal ROI

#### Comparison to historical achievements

{{< include ../../figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: 463:1 ROI
- **Smallpox Eradication**: 280:1 ROI (previous record holder)
- **Childhood Vaccines**: 13:1 ROI
- **Average Pharma Drug**: 2:1 ROI

### Saves $6.56 Million Per Life

**The only health intervention that generates wealth:**

- **Malaria Nets**: Cost $3,500 per life saved (excellent charity)
- **Deworming**: Cost $5,500 per life saved (great value)
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: SAVES $6,560,000 per life saved (you read that right)

This is a **dominant intervention** - it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives. No trade-off. No charity needed. Pure profit from preventing death.

## Why Every Other "World-Changing" Idea Is Inferior

### Universal Basic Income

- **Cost**: $3 trillion annually
- **ROI**: Negative (pure expense)
- **Lives saved**: Zero
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: GENERATES $163.6B while saving 25,000 lives

### Mars Colonization

- **Cost**: $500 billion minimum
- **ROI**: Unknown, probably negative for decades
- **Lives saved on Earth**: Zero
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: Pays for itself immediately, helps everyone TODAY

### Climate Technology

- **Cost**: $5-10 trillion needed
- **ROI**: Prevents future losses (important but not profitable)
- **Timeline**: Benefits in 50+ years
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: Profitable year one, compounds forever

### Artificial General Intelligence

- **Cost**: Unknown, potentially infinite
- **Risk**: Might kill everyone
- **Timeline**: Unknown
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: Uses existing tech, zero extinction risk

### Universal Healthcare

- **Cost**: $34 trillion over 10 years (US alone)
- **ROI**: Negative (requires constant funding)
- **1% Treaty/dFDA**: Self-funding through efficiency gains

## The Problem This Solves

### The $119 Trillion Death Machine

Every year humanity wastes:

- **[$2.7 trillion](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)** on weapons (40X more than medical research)
- **$8.2 trillion** treating disease symptoms (not curing them)
- **[$109 trillion](../references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t)** in economic losses from disease burden
- **Total**: $119.8 trillion annually on death and suffering

Meanwhile:

- Medical research: [$68 billion](../references.qmd#global-gov-med-research-spending) (0.057% of the problem)
- Success rate at curing diseases: 0% for 50 years
- Your chance of dying from disease: 100%

{{< include ../../figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-1-percent-treaty-column-chart.qmd >}}

### The Daily Mathematics

![Annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](../../../assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)

**[150,000 people die every day](../references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)** from preventable/curable diseases. That's:

- 50 September 11ths daily
- 18,274 September 11ths annually
- A Holocaust every 40 days

Most species discover medicine before nuclear weapons. Earth did the opposite, which explains the current allocation.

## The Solution That Pays For Itself

### The 3-Part System

{{< include ../../figures/three-ingredients-system-diagram.qmd >}}

1. **The 1% Treaty**: Redirect $27.2B from military budgets (they keep 99%)
2. **DIH Treasury**: Wishocratic governance - 8 billion people allocate funds, not 200 bureaucrats
3. **dFDA Marketplace**: 82x cheaper trials, proven by Oxford

### Why This Actually Works

**🔬 Already Proven**: [Oxford RECOVERY trial](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) achieved 82x cost reduction. Not theoretical - it happened.

**📈 Historical Precedent**: Every military spending cut created economic booms:

- Post-WW2: Cut 30% → Greatest prosperity in history
- Post-Cold War: Cut 3% → Created the internet economy
- Switzerland: 0.7% military → Highest quality of life on Earth

**💰 The Math Is Unbeatable**:

- Cost to implement: $0 (redirected funds)
- Annual benefit: $163.6B
- Lives saved: 25,000 annually
- ROI: ∞ (infinite)

## For Investors: 271.8% Annual Returns Forever

### VICTORY Bonds: The Math Checks Out

{{< include ../../figures/victory-bonds-roi-projection-bar-chart.qmd >}}

#### The Simple Math

- You invest: $1,000
- Annual return: $2,700 (271.8% forever)
- Total available: $1 billion (first-come basis)
- Backed by: $27.2B in treaty funds

#### Better Returns Than

- Medallion Fund: 39% (previous record)
- Warren Buffett: 20%
- Real Estate: 15%
- S&P 500: 10%
- Cocaine Trafficking: 90% (but illegal)
- **VICTORY Bonds: 271.8% (and legal)**

{{< include ../../figures/victory-bonds-money-flow-diagram.qmd >}}

## For Humanity: Your Diseases Actually Get Cured

### What You Get

#### Economic Benefits

- Healthcare costs: $0 (covered by trial participation)
- Insurance premiums: $0 (insurance companies become obsolete)
- Bankruptcy from medical bills: Extinct

#### Health Benefits

- Your cancer: Prevented or cured
- Your aging: Reversed (choose your biological age)
- Your rare disease: Finally profitable to cure
- Your mental illness: Actually fixed, not just numbed
- Your lifespan: +50-100 healthy years

#### Power Benefits

- Direct vote on health spending (real democracy)
- Your proposals compete equally (no gatekeepers)
- Co-creator of humanity's health priorities

## The Strategy: 5 Steps to Victory

1. **Raise $1.0B**: VICTORY bonds at 271.8% returns
2. **Global Referendum**: 280 million votes (just 3.5% of humanity)
3. **Deploy Lobbying**: $1B gets $1.8T in influence (proven ROI)
4. **Fund Politicians**: Super PACs for supporters, replace opponents
5. **Compound Success**: 1% → 2% → 5% → Disease extinct

## Why This Wins (Game Theory)

### Everyone Profits More From Cures Than Disease

**Defense Contractors**: 271.8% returns > 8% margins. They keep 99% of military budget AND get rich.

**Politicians**: You have $1.0B in campaign funds. They like being elected.

**Big Pharma**: Patients PAY THEM for trials instead of pharma paying. From expense to revenue.

**Insurance**: Every cure = billions saved. They're literally betting on you not dying.

**Billionaires**: 271.8% returns make their current wealth look like pocket change.

**You**: Don't die from preventable disease.

## The Choice

### Two Futures, You Pick

- Military spending grows forever
- Disease burden increases
- Economic collapse from healthcare costs

##### Option B: The 1% Treaty

- Save 25,000 lives annually (growing exponentially)
- Generate $163.6B annually
- Cure major diseases within 10 years
- 271.8% returns for investors
- Free healthcare through trials
- Humanity transcends biological limits
