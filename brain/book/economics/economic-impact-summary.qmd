## TL;DR: The Math on Ending War and Disease

Here's what we found when we ran the numbers on the 1% Treaty. All calculations are in our **[Economic Models Jupyter Notebook](./economic_models.ipynb)** if you want to check our work.

*   **The Funding Source (Peace Dividend)**:
    *   **Captured Dividend**: A 1% redirection of global military spending captures **$24.43 billion annually** to fund the initiative.
    *   **Societal Dividend**: This same 1% reduction generates a broader **$91.97 billion in annual economic value** through decreased conflict costs.

*   **The Investment (dFDA Infrastructure)**:
    *   **Total Cost (NPV)**: The total 10-year discounted cost to build and operate the dFDA Infrastructure is **$0.56 billion**.
    *   **Funding Sustainability**: The annual captured dividend of `$24.43B` covers the annual operational cost of `$40M` more than **600 times over**.

*   **The Return (Health & Wealth)**:
    *   **Economic Return (NPV)**: The platform generates a 10-year discounted net benefit of **$268.9 billion** in R&D savings alone.
    *   **Robust ROI**: This yields a rigorous, NPV-based Return on Investment of **481:1**.
    *   **Health Return**: The platform is projected to generate **840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)** annually.

**Bottom Line**: We take 1% of what humanity spends on bombs and use it to cure diseases instead. This creates two massive, independent wins for the world:

1. **The Peace Dividend**: Society gets **$91.97 billion** richer every single year from the economic benefits of slightly less conflict.
2. **The dFDA Bonus**: We use a fraction of that dividend to unlock an *additional* **$50 billion** in R&D savings annually, plus 840,000 years of healthy life.

**Total Annual Benefit: ~$142 Billion per year.**

## The Numbers in Detail

Here are the key metrics from our models. If you want to see exactly how we calculated these, check out the [full analysis](./economic_models.ipynb).

### 1. The Peace Dividend: We Win Even If Nothing Else Works

Here's the beautiful part: even if the dFDA completely failed, the world would still get **$91.97 billion** richer every single year just from a 1% reduction in conflict. This is the "societal dividend."

| How We Fund the dFDA | Annual Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Money we capture** (a portion of the societal dividend) | $24.43 Billion |

This means our "worst case scenario" is that the world gets a ~$92 billion annual peace dividend. Not a bad floor.

### 2. Where We Get the Money

We fund the dFDA by redirecting 1% of what countries spend on weapons.

| Metric | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Annual Cost of War** | `$9.2 Trillion` | The total direct and indirect annual global cost of conflict. |
| **Captured Dividend** | `$24.43 Billion` | 1% of direct military spending, redirected to the DIH treasury. |
| **Societal Dividend** | `$91.97 Billion` | Total annual economic benefit of a 1% reduction in conflict. |

*Even if our estimates are off, the Societal Dividend still ranges from **$41.9B to $200.3B** annually.*

### 3. The dFDA: Where the Money Goes

We use that $24.43 billion to build a platform that makes medical research 80x cheaper.

| Metric | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **NPV of Total Costs (10-yr)** | `$0.560 Billion` | The discounted cost to build and operate the platform for 10 years. |
| **NPV of R&D Savings (10-yr)**| `$269.48 Billion`| The discounted value of a 50% reduction in global trial costs. |
| **Net Benefit (10-yr NPV)** | `$268.92 Billion`| The net economic value created by the investment. |
| **Robust ROI (NPV-based)** | `481:1` | The return generated for every dollar invested, based on the NPV model. |
| **Annual QALYs Gained** | `840,000` | The estimated years of healthy life generated annually. |

*Even in worst-case scenarios, we still get an ROI between **375:1 and 3,500:1**.*

### 4. Can We Afford It?

The $24.43 billion we capture each year covers our $40 million in annual costs 610 times over. We're not going to run out of money.

| Metric | Value | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Funding Coverage Ratio** | `610x` | The annual captured dividend covers the dFDA's annual operational costs more than 600 times over. |

## 5. How Does This Compare to Other Ways to Save Lives?

Let's compare this to the most effective charities in the world (like those GiveWell recommends).

| Intervention | Cost to Achieve Outcome | Our Initiative's Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GiveWell Top Charities** (e.g., Against Malaria Foundation) | Spend **~$3,000 - $5,000** to save one life. | Generate **840,000 QALYs** annually while creating **$268.9 Billion** in net economic value. |

**The Difference**: GiveWell's top charities are the best ways to spend money to save lives. They cost money but save lives very efficiently.

Our plan doesn't cost money, it *makes* money while saving lives. Instead of asking people to donate, we make everyone richer while curing diseases. That's why the math looks so different.

## 6. How Does This Compare to the Best Public Health Wins in History?

Here's how our plan stacks up against the most successful health interventions ever, the ones that actually saved money while saving lives.

| Intervention | How it Creates Value | Scale of Annual Net Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Childhood Vaccinations** | Prevents immense long-term treatment costs for diseases like measles and polio for a very low upfront cost. | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Smoking Cessation** | Prevents a wide range of incredibly expensive chronic diseases (cancer, heart disease) through low-cost interventions. | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Water Fluoridation** | Avoids significant dental care costs for entire populations at a negligible cost per person. | Hundreds of Millions to Billions |
| **1% Treaty (Peace Dividend)** | Reduces global conflict costs by 1%, creating a massive societal economic benefit from decreased destruction and instability. | **~$97 Billion, Annually** |
| **dFDA (R&D Efficiency)** | Uses a fraction of the Peace Dividend to fund a system that makes clinical research ~80x more efficient, unlocking huge R&D savings. | **~$50 Billion, Annually** |

**Why This Is Different:**

Vaccines and smoking cessation programs are amazing, they solve specific problems with a high return.

The 1% Treaty and dFDA initiative tackles two problems at once:

1.  **The Peace Dividend** is a massive economic gain on par with the largest public health wins, created simply by reducing a global negative (conflict).
2.  **The dFDA** then uses a tiny fraction of that gain to fix the *system* of medical research, generating a *second* massive win that also has an unprecedented ROI.

Instead of solving one problem, we use a global-scale win to fund a system-scale win. When you use the world's largest source of waste to fund its most impactful opportunity, the math gets pretty wild.

## The Economics

### Return on Investment

**463:1 ROI (Better Than Smallpox Eradication)**

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves a **463:1 return on investment**.
This means for every $1 invested, we society get $463 in benefits.

This exceptional ROI comes from multiple sources:
- **$50B in annual R&D cost savings**: 82X reduction in clinical trial costs
- **Faster access to new treatments**: 2 years instead of 17 years to market
- **Better prevention through real-world data**: Continuous learning from millions of patients
- **Enabling new therapies**: Making rare disease trials economically viable

{{< include ../../figures/dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

This ROI is better than history's greatest public health achievements like smallpox eradication (280:1) and childhood vaccinations (13:1).

### ROI With 1% Treaty Funding

**Infinite ROI (Self-Funding System)**

{{< include ../../figures/treaty-dih-dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

But here's the real magic: when funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**.

**Why the ROI is literally infinite** ([see full calculation](brain/book/economics/icer-full-calculation.qmd)):
- **Zero net cost**: The $27B comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **$147.1B in annual benefits**: Peace dividend ($97.1B) + R&D savings ($50B)
- **Operating costs**: Only $290M/year (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: 25,000/year (875,000 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **The math**: $147B benefit ÷ $0 new spending = ∞ (infinite ROI)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS $167,771 instead of spending

This is a **dominant health intervention**.
This means it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives.
Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates $147 billion annually while saving 25,000 lives.

### Total Annual Benefit

**10X Bigger Than History's Best to Public Health Victories**

{{< include ../../figures/public-health-impact-horizontal-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The $147.1 billion annual economic benefit makes this intervention nearly **10× larger than childhood vaccinations** (one of the most successful public health programs in history).
The stacked bar shows how both the peace dividend ($97.1B) and dFDA R&D savings ($50B) contribute to this unprecedented scale.

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors 270% annual returns.

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend $3,500-5,500 to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society $5.87 million per life saved**.
