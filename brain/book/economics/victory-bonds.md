## 1. Executive Summary: The Investment Case

This is a political arbitrage investment. We are raising **$1.2–2.5 billion** to fund a targeted lobbying and public relations campaign to pass the **1% Treaty.**

The treaty redirects **$27 billion per year** of guaranteed, recurring global government spending from military budgets to our treasury. Bondholders are repaid directly from this captured revenue stream.

The core thesis is simple: we are using the proven, high-leverage playbook of defense contractors—who turn [$14 million in lobbying into $70.8 billion in contracts](../references.md#military-lobbying-returns)—to generate a multi-thousand-percent return for a better purpose.

## 2. The Instrument: How VICTORY Bonds Work

Think of War Bonds from WWII, but for curing disease instead of winning wars. VICTORY Bonds work like a simple loan: You give us money now, we pay you back with big returns later.

**We're targeting 40% annual returns (28x your money in 10 years).** That beats most hedge funds.

**Two simple rules:**
1. Early investors get ~28x their money back over 10 years.
2. We always keep at least 50% of income for actually curing diseases.

**Here's how it works:** You loan us money to pass the 1% Treaty. Once the treaty passes, we pay you back from the money it redirects. Simple as that.

### Key Financial Terms
| Term | Details |
|---|---|
| **Instrument Type** | Debt Instrument (Senior Unsecured) |
| **Total Raise** | $1.2–2.5 Billion (in tranches) |
| **Target CAGR** | ~40% (approx. 28x MOIC over 10 years) |
| **Maturity** | 10 years |
| **Coupon Rate** | Variable; paid from treaty inflows |
| **Payout Source** | Direct distributions from the DIH Treasury, funded by the 1% Treaty on global military spending. |
| **Seniority** | Program Senior. Bondholders are senior creditors for all revenue generated from the 1% Treaty, ensuring they are among the first to be repaid. |
| **Collateral** | The 1% Treaty revenue stream itself. |

### Investment Timeline & Returns

- **Total Implementation Cost:** $1.2-2.5B over 36 months
**What This Buys:**
- Global referendum "Proof-of-Vote" points platform (~$5-10M)
- Independent expenditures in priority elections (~$800M-1.5B)
- Targeted legal bribes to co-opt the MIC (~$100-200M)
- Building the system and testing it (~$250-400M)
- Staying out of prison and writing the treaty (~$100-200M)
- **Annual Returns Once Operational:** $27B+ per year from 1% military budget redirections
- **ROI Timeline:** 18-36 months after first treaty ratification

**Break-even Analysis:** Even in a conservative partial success scenario where only the **US, EU, & UK** participate (generating **$13B annually**), the system generates a **cash payout of $6.5B (2.6X the initial $2.5B investment)** in the first year of operation alone.

## 3. Why This Beats Every Other Investment

Here's why this works better than anything else you can invest in:

- **We're Using the Defense Contractors' Playbook**: They spend [$14 million on lobbying to get $70.8 billion in contracts](../references.md#military-lobbying-returns)—that's a 5,000% return. We're doing the exact same thing, except for curing disease instead of building bombs.
- **We're Tapping Government Money**: Instead of hoping some startup makes money, we're redirecting money that governments already spend. 1% of defense budgets is guaranteed, stable, and recurring.
- **We Cut Costs by 80x**: The [Oxford RECOVERY trial](../reference/recovery-trial.md) proved we can run trials for $500 instead of $41,000 per patient. That's real. That's proven. That's an 80x cost reduction.
- **We Don't Depend on the Stock Market**: Our returns come from political adoption, not whether the market goes up or down.
- **We Win Even if We Partially Fail**: If only the US, EU, and UK join, we still generate $13B annually. That's still a massive win.

## 4. What Could Go Wrong (And How We Handle It)

- **What if the treaty doesn't pass?**
  - We use prediction markets to track our chances in real time. We only spend the big money after we hit 3.5% public support. If we fail, you get paid based on how far we got.
- **What if we screw up the execution?**
  - The 80x efficiency isn't a guess—Oxford already proved it works with the RECOVERY trial. We're copying something that already exists.
- **What if we can't raise enough money?**
  - Smart contracts hold your money in escrow. If we don't hit our fundraising targets, you automatically get your money back.
- **What if this gets us in legal trouble?**
  - We're following securities laws (Reg A, Reg S, etc.). We've got lawyers making sure we stay out of prison.

## 5. We Show You Everything

We know you don't trust anyone with your money. So we're making everything visible.

- **Smart Contract Escrow:** Your money sits in a smart contract until we hit our targets. If we don't, you get it back automatically. No "trust us" required.
- **Public Money Dashboard:** Every dollar in, every dollar out. You can watch our treasury in real time, 24/7, on a public website.
- **Independent Audits:** We get audited by real accountants and publish the results. No hiding behind "proprietary information."
