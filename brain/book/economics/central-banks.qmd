# How Central Banks Fund Your Death (The War Machine's ATM)

Every dollar in your wallet is a death certificate with a president's face on it.

I know that sounds dramatic. But let me show you something beautiful about the relationship between money printing and murder.

## The Problem: Every Fiat Currency in History Has Been Devalued To Fund Unpopular Wars

Here's a fun historical pattern that definitely won't repeat itself (it will):

**Ancient Rome (3rd Century):**

- Started war with Persia
- Ran out of gold
- Debased currency from 95% silver to 5%
- Inflation destroyed the empire
- Everyone died badly

**Revolutionary France (1790s):**

- Started wars with everyone
- Ran out of money
- Printed "assignats" backed by stolen church land
- Hyperinflation: 13,000% in 5 years
- Napoleon happened (not great)

**Weimar Germany (1920s):**

- Lost World War I
- Printed money to pay reparations
- Hyperinflation: 29,500% per month
- People burned money for heat
- Hitler happened (really not great)

**United States (1917-present):**

- Created Federal Reserve (1913)
- Immediately funded World War I (1917)
- Dollar lost 96% of value since
- Wars now continuous and everywhere
- You're living it (how's that working out?)

The pattern is so consistent it's basically a law of physics: Give politicians a money printer, they'll use it to fund wars the public won't pay for with taxes.

## 1972: When Nixon Weaponized Money Against You

August 15, 1971. A day that will live in monetary infamy.

Nixon went on TV and said, "Hey, remember how dollars could be exchanged for gold? Yeah, we're not doing that anymore. Also, wage and price controls. Also, import taxes. Also, screw you."

**Why He Really Did It:**

- Vietnam War was bleeding money
- France wanted their gold back (party poopers)
- Couldn't raise taxes (people riot)
- Solution: Print money forever!

**What Actually Happened:**

- Gold standard: Dead
- Dollar backing: "Trust us bro"
- Inflation: To the moon
- Your savings: Slowly murdered

**The Beautiful Theft That Followed:**

Since 1972:

- Productivity up: 246%
- Wages up: 115%
- The difference: [They stole it](../references.qmd#productivity-wage-gap)

Where'd the money go? Three guesses:

1. Wall Street (correct!)
2. War contractors (also correct!)
3. You (BZZT! Wrong! Thanks for playing!)

## The Cantillon Effect: Why You're Poor and Raytheon Isn't

Here's how the scam works:

**Step 1: Fed Prints Money**

- Creates dollars from nothing
- Gives to big banks at 0% interest
- You don't get any (sad trombone)

**Step 2: Banks Get Rich**

- Banks get new money first
- Buy assets while prices still low
- Your rent goes up immediately

**Step 3: Government Spends**

- Borrows freshly printed money
- Buys missiles and bombs
- Defense contractors get paid

**Step 4: You Get Screwed**

- Inflation hits your groceries
- Your savings lose value
- Your wages stay flat
- You blame immigrants (they want this)

It's called the Cantillon Effect after Richard Cantillon, who figured this out in the 1700s. We've known about this scam for 300 years. We keep falling for it.

## The Federal Reserve: A Private Corporation That Owns You

Fun fact: The Federal Reserve isn't federal and has no reserves.

It's actually:

- A private corporation
- Owned by member banks
- Run by 12 unelected people
- Never been fully audited
- More powerful than Congress

**What They Actually Do:**

1. **Print Money for Wars**
   - Iraq/Afghanistan: [$8 trillion printed](../references.qmd#war-costs-watson)
   - Ukraine: $113 billion and counting
   - Next war: Already funded in advance

2. **Bail Out Their Friends**
   - 2008: $700 billion to banks
   - 2020: $4 trillion to everyone (except you)
   - 2023: $300 billion to failed banks again
   - Your mortgage: Still not forgiven

3. **Destroy Your Purchasing Power**
   - Inflation "target": 2% (your money half gone in 35 years)
   - Actual inflation: Way higher (check your grocery bill)
   - Real inflation: Everything you need costs more

4. **Hide the Evidence**
   - No full audit allowed
   - Meeting minutes released after 5 years
   - Real decisions made at dinner parties
   - You'll never know what they're really doing

## Every War Since 1972: Funded by Destroying Your Savings

Let's do the math on how much your money has funded murder:

**Vietnam War Extension (1972-1975):**

- Cost: $168 billion (inflation adjusted)
- Funded by: Money printing
- Your loss: 30% purchasing power

**Gulf War (1991):**

- Cost: $102 billion
- Funded by: Money printing
- Your loss: Gas prices doubled

**Iraq War (2003-2011):**

- Cost: $2 trillion
- Funded by: Money printing
- Your loss: House prices went insane

**Afghanistan (2001-2021):**

- Cost: $2.3 trillion
- Funded by: Money printing
- Your loss: Can't afford anything

**The Running Total:**

- Wars funded by printing: $8+ trillion
- Medical research in same period: $680 billion
- Ratio: 12:1 for death over life
- Your real wage growth: Negative

## The $300 Billion Annual Bank Subsidy (Your Money)

Here's a fun game: The Fed pays banks interest on reserves.

**The Scam:**

- Banks park money at Fed
- Fed pays them 5.5% interest
- That's $300 billion per year
- From taxpayers to banks
- For doing literally nothing

**What $300 Billion Could Buy Instead:**

- Cure cancer (probably)
- End homelessness (definitely)
- Fix all infrastructure (easily)
- Feed everyone (with money left over)
- But no, banks need it for bonuses

## Why We Can't Reform the Fed (It's Terminal)

**The Problem with Reform:**

1. **Regulatory Capture**
   - Fed officials → Wall Street jobs
   - Wall Street executives → Fed board
   - Same people, different chairs
   - Musical chairs for millionaires

2. **Political Capture**
   - Politicians need Fed to fund deficits
   - Fed needs politicians for protection
   - Perfect corrupt symbiosis
   - You're not in the loop

3. **Systemic Lock-In**
   - Dollar is global reserve currency
   - Requires infinite military to maintain
   - Military requires infinite dollars
   - Ouroboros of death

4. **Too Many Depend on the Scam**
   - Banks need free money
   - Government needs war funding
   - Contractors need contracts
   - Everyone important wins (you're not important)

**The Only Solution: Bypass It Entirely**

We can't fix the Fed. It's like trying to reform cancer. You don't reform cancer. You cut it out or route around it.

## Why "Just Fund Medical Research More" Is a Lie

"Why not just ask for donations? Why not just increase the NIH budget? Why tie it to military spending?"

Because money isn't real. Resources are.

### The Fixed Pie of Human Genius

Earth has:

- 8 billion brains (fixed quantity)
- 24 hours per day per brain (physics won't negotiate)
- Limited raw materials (can't print titanium)
- Finite factory capacity (can't build infinite labs)

When a brilliant engineer designs missiles, they're NOT designing medical devices. When a factory builds tanks, it's NOT building MRI machines. When a PhD researches weapons, they're NOT researching cures.

**The Resource Reality:**

- Top 10% of human talent: ~800 million people
- Currently building weapons: ~40 million
- Currently curing disease: ~1 million
- The ratio: 40:1 for death over life

You can print infinite dollars. You can't print more geniuses.

### The Inflation Shell Game (How They Steal Medical Progress)

Watch this magic trick:

**Year 1:** 

- NIH budget: $40 billion
- Military budget: $800 billion
- Ratio: 20:1 for death

**Year 5 (after "increasing medical research"):**

- NIH budget: $60 billion (50% increase! Victory!)
- Military budget: $1.2 trillion (also 50% increase)
- Fed money printing: 50% inflation
- Real purchasing power: Exactly the same
- Ratio: Still 20:1 for death

You got a `{python} format_percentage(TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_PCT)` raise! Too bad everything costs `{python} format_percentage(TRIAL_COST_REDUCTION_PCT)` more. The pie didn't grow. They just cut it with more decimal places.

### The Proof: 50 Years of Going Nowhere

**Medical Research as % of GDP:**

- 1975: 0.08%
- 1985: 0.07%
- 1995: 0.07%
- 2005: 0.06%
- 2015: 0.06%
- 2025: 0.065%

Absolute dollars increased 10X. Percentage of resources: Actually decreased. This is not an accident.

**What Actually Grew:**

- Financial sector: 3% → 8% of GDP
- Military-industrial: 4% → 6% of GDP  
- Healthcare bureaucracy: 5% → 18% of GDP
- Actual medical research: Shrinking slice

The money printers fund what they value. They value control, not cures.

### Why Money Printing Matters: Resources Follow the Printer

Here's the trick they don't want you to understand:

**When the Fed prints $1 trillion for war:**

1. Defense contractors get it first (Cantillon Effect)
2. They immediately buy up: Engineers, Scientists, Factories, Raw materials
3. Prices rise for everyone else
4. Medical researchers can't compete
5. The best minds go where the money is

**The Brain Drain Math:**

- MIT graduate with $200k debt
- Option A: NIH postdoc at $55k/year
- Option B: Raytheon at $150k/year
- Choice: Obvious
- Result: Another brain lost to the death machine

This is why printing more money for medicine doesn't work. The Fed will just print more for war, bid up the same resources, and maintain the same deadly ratio.

**The Only Solution:** Change the ratio itself. Take from war. Give to life. Same pie, different slices.

## The 1% Solution: Redirecting the Death Printer to Life

Here's the beautiful jujitsu move: They're already printing trillions for war. The treaty asks them to point 1% of it at healing instead.

**The Current Money Flow:**

- Fed prints $8 trillion
- Goes to defense contractors
- Builds bombs and missiles
- People die
- Your savings devalued
- Repeat forever

**The 1% Treaty Redirect:**

- Fed still prints money (they can't help themselves)
- 1% goes to DIH instead of bombs
- Funds 54 million patient trials
- People live
- Your savings still devalued (but at least people get cured)
- Civilization advances

**The Genius of This Approach:**

1. **The Treaty Doesn't Ask for New Money**
   - They're already printing it
   - The treaty redirects 1%
   - Like a river changing course by 1 degree
   - Same money printer, different output

2. **Path of Least Resistance**
   - Easier than stopping money printing (impossible)
   - Easier than raising taxes (political suicide)
   - Easier than cutting military spending (lobbyists cry)
   - Just redirect existing flow

3. **The Money is Already Fake**
   - It's created from nothing anyway
   - Might as well create health instead of death
   - Same inflation, better outcomes
   - Your purchasing power dies either way (but you might live)

4. **VICTORY Bonds: The Bootstrap**
   - Initial funding to pass the treaty
   - Once treaty passes, bonds paid from redirected funds
   - Not competing with Fed, just redirecting its output
   - Like a dam redirecting a river

## The Historical Precedent: When Markets Funded Victory

**World War II War Bonds:**

- Raised $185 billion (1940s dollars)
- Voluntary purchases
- Defeated fascism
- No hyperinflation
- Democracy saved

**The Difference:**

- They funded necessary defense
- VICTORY Bonds fund necessary cures
- They saved democracy from fascism
- VICTORY Bonds save humanity from disease

Both use markets instead of money printing. Both align incentives with outcomes. Both actually work.

## The Choice: Keep Printing Death or Start Printing Life

**Option A: Keep the Current System**

- Fed prints $8 trillion for war
- Your money becomes worthless
- 55 million die from disease annually
- Defense contractors get richer
- Repeat until extinction

**Option B: The 1% Redirect**

- Fed still prints $8 trillion (they're addicted)
- 1% ($80 billion) goes to curing disease
- Your money still becomes worthless (sorry)
- But millions fewer people die
- Maybe your cancer gets cured before you need it

It's not complicated. They're going to print money anyway. We're just asking them to print 1% for life instead of 100% for death.

**How Tiny 1% Really Is:**

- Fed printed $4 trillion in 2020 alone (for COVID)
- 1% of that = $40 billion = curing multiple diseases
- They increase money supply by 7% annually anyway
- The treaty asks for 1/7th of one year's new fake money
- It's a rounding error in their death budget

**Why This Can Actually Happen:**

- Defense contractors keep 99% (they stop complaining)
- Politicians get credit for "supporting healthcare" 
- No new taxes needed (already printing)
- Fed keeps printing (their favorite activity)
- Everyone wins except disease and death

**The Beautiful Irony:**

They created the money printer to fund death without asking permission. We're using their own system against them - redirecting their death machine to create life. It's like convincing a dragon to breathe medicine instead of fire.

## Your Money, Your Choice

Every dollar in your wallet was printed to fund something.

Right now, it funded:

- Bombs (definitely)
- Banks (absolutely)
- Bureaucrats (unfortunately)
- Your health (HAHAHAHA no)

With VICTORY bonds, your money funds:

- Cures (directly)
- Returns (40% target)
- Your future (literally)
- Everyone's health (including yours)

The Fed isn't going away. The treaty isn't ending central banking. It's just building something better alongside it.

Let them print money for war. Use markets for peace.

Let them devalue currency for death. Create value from life.

Let them steal through inflation. Build through innovation.

*P.S. - The Fed has entered the chat. They want you to know that inflation is "transitory" and war is "necessary for stability." They also have a bridge to sell you. It's in Brooklyn. Very nice. Trust them.*
