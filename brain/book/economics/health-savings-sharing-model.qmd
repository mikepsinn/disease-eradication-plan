# The 50/50 Health Savings Split: Making Cures More Profitable Than Treatments

Pharmaceutical companies aren't evil. They're just following incentives. Right now, the incentives say: "Keep people sick forever, bill monthly."

This chapter explains how to change those incentives so curing you becomes more profitable than milking you like a diseased cash cow until you die.

## The Problem: Your Disease Is Their Annuity

Here's how pharma currently makes money:

### Diabetes

- Treatment cost: $500/month forever
- Patient lifespan with disease: 30 years
- Total revenue per patient: $180,000
- Number of patients: 37 million (US alone)
- Total addressable market: $6.66 trillion

#### A Cure Would Be Worth

- One-time payment: Maybe $10,000
- Lost future revenue: $170,000 per patient
- CEO's reaction: "Fire whoever suggested this"

This is why we've cured exactly zero chronic diseases since Hepatitis C in 2014. It's not a conspiracy. It's math.

## The Solution: Split the Savings

Here's the simple fix: When a company cures a disease, they get 50.0% of the healthcare costs that would have been spent treating it.

### The New Math

- Healthcare system saves: $180,000 per diabetic
- Pharma company gets: $90,000 per cure
- Patient pays: $0-1,000 (covered by insurance)
- Everyone wins except: The disease

## How It Works

### Step 1: Calculate the True Cost of Disease

Every disease has a lifetime price tag:

| Disease | Average Lifetime Cost | Annual Deaths | Total Market |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|--------------|
| Heart Disease | $750,000 | 695,000 | $521B |
| Cancer | $450,000 | 609,000 | $274B |
| Alzheimer's | $580,000 | 120,000 | $70B |
| Diabetes | $180,000 | 102,000 | $18B |
| **Total Top 4** | **$490,000 avg** | **1.5M** | **$883B** |

These aren't treatment costs. These are total economic costs: Healthcare, lost productivity, family burden, everything.

### Step 2: Offer Half to Whoever Cures It

Simple contract:

- Cure the disease
- The system pays 50% of savings
- Payment over 10-20 years as savings materialize
- Verified by actual healthcare spending data

### Step 3: Watch Capitalism Do Its Thing

#### Before

- Diabetes treatment market: $500/month × 37M people = $222B/year
- Incentive: Keep everyone diabetic forever

#### After

- Diabetes cure market: $90,000 × 37M people = $3.33 trillion
- Incentive: Cure everyone immediately

Suddenly, curing diabetes is worth 15X more than treating it.

## Real-World Example: The Cancer Math

Let's say Pfizer develops a universal cancer cure tomorrow.

### Current Cancer Treatment Market

- Annual revenue: $200 billion
- Growth rate: 7% annually
- 30-year NPV: $4.2 trillion

**50/50 Cure Payment Model:**

- Lives saved: 10 million annually
- Cost saved per life: $450,000
- Pfizer's share: $225,000 per cure
- Annual payment: $2.25 trillion
- 10-year total: $22.5 trillion

**The CEO's Reaction:** "CURE EVERYTHING. NOW."

## Why Healthcare Systems Would Pay

"But wait," you say, "why would insurance companies pay trillions for cures?"

Because they're already paying more for treatments:

### Insurance Company Perspective

- Current: Pay $750,000 per heart disease patient
- With cure: Pay $375,000 once
- Savings: $375,000 per patient
- ROI: Instant 50% return

It's like buying something at half price. You'd be stupid not to.

## The Preventative Medicine Bonus

This model works even better for prevention:

### Longevity Therapy Example

- Delays aging by 10 years
- Reduces annual healthcare costs by $5,000/person
- 30-year savings: $150,000
- Developer payment: $75,000 per person
- Global market: 8 billion × $75,000 = $600 trillion

Suddenly, keeping people healthy becomes the world's most valuable business.

## How to Calculate Savings (The Non-Scammy Way)

### For Specific Disease Cures

1. Historical data: Average treatment cost for disease
2. Multiply by: Number of patients who would have gotten it
3. Subtract: Cost of cure delivery
4. Split: 50/50

### For Preventative Treatments

1. Baseline: Current per-capita healthcare spending by age
2. Treatment group: Actual spending after intervention
3. Difference: The savings
4. Split: 50/50

### For Longevity Treatments

1. Compare: Treated vs untreated population health costs
2. Adjust for: Demographics and other factors
3. Calculate: Net reduction in spending
4. Split: 50/50

All verified by actual claims data. No estimates. No projections. Just math.

## The Incentive Cascade

Once one company succeeds:

**Year 1:** First diabetes cure, $3.3 trillion market created
**Year 2:** Every pharma company pivots to cures
**Year 3:** Heart disease cured
**Year 5:** Cancer eliminated
**Year 10:** Aging significantly slowed
**Year 20:** Death becomes mostly optional

Each success makes the next one more inevitable. It's a greed avalanche in the right direction.

## Objections from People Who Profit from Disease

**"But pharma companies need recurring revenue!"**

- They'll get it from the 50% payments over 10-20 years
- Plus new diseases will always emerge (thanks, evolution)
- Plus aging creates infinite demand

**"This would bankrupt healthcare systems!"**

- They're already bankrupt from paying for treatments
- This cuts their costs in half
- Bankruptcy from success > bankruptcy from failure

**"How do we verify the savings?"**

- Every insurance claim is digital
- Match treated patients vs statistical controls
- Blockchain for transparency
- Fraud = lose all future payments

**"What about rare diseases?"**

- Pool them together
- Same 50/50 split on aggregate savings
- Suddenly profitable to cure diseases affecting 12 people

## Implementation: Surprisingly Easy

**Step 1:** Pass legislation allowing 50/50 contracts
**Step 2:** Let insurance companies offer them
**Step 3:** Watch pharma companies compete to cure everything
**Step 4:** Try not to die before your disease gets cured

No new bureaucracy. No government funding. Just changing what we pay for.

## The Global Impact

If implemented worldwide:

- Healthcare costs: Drop 50-75% within 20 years
- Human lifespan: Increase 20-40 years
- Economic productivity: Massive increase from healthy population
- Pharma profits: Higher than ever (but from cures, not suffering)

## Why This Isn't Already Happening

Simple: Nobody's incentivized to change the system.

- Politicians: Get donations from treatment companies
- Regulators: Revolving door with industry
- Insurance: Can always raise premiums
- Pharma: Making bank on suffering
- Patients: Too sick to organize

But the math is undeniable. The first country to implement this wins the future.

## The Solution

We don't need to make pharmaceutical companies moral. We just need to make curing diseases more profitable than treating them.

50/50 savings split does exactly that.

Your diabetes: Worth $180,000 as a lifelong disease
Your diabetes cure: Worth $90,000 in shared savings
Pharma's choice: Obvious

The only question is whether we implement this before or after you die from something curable.

*P.S. - Every pharmaceutical executive reading this is doing math right now. The smart ones are pivoting to cures. The others will be bankrupt within a decade. Greed finds a way.*
