# Fundraising & Budget Plan: The Activation Energy

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the total capital required to successfully implement the 1% Treaty and establish the Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH). It is a supporting document for the overall strategy. The figures presented here are the basis for our **$1.2B - $2.5B total fundraising goal**.

## 1. Executive Summary: The "Activation Energy"

The capital raised is not for ongoing operations; it is a one-time "activation energy" required to overcome the political inertia of the current system. This investment is designed to unlock a perpetual, multi-generational funding stream of **$27+ billion annually** for global health.

**Note on Diligence Documents:** This document provides the high-level strategic budget. A detailed, bottom-up operational budget and a description of our full, spreadsheet-based financial model are available in our [Operational Budget & Financial Model Documentation](/brain/book/economics/financial-plan.qmd).

The budget is structured around a 36-month timeline and is divided into four primary operational categories.

## 2. Total Fundraising Requirement: $1.2B - $2.5B

The range reflects the variable nature of political campaigns and the potential to scale our efforts. A smaller, more targeted raise of $1.2B is considered the minimum viable amount, while a $2.5B raise would allow for a massively parallel, global campaign with a significantly higher probability of success.

### Multi-Phase Fundraising Strategy

The raise will be conducted in tranches, with each tranche tied to the achievement of specific, verifiable milestones.

1.  **Phase 1: Seed Round ($250M - $400M)**

    - **Goal:** To fund the development of the global referendum platform, establish the legal frameworks in pilot countries, and run the first electoral cycle interventions.
    - **Milestone to Unlock Phase 2:** Secure 50 million verified referendum participants and/or secure a pro-treaty legislative majority in a pilot G20 nation.

2.  **Phase 2: Series A ($500M - $1B)**

    - **Goal:** To expand political operations to all G7 nations and achieve the 3.5% global participation threshold (280 million people).
    - **Milestone to Unlock Phase 3:** Achieve the 3.5% threshold and/or secure the first national treaty commitment from a G7 nation.

3.  **Phase 3: Growth Round ($500M - $1.1B)**

    - **Goal:** To ensure treaty ratification in all major powers (US, EU, China) and fully capitalize the DIH treasury for its first year of operation.
    - **Milestone:** Full operational deployment and the first $1B disbursement.

## 3. Phased Operational Budget & Justification

The budget is not a monolithic block but is designed to be deployed in phases, directly corresponding to our fundraising tranches. This ensures that capital is used efficiently and that spending scales only with the achievement of verifiable milestones.

# Fundraising Strategy: Simple Targets, Sophisticated Mechanics

## Executive Summary

To secure the **\$1.2–\$2.5 billion** in "activation energy" required to pass the 1% Treaty, we employ a sophisticated, multi-phase fundraising strategy. This strategy is designed to maximize the speed of capital acquisition while ensuring capital efficiency and minimizing risk for early investors.

Our approach is built on three pillars:

1.  **A Hybrid Communication Strategy:** Using simple, ambitious ROI targets for marketing to create broad appeal, while using efficient market-driven mechanisms on the backend.
2.  **De-Risking with Assurance Contracts:** Eliminating fundraising risk for early backers through a transparent, smart contract-based "money-back guarantee."
3.  **A Phased, Market-Driven Model:** Progressively de-risking the project and allowing the market to price risk and reward efficiently over time.

## The Hybrid Communication Strategy

Investor psychology requires a simple, powerful message. The underlying financial mechanics require efficiency. We achieve both.

- **Public-Facing Target (The "Hook"):** For marketing and high-level communications, we will lead with a simple, audacious, and mathematically defensible target:

  > **"We are targeting returns superior to the world's most elite hedge funds (~40% annualized), which projects to a ~28x return over 10 years. Our financial model is governed by a simple principle: investor payouts never exceed 50% of our income, guaranteeing our mission is always protected."**

  This message is designed to be memorable, signal the massive scale of the opportunity, and is credibly backed by our [Investment Thesis](/brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) and [Dynamic Cash Flow Model](/brain/book/economics/financial-plan.qmd).

- **Backend Mechanism (The "Engine"):** For financial structuring and sales to sophisticated investors, we will use efficient market mechanisms like **Dutch Auctions** for public funding tranches. This allows the market to perform price discovery, ensuring we secure capital at the lowest possible cost (i.e., the lowest acceptable ROI for investors), thus maximizing the funds left for the DIH treasury.

## De-Risking Early Investment with Assurance Contracts

The primary risk for an early investor is the collective action problem: "What if not enough other people invest?" We eliminate this risk entirely using **Assurance Contracts**.

- **Mechanism:** All initial funds will be deposited into a secure, transparent smart contract escrow. These funds are locked and cannot be accessed by the project team.
- **The Guarantee:** The smart contract has a pre-defined funding goal (e.g., \$250 million) and a deadline (e.g., 12 months).
- If the goal **is met** by the deadline, the funds are released to the project treasury.
- If the goal **is not met**, the funds are automatically and trustlessly returned to every single investor.
- **Net Benefit:** This "money-back guarantee" removes all fundraising risk for our backers, creating powerful social proof and encouraging faster, more confident commitments. We may also implement a **Dominant Assurance Contract (DAC)** model, where a patron offers a small bonus (e.g., extra governance tokens) to all participants if the goal is met, further incentivizing early support.

## Phased Fundraising Model

Our fundraising will occur in stages, aligning with project milestones to progressively de-risk the investment.

1.  **Seed Round:** The initial tranche ($250M–$400M) will be raised from strategic partners with fixed, highly attractive terms, secured by the assurance contract.
2.  **Public Sales:** Subsequent tranches will be sold via public offerings (e.g., Dutch auctions), allowing the market to price the instruments based on the project's progress and reduced risk profile.

## DIH Treasury Cash Flow Model

### The Beautiful Machine That Turns Murder Money Into Medicine

Here's how $27 billion flows from bombs to bandages without getting stolen by middlemen.

**Year 1: The Money Lands (And Nobody Dies)**

Every January 1st, $27 billion arrives in the DIH treasury from 100+ nations. This is 1% of their [$2.72 trillion murder budget](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending). They still have 99% left to build death robots. Everyone's happy.

But here's the revolutionary part: We don't split it by disease. We don't create committees. We don't play favorites.

**The Beautiful Simplicity:**

Every patient gets an equal subsidy. Period.

No cancer lobby demanding more than rare diseases. No mental health getting shortchanged because it's not sexy. No committees deciding your disease doesn't matter.

Just pure market democracy: Patients choose trials, subsidies follow patients.

### The Dynamic Subsidy Machine (Capitalism, But Good)

Here's the genius part: We don't pay researchers. We subsidize patients. Why? Because patients can't steal their own subsidies.

**How Normal Grants Work (Stupid):**
1. Researcher writes 300-page grant proposal (6 months wasted)
2. Committee of 12 people pretends to understand it (they don't)
3. Money goes to university, takes 40% for "overhead" (new gym)
4. Researcher spends it on conferences in Hawaii (nice tan)
5. Maybe does some science (if there's time)
6. Patient dies waiting (definitely no time)

**How DIH Subsidies Work (Smart):**
1. Patient has disease (unfortunate but real)
2. Researcher posts trial on dFDA marketplace (like eBay for cures)
3. Patient sees trial, wants to join (hope appears)
4. DIH covers costs automatically (no forms, no committees)
5. Patient pays $20-50 copay (skin in the game)
6. Data flows back immediately (science happens)
7. Patient maybe lives (better odds than before)

**The Math That Makes Everyone Rich:**

```
Base Subsidy = Total Treasury ÷ Active Trial Participants

Example with 1 million participants:
$27 billion ÷ 1 million = $27,000 per patient per year

As more patients join:
5 million participants = $5,400 per patient per year
10 million participants = $2,700 per patient per year
```

This creates beautiful incentives:
- Patients organize to grow the treasury (2% treaty = double subsidies)
- Researchers compete to attract patients (better trials win)
- Insurance companies save money (trials cheaper than long-term care)
- Everyone wants more people in trials (network effects)

### The Compound Interest of Not Dying

**Year 1-3: Building Phase**
- Treasury: $27B annually
- Patients covered: 1-5 million
- Treatments tested: 10,000+
- First cures emerge
- Media goes crazy
- Politicians claim credit

**Year 4-7: Acceleration Phase**
- Success stories multiply
- Public demands 2% treaty (doubles to $54B)
- Patients covered: 10-20 million
- Treatments tested: 100,000+
- Major diseases start falling
- Pharma pivots to trial fees instead of drug monopolies
- Insurance companies become zealous supporters

**Year 8-10: Exponential Phase**
- 5% treaty passes ($135B annually)
- Patients covered: 50+ million
- Treatments tested: 1 million+
- Rare diseases get equal attention
- Life expectancy jumps 5-10 years
- Military contractors now make medical devices
- War becomes unprofitable

**Year 10+: Victory Condition**
- 10%+ treaties standard ($270B+ annually)
- Disease becomes optional inconvenience
- Aging significantly slowed
- Mental illness mostly solved
- Humanity pivots to space exploration
- Earth rated "Would not attack again" by aliens

### Where Every Dollar Goes (Decided by 8 Billion Brains, Not 12 Bureaucrats)

Here's the revolutionary part: We don't decide the budget. You do. All of you. Together.

**The Only Guaranteed Allocation:**
- **VICTORY Bond Returns (5% - $1.35B)**: Sacred and untouchable. Investors get paid first or nobody plays.

**Everything Else: Wishocracy Decides**

Instead of some committee in Washington deciding budgets, every human on Earth votes through pairwise comparisons:

"Patient subsidies for cancer trials" vs "Infrastructure for rural access"
*Swipe to allocate: 70% / 30%*

"First-cure prizes" vs "Platform security upgrades"  
*Swipe to allocate: 60% / 40%*

"Negative result publications" vs "AI diagnosis tools"
*Swipe to allocate: 45% / 55%*

Billions of these micro-decisions aggregate into humanity's true priorities.

**What Emerges (Probable Allocations Based on Human Nature):**

**Direct Patient Subsidies (~65-75%)**
- Why: People want treatments, not bureaucracy
- Covers: Medications, testing, travel, time lost
- Reality: Sick people vote for their own survival

**Infrastructure (~10-20%)**
- Why: Platform needs to not crash
- Covers: Servers, security, hospital integration
- Reality: Only as much as absolutely necessary

**Research Incentives (~10-15%)**
- Why: Carrots work better than sticks
- Covers: First-cure prizes, breakthrough bonuses
- Reality: Everyone loves a winner

**The Beautiful Chaos:**
- Year 1: Maybe 70% goes to subsidies (people desperate)
- Year 5: Maybe 60% to subsidies, 20% to prevention (people learning)
- Year 10: Maybe 40% subsidies, 40% infrastructure, 15% space medicine (people dreaming)

Nobody knows. Nobody controls. The swarm decides.

**Anti-Corruption Built In:**
- Can't bribe 8 billion people
- Can't capture a system with no center
- Can't redirect funds to your cousin's company
- Can't build a $600 million headquarters (looking at you, CDC)

The budget becomes a living organism that responds to humanity's actual needs, not what some committee thinks you need.

### The Feedback Loop That Eats The World

    A[1% Treaty: $27B] --> B[Subsidize 1M Patients]

    G --> H[Subsidize 5M Patients]

    I --> J[Save 1M Lives]
    J --> K[Nobel Prizes Rain Down]
    K --> L[5% Treaty Inevitable]
    L --> M[Death Optional by 2050]
```

This isn't a business model. It's a civilization upgrade disguised as healthcare reform.

**The Multiplier Effect (How $1 Becomes $463)**

Every dollar in the treasury generates:
- $50 in reduced trial costs (efficiency gains)
- $200 in prevented healthcare spending (cures > treatments)
- $150 in increased productivity (healthy people work)
- $63 in reduced suffering (happiness has value)
- **Total: $463 in societal value per dollar spent**

That's not return on investment. That's return on civilization.

## Operational Budget & Financial Model

### The Machine That Runs on Minimal Overhead (Unlike Government)

Here's what makes us different: The crowd decides how much to spend on operations versus treatments. No bloated bureaucracy because voters won't fund it.

**How Budget Allocation Actually Works:**

**The Only Fixed Cost:**
- VICTORY bond returns: 5% guaranteed (or investors walk)

**Everything Else: The Crowd Decides Through Wishocracy**

But here's what we expect will emerge (because humans are predictable):

**Direct Patient Impact (~80-90%):**
- Why: Sick people vote for treatments, not office buildings
- Probable breakdown:
  - Patient subsidies: 65-75% (people want cures)
  - Research prizes: 10-15% (everyone loves winners)
  - Prevention programs: 5-10% (smart people vote here)

**Operations (~10-20%):**
- Why: Just enough to keep the lights on
- Probable breakdown:
  - Platform infrastructure: 5-8% (can't work if it's down)
  - Security & fraud prevention: 3-5% (humans cheat)
  - Integration costs: 2-4% (hospitals need connections)
  - Administration: <2% (nobody votes for bureaucrats)

**Compare to Traditional Overhead:**
- NIH: 31% administrative costs (imposed by bureaucrats)
- Universities: 40-60% "indirect costs" (stolen by administrators)
- Big Pharma trials: 67% bureaucracy (captured by consultants)
- DIH: 10-20% total overhead (decided by patients)

The difference? When patients control the budget, money goes to cures, not corners offices. When bureaucrats control it, they build empires.

### The Bootstrap Phase: Getting to $27B

**Phase 0: Pre-Treaty (Years -3 to 0)**
- Raise $1.2-2.5B via VICTORY bonds
- Build dFDA platform MVP
- Run pilot programs (prove 82X efficiency)
- Political campaigns for treaty passage
- Burn rate: ~$500M/year

**Phase 1: Treaty Launch (Years 1-3)**
- $27B annual treasury operational
- 1-5 million patients enrolled
- 10,000+ treatments in trials
- Platform scaled globally
- Operating costs: 20% (learning phase)

**Phase 2: Efficiency Gains (Years 4-7)**
- 2% Treaty passed ($54B annually)
- 10-20 million patients enrolled
- 100,000+ treatments tested
- Automation reduces overhead
- Operating costs: 15% (target achieved)

**Phase 3: Exponential Scale (Years 8-10)**
- 5% Treaty passed ($135B annually)
- 50+ million patients enrolled
- 1 million+ treatments tested
- Full automation and AI optimization
- Operating costs: 10% (better than any charity)

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) That Actually Matter

**Traditional NIH Metrics (Stupid):**
- Papers published (who cares if nobody reads them)
- Grants awarded (celebrating spending, not results)
- Conferences attended (vacation metrics)
- Patents filed (legal paperwork ≠ cures)

**DIH Metrics (Smart):**

**Primary KPIs - Lives Saved:**
- QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life Years) generated
- Deaths prevented per dollar spent
- Time from discovery to patient access
- Cost per life saved (target: <$1,000)

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- Cost per patient in trials (target: $500)
- Patients enrolled per million spent
- Treatments tested per billion allocated
- Administrative overhead percentage (target: <15%)

**Access Metrics:**
- Percentage of global population with trial access
- Average distance to nearest trial site
- Languages supported in platform
- Income levels of participants (ensuring equity)

**Scientific Progress:**
- New treatments reaching patients annually
- Percentage of diseases with active trials
- Negative results published (100% target)
- Knowledge reuse rate (how often data helps next trial)

**Financial Sustainability:**
- Treaty expansion rate (1% → 2% → 5%)
- Cost reduction achieved (target: 82X)
- VICTORY bond returns delivered
- Secondary health savings generated

### The Financial Model: How $1 Becomes $463

**The Cascade of Value Creation:**

1. **Direct Trial Savings: 82X Efficiency**
   - Traditional trial: $41,000 per patient
   - DIH trial: $500 per patient
   - Savings: $40,500 per patient
   - With 54 million patients: $2.19 trillion saved

2. **Faster Cures: 10-Year Acceleration**
   - Traditional timeline: 17 years
   - DIH timeline: 2-3 years
   - 14 years of additional treatment access
   - Economic value: $5.4 trillion in productivity

3. **More Diseases Addressed: 100X Coverage**
   - Traditional: 5% of diseases get research
   - DIH: 100% of diseases get research
   - 95% more diseases with treatments
   - Lives saved: 10 million annually

4. **Prevention Focus: 3X ROI**
   - Every $1 in prevention saves $3 in treatment
   - Shift 20% to prevention: $600B saved
   - Reduced disease burden: $1.8 trillion

5. **Knowledge Compounds: Open Data**
   - No hidden failures (saves redundant research)
   - Global collaboration (accelerates progress)
   - AI-powered insights (pattern recognition)
   - Value: $2.1 trillion in avoided waste

**Total Societal Return: $463 per dollar invested**

### The Sustainability Flywheel

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Treaty Funds: $27B] --> B[Efficient Trials: 82X Cheaper]
    B --> C[More Cures: 1000X Scale]
    C --> D[Healthier Population]
    D --> E[Economic Growth: +$3.5T]
    E --> F[Political Support]
    F --> G[Bigger Treaty: 2%, 5%, 10%]
    G --> A
```

Each success makes the next success easier:
- More cures → More political support
- Bigger treasury → Lower costs per patient
- Better data → Smarter allocation
- Healthier people → Stronger economy
- Stronger economy → Bigger treaties

### Risk Mitigation: What Could Go Wrong?

**Risk 1: Treaty Adoption Failure**
- Mitigation: Start with willing nations (Switzerland, Singapore)
- Backup: Corporate partnerships fund initial operations
- Insurance: VICTORY bonds only release on success milestones

**Risk 2: Technology Platform Failure**
- Mitigation: Built on proven architecture (not blockchain nonsense)
- Backup: Multiple redundant systems
- Insurance: Open source allows community fixes

**Risk 3: Regulatory Capture**
- Mitigation: Fully transparent operations
- Backup: Multi-jurisdiction structure
- Insurance: Immutable smart contracts

**Risk 4: Fraud and Gaming**
- Mitigation: AI-powered anomaly detection
- Backup: Refundable deposits for participants
- Insurance: Small copays prevent frivolous use

**Risk 5: Political Backlash**
- Mitigation: Massive constituency of patients
- Backup: Results speak louder than lobbying
- Insurance: Once people get cures, no going back

### The Exit That Isn't An Exit

This isn't a startup that gets acquired. It's civilization infrastructure that becomes permanent:

**Year 10 Steady State:**
- Disease eradication becomes normal government function
- Military spending naturally declines (no enemies left)
- DIH evolves into global health maintenance system
- Death becomes increasingly optional
- Humanity pivots to space exploration

**The Final Budget (Year 20+):**
- 50% of former military budget → health research
- 30% → space exploration
- 20% → environmental restoration
- 0% → killing each other

We don't exit. We win. Then we maintain victory forever.
