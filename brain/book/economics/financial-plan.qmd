# Fundraising & Budget Plan: The Activation Energy

This document provides a comprehensive breakdown of the total capital required to successfully implement the 1% Treaty and establish the Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH). It is a supporting document for the overall strategy. The figures presented here are the basis for our **$1.2B - $2.5B total fundraising goal**.

## 1. Executive Summary: The "Activation Energy"

The capital raised is not for ongoing operations; it is a one-time "activation energy" required to overcome the political inertia of the current system. This investment is designed to unlock a perpetual, multi-generational funding stream of **$27+ billion annually** for global health.

**Note on Diligence Documents:** This document provides the high-level strategic budget. A detailed, bottom-up operational budget and a description of our full, spreadsheet-based financial model are available in our [Operational Budget & Financial Model Documentation](/brain/book/economics/financial-plan.qmd).

The budget is structured around a 36-month timeline and is divided into four primary operational categories.

## 2. Total Fundraising Requirement: $1.2B - $2.5B

The range reflects the variable nature of political campaigns and the potential to scale our efforts. A smaller, more targeted raise of $1.2B is considered the minimum viable amount, while a $2.5B raise would allow for a massively parallel, global campaign with a significantly higher probability of success.

### Multi-Phase Fundraising Strategy

The raise will be conducted in tranches, with each tranche tied to the achievement of specific, verifiable milestones.

1.  **Phase 1: Seed Round ($250M - $400M)**

    - **Goal:** To fund the development of the global referendum platform, establish the legal frameworks in pilot countries, and run the first electoral cycle interventions.
    - **Milestone to Unlock Phase 2:** Secure 50 million verified referendum participants and/or secure a pro-treaty legislative majority in a pilot G20 nation.

2.  **Phase 2: Series A ($500M - $1B)**

    - **Goal:** To expand political operations to all G7 nations and achieve the 3.5% global participation threshold (280 million people).
    - **Milestone to Unlock Phase 3:** Achieve the 3.5% threshold and/or secure the first national treaty commitment from a G7 nation.

3.  **Phase 3: Growth Round ($500M - $1.1B)**

    - **Goal:** To ensure treaty ratification in all major powers (US, EU, China) and fully capitalize the DIH treasury for its first year of operation.
    - **Milestone:** Full operational deployment and the first $1B disbursement.

## 3. Phased Operational Budget & Justification

The budget is not a monolithic block but is designed to be deployed in phases, directly corresponding to our fundraising tranches. This ensures that capital is used efficiently and that spending scales only with the achievement of verifiable milestones.

### Phase 1: Seed ($250M - $400M)

This initial phase is designed to build the core infrastructure and prove the model in a limited number of high-impact pilot regions.

# Fundraising Strategy: Simple Targets, Sophisticated Mechanics

## Executive Summary

To secure the **\$1.2–\$2.5 billion** in "activation energy" required to pass the 1% Treaty, we employ a sophisticated, multi-phase fundraising strategy. This strategy is designed to maximize the speed of capital acquisition while ensuring capital efficiency and minimizing risk for early investors.

Our approach is built on three pillars:

1.  **A Hybrid Communication Strategy:** Using simple, ambitious ROI targets for marketing to create broad appeal, while using efficient market-driven mechanisms on the backend.
2.  **De-Risking with Assurance Contracts:** Eliminating fundraising risk for early backers through a transparent, smart contract-based "money-back guarantee."
3.  **A Phased, Market-Driven Model:** Progressively de-risking the project and allowing the market to price risk and reward efficiently over time.

## The Hybrid Communication Strategy

Investor psychology requires a simple, powerful message. The underlying financial mechanics require efficiency. We achieve both.

- **Public-Facing Target (The "Hook"):** For marketing and high-level communications, we will lead with a simple, audacious, and mathematically defensible target:

  > **"We are targeting returns superior to the world's most elite hedge funds (~40% annualized), which projects to a ~28x return over 10 years. Our financial model is governed by a simple principle: investor payouts never exceed 50% of our income, guaranteeing our mission is always protected."**

  This message is designed to be memorable, signal the massive scale of the opportunity, and is credibly backed by our [Investment Thesis](/brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) and [Dynamic Cash Flow Model](/brain/book/economics/financial-plan.qmd).

- **Backend Mechanism (The "Engine"):** For financial structuring and sales to sophisticated investors, we will use efficient market mechanisms like **Dutch Auctions** for public funding tranches. This allows the market to perform price discovery, ensuring we secure capital at the lowest possible cost (i.e., the lowest acceptable ROI for investors), thus maximizing the funds left for the DIH treasury.

## De-Risking Early Investment with Assurance Contracts

The primary risk for an early investor is the collective action problem: "What if not enough other people invest?" We eliminate this risk entirely using **Assurance Contracts**.

- **Mechanism:** All initial funds will be deposited into a secure, transparent smart contract escrow. These funds are locked and cannot be accessed by the project team.
- **The Guarantee:** The smart contract has a pre-defined funding goal (e.g., \$250 million) and a deadline (e.g., 12 months).
- If the goal **is met** by the deadline, the funds are released to the project treasury.
- If the goal **is not met**, the funds are automatically and trustlessly returned to every single investor.
- **Net Benefit:** This "money-back guarantee" removes all fundraising risk for our backers, creating powerful social proof and encouraging faster, more confident commitments. We may also implement a **Dominant Assurance Contract (DAC)** model, where a patron offers a small bonus (e.g., extra governance tokens) to all participants if the goal is met, further incentivizing early support.

## Phased Fundraising Model

Our fundraising will occur in stages, aligning with project milestones to progressively de-risk the investment.

1.  **Seed Round:** The initial tranche ($250M–$400M) will be raised from strategic partners with fixed, highly attractive terms, secured by the assurance contract.
2.  **Public Sales:** Subsequent tranches will be sold via public offerings (e.g., Dutch auctions), allowing the market to price the instruments based on the project's progress and reduced risk profile.
