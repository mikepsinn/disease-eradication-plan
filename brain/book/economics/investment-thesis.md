## The Core Thesis: A Massively Undervalued Asset

The core investment thesis is built on a simple inefficiency: the misallocation of global capital towards destruction instead of creation.

1.  **The Mispriced Asset:** The world spends [**\$2.72 trillion**](../references.md#sipri-2024-spending) on war and [**\$67.5 billion**](../references.md#global-gov-med-research-spending) on curing disease. That's 40:1. This is insane.
2.  **The Arbitrage Opportunity:** We are executing a **political arbitrage** by investing a small amount ([\$1.2–2.5B](./fundraising/fundraising-budget-breakdown.md)) to influence the redirection of a massive, stable, recurring cash flow ([\$27B+ annually](../references.md#sipri-2024-spending)).
3.  **The ROI Engine:** This redirected capital is then invested in a system (the dFDA) that is **80 times more efficient** than the current standard, generating [\$50B in annual savings](../economics/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.md) and [840,000+ QALYs](../economics/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.md).

We are not creating a new market. We are capturing a tiny fraction of the world's largest pool of wasted capital and deploying it with radically higher efficiency.

## Why This is the Best Investment in the Universe

-   **The scale:** We're capturing 1% of the world's biggest pile of wasted money—[\$2.72 trillion in military spending](../references.md#sipri-2024-spending).
-   **The return profile:** The potential returns (~40% CAGR) are comparable to top-tier venture capital, but the risk profile is that of a political campaign, not a tech startup.
-   **The collateral:** The "asset" is not a speculative technology but a recurring, government-funded expenditure stream that has been stable for decades.

## 2. How We Beat the Best Investment Ever

The best investment in history made [**39% per year**](../references.md#top-pe-hedge-funds) for 30 years straight.

We target **40% per year** by using political leverage no hedge fund can access.

## 3. The Math

**Simple leverage:** You give us $2.5 billion, we control $27 billion per year. That's 10.8X leverage.

**The returns:** We target 40% annual returns, capped at 50% of treasury income. You make ~28X your money over 10 years.

**The scale:** We're capturing 1% of the world's biggest pile of wasted money—$2.7 trillion in military spending.

Our [cash flow spreadsheet](./dih-treasury-cash-flow-model.md) shows exactly how this works. Even if we only get half the money ($13B per year), you still make 26X your money over 10 years.

The treasury grows over time as more countries join. For details, see [The Endgame: A Multi-Generational Strategy to Phase Out War](../strategy/the-endgame-phasing-out-war.md).

## 4. How We Price the Risk

**The question:** What are the odds this actually works?

**The answer:** We use prediction markets (Metaculus, Polymarket) to find out in real time. If the odds are low, we pay higher returns. If the odds improve, we pay lower returns to new investors.

This turns political risk into something you can actually measure and price.

## 5. The Secret: Political Arbitrage

Defense contractors spend [$14 million on lobbying, get $70.8 billion in contracts](../references.md#military-lobbying-returns). That's 5,000% returns by buying government spending.

We're doing the same thing, but for curing disease instead of starting wars.



## 6. The Risks

This could fail. Here's what could go wrong and how we handle it:

**Politicians Don't Sign:** We need 280M people to vote for the referendum. **How we fix it:** Prediction markets price the risk in real time. If odds are low, we pay higher returns.

**We Run Out of Money:** If treaty money is delayed, you could lose your investment. **How we fix it:** First investors get paid first, and you can track our cash position in real time.

**Nobody Invests:** Early investors might worry we won't hit our funding target. **How we fix it:** Smart contract escrow. If we don't hit the target, you automatically get your money back.

**When You Get Paid:** You get paid when treaty money comes in, not on fixed dates. Big payments start 18–36 months after the first major country signs.

### Why Risk-Adjusted Returns Can Beat the MIC and Pharma

The financial case rests on several structural advantages that traditional investments in the military-industrial complex (MIC) and pharmaceutical industry cannot match:

- **Structural Value Capture**: We capture a stable, recurring public expenditure (1% of defense budgets) rather than relying on speculative product revenues. This creates a predictable inflow that underpins the entire model. See the [Peace Dividend Value Capture Model](./peace-dividend-value-capture.md).

- **Efficiency Arbitrage**: The 80x cost reduction in clinical trials, validated by the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](../reference/recovery-trial.md), dramatically lowers the capital required to produce a successful health outcome. This de-risks the investment on an operational level.

- **Uncorrelated Alpha**: Returns are driven by political adoption and the redirection of public budgets, not by market beta or the binary success/failure of a single drug. This provides a source of alpha that is uncorrelated with traditional markets.

- **Diversification**: The DIH treasury allocates funding across hundreds or thousands of interventions and diseases, creating a diversified portfolio that is resilient to the failure of any single research program.

- **Downside Resilience**: Even partial adoption (e.g., only the US, EU, & UK) creates a multi-billion dollar annual treasury, ensuring the model is robust and not dependent on unanimous global agreement.
