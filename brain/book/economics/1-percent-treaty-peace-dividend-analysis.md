## TL;DR

-   **Redirected Funds (Captured Dividend):** A 1% reduction in direct global military spending frees up **$24.43 billion annually**. This is the capital redirected by the 1% Treaty to fund the Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH).
-   **Total Economic Benefit (Societal Dividend):** A corresponding 1% reduction in the total costs of conflict generates **$91.97 billion in annual economic value**. This broader "peace dividend" includes savings from reduced infrastructure damage, fewer casualties, and less economic disruption.
-   **Source Data:** All calculations are derived from the figures presented in the [Cost of War analysis](../problem/cost-of-war.md).

## The Economics of a 1% Reduction in Violence

While the [dFDA cost-benefit analysis](./dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.md) focuses on the immense value generated by more efficient medical research, the funding for that research is sourced from a reduction in global conflict. This analysis quantifies the economic benefits unlocked by that reduction.

We can view the benefits in two parts: the direct funds captured for reallocation, and the broader societal dividend from decreased conflict.

### 1. The Captured Dividend: $24.43 Billion for Cures

The 1% Treaty specifically targets the **$2.443 trillion** spent globally on direct military expenditures. A 1% redirection of this spending provides the **$24.43 billion** annual treasury for the DIH.

**Calculation:**
`$2,443,000,000,000 (Direct Military Spending) × 0.01 = $24,430,000,000`

This is the foundational cash flow that powers the entire system, from funding research to paying returns on VICTORY bonds.

### 2. The Societal Dividend: $91.97 Billion in Annual Value

The true economic benefit extends far beyond the redirected funds. The [total annual cost of war is estimated at $9.2 trillion](../problem/cost-of-war.md). A 1% reduction in conflict and its associated costs creates a much larger economic benefit for the world.

This **$91.97 billion** societal dividend represents value retained by the global economy through:
-   Less infrastructure needing to be rebuilt.
-   Fewer lives lost and disrupted.
-   More stable trade and economic activity.
-   Reduced long-term costs for veteran care and refugee support.

The table below breaks down the annual savings from a 1% reduction across all categories of conflict-related costs.

### Detailed Breakdown of Annual Savings from a 1% Conflict Reduction

The following table itemizes the annual global savings based on the comprehensive cost analysis in [The Cost of War](../problem/cost-of-war.md).

| Cost Category | Total Annual Cost (Billions) | 1% Annual Savings (Billions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Costs** | **$5,934.0** | **$59.34** |
| Military Expenditure | $2,443.0 | $24.43 |
| Infrastructure Destruction | $1,875.0 | $18.75 |
| Human Life Losses | $1,000.0 | $10.00 |
| Trade Disruption | $616.0 | $6.16 |
| **Indirect Costs** | **$3,263.1** | **$32.63** |
| Lost Economic Growth | $2,443.0 | $24.43 |
| Veteran Healthcare | $200.1 | $2.00 |
| Refugee Support | $150.0 | $1.50 |
| Environmental Damage | $100.0 | $1.00 |
| Psychological Impact | $100.0 | $1.00 |
| Lost Human Capital | $270.0 | $2.70 |
| **Grand Total** | **$9,197.1** | **$91.97** |

By redirecting just **$24.43 billion** from military budgets, we not only fund a revolution in medical research but also unlock a broader societal dividend of nearly **$92 billion** every year. This makes the 1% Treaty one of the most leveraged and impactful economic proposals in history.
