## TL;DR

-   **What We Capture:** Cut global military spending by 1% and we get **$24.43 billion annually** to fund the Decentralized Institutes of Health.
-   **What We Save:** Cut the total costs of conflict by 1% and we save **$91.97 billion every year**. That's less money spent rebuilding bombed hospitals, treating war casualties, and dealing with refugees.
-   **Source:** All numbers come from our [Cost of War analysis](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd).

## The Economics of a 1% Reduction in Violence

Our [dFDA cost-benefit analysis](./dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) shows how much value we create with better medical research. But where does the money come from? We take it from global conflict. Here's what we get when we cut violence by just 1%.

The benefits break into two parts: the cash we redirect, and the broader savings from less war.

### 1. The Cash We Take: $24.43 Billion for Cures

Governments spend **$2.443 trillion** on militaries every year. We take 1% of that. Simple math:

**$2,443,000,000,000 × 0.01 = $24,430,000,000**

That **$24.43 billion** funds everything: the research, the VICTORY bond returns, the whole system.

### 2. What We Save: $91.97 Billion Every Year

But that's just the money we redirect. War costs the world [$9.2 trillion annually](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd). Cut conflict by 1% and we save **$91.97 billion** on top of what we redirect.

That's money we don't spend on:

-   Rebuilding bombed bridges and hospitals
-   Treating war casualties and PTSD
-   Supporting refugees and displaced families
-   Lost trade and economic disruption

Here's exactly where those savings come from:

### The Numbers: Where Every Dollar Gets Saved

This breaks down the annual global savings based on our [Cost of War analysis](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd).

| Cost Category | Total Annual Cost (Billions) | 1% Annual Savings (Billions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direct Costs** | **$5,934.0** | **$59.34** |
| Military Expenditure | $2,443.0 | $24.43 |
| Infrastructure Destruction | $1,875.0 | $18.75 |
| Human Life Losses | $1,000.0 | $10.00 |
| Trade Disruption | $616.0 | $6.16 |
| **Indirect Costs** | **$3,263.1** | **$32.63** |
| Lost Economic Growth | $2,443.0 | $24.43 |
| Veteran Healthcare | $200.1 | $2.00 |
| Refugee Support | $150.0 | $1.50 |
| Environmental Damage | $100.0 | $1.00 |
| Psychological Impact | $100.0 | $1.00 |
| Lost Human Capital | $270.0 | $2.70 |
| **Grand Total** | **$9,197.1** | **$91.97** |

We take **$24.43 billion** from military budgets and save the world **$92 billion** every year. That's $4 saved for every $1 redirected. 

Plus we get cures for cancer.
