The legal setup is more important than the money, which is saying something when there's $27.2B involved.

You're essentially bribing governments to redirect military spending. Except instead of paying politicians under the table (illegal, messy, tends to end in prison), you're paying voters to vote for politicians who support the treaty (legal, transparent, ends in democratic mandate).

This requires following international law, securities regulations, and election laws across 195 countries without violating a single rule in any of them. Simultaneously. While defense contractors use their lawyers to find any microscopic violation they can exploit.

The design is **bulletproof and legal.** Which is fortunate, because the alternative is "brilliant and illegal," which is just another way of saying "stupid with extra steps toward federal prison."

## On Why You Need Multiple Companies in Multiple Countries

Don't put everything in one company. That's how you accidentally violate 47 different laws at once.

Split it across multiple countries to optimize for each country's specific rules while keeping the core mission legally protected:

- **🇨🇭 Swiss Foundation:** The main organization.
Switzerland is neutral, crypto-friendly, and good at international law.
This handles the main $27.2B treasury.

- **🇺🇸 US Super PAC:** Completely separate entity that only Americans can fund, designed to influence US elections legally.
Zero coordination with the international stuff.

- **🇸🇬 Singapore Entity:** Handles crypto and treasury management in a place with clear crypto rules.
- **🇪🇪 Estonian Entity:** Builds the technology platform.
Estonia is [best in the world at digital governance](./references.qmd#estonia-eresidency-stats).

This splits up the legal risk and lets you optimize for each country's rules while keeping the core mission protected.

## On How to Sell Investment Products Without Going to Prison

**[VICTORY Bonds](./economics.qmd)** are securities. Tokens might be securities. The SEC has opinions about both.

The strategy: be so obviously compliant that regulators get bored trying to find violations.

### The Three-Tier Legal Strategy

#### Tier 1: Rich People (Accredited Investors)

Start by raising money from people who are legally allowed to make terrible investment decisions because they're rich enough to survive them. The SEC's logic: if you have $1 million net worth, you're smart enough to lose it. If you have $999,999, you need government protection from yourself.

Use standard private placement rules (Reg D 506(c) in the US, equivalents elsewhere). This provides a solid financial base while following every securities law on the books. Rich people understand risk better than regulators give them credit for, mostly because they've already taken bigger risks to get rich in the first place.

##### Tier 2: Regular People (Utility Tokens)

Regular people earn utility tokens for actions like voting, participating in trials, or contributing to the platform. These start as utility points, not investments.

They only become valuable AFTER the treaty passes and the system generates revenue. This timing [avoids the Howey Test securities law problems](./references.qmd#howey-test-securities) because there's no "expectation of profit from the efforts of others" at the time of distribution.

###### Tier 3: Marketing (No Bullshit Allowed)

Focus on what the project actually does, not get-rich-quick promises. Be painfully clear about risks. No hype. No "guaranteed returns." No techbro manifestos about disrupting death itself.

The marketing pitch is: "Help us redirect military spending to cure disease. If it works, you might make money. If it doesn't, you definitely won't. Invest accordingly."

Regulators love honesty. Mostly because they see so little of it that they don't know how to prosecute it. When the SEC investigates and finds that your prospectus literally says "you might lose everything," they have to move on to actual fraud cases. There are plenty of those.

## Dive Deeper into the Legal Framework

This chapter provides a high-level overview.
For a detailed breakdown of the specific legal structures and compliance strategies, please explore the following documents:

- **[Multi-Entity Strategy](./appendix/multi-entity-legal-strategy.qmd):** A detailed analysis of the international corporate structure designed to isolate risk and ensure jurisdictional compliance.
- **[Legal Compliance Framework](appendix/legal-compliance-framework.qmd):** The comprehensive strategy for navigating foreign election funding restrictions and securities law.
- **[HHS Policy Recommendations](./appendix/hhs-dFDA-policy-recommendations.qmd):** Specific, actionable policy recommendations for U.S. government agencies to support decentralized research.

## Appendix: Legal Compliance Details (Jurisdiction-Specific)

Every country has different rules about political spending. Every country thinks their rules are the most important. Every country is watching to make sure you follow THEIR rules while also following everyone else's contradictory rules.

Here's how you navigate this legal minefield:

- **United States:** Use independent-expenditure committees (Super PACs). Zero coordination with campaigns (wink wink). Comply with FEC reporting (every dollar tracked). Respect the foreign-national ban, this one actually matters because violating it means federal prison, not fines. Only US persons fund US election activities. Period. [FEC guidance](./references.qmd#fec-foreign-nationals) is surprisingly clear on this because they really, really don't want foreigners buying American democracy (that's Congress's job).

- **EU/UK/Canada/Japan and others:** Use lawful local equivalents (third-party campaigners, [non-party campaigners](./references.qmd#uk-electoral-spending-limits), PACs). Each country gets its own entity with local staff, local lawyers, local bank accounts, and local compliance officers who understand local nuances. The UK limits spending to £20,000 nationally because they're adorably optimistic that this stops influence. Canada requires real-time reporting above $500 because they're aggressively transparent. The EU has 27 different systems because unity is hard.

- **No quid-pro-quo contracts:** This is the critical distinction between legal political spending and illegal bribery. No smart contracts that automatically pay politicians for votes. No "if you vote yes, you get paid" agreements. Instead: independently observe public support, independently support politicians who agree with that public will, independently celebrate when they win elections. Everything happens independently (but predictably). Rewards flow based on verified district-level referendum results, not legislative votes. The incentive is implicit, not explicit. This is how Citizens United works. Learn from the masters.
