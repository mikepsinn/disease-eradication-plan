# The Decentralized FDA: Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Human Experimentation

## Objective: Stop Killing People with Clipboards

Listen: The FDA is a government agency that protects you from dangerous drugs by making sure you die of your disease before the cure gets approved.

It's like a lifeguard who spends 17 years checking if the life preserver is safe while you drown.



We're going to fix this by doing something revolutionary: letting sick people try medicines that might help them. I know, it's radical. But hear me out.

---

## A Brief History of Medical Bureaucracy (A Horror Story)

In 1962, some pregnant women took a drug called thalidomide and their babies were born looking like adorable flippers. This was bad.

So Congress, in its infinite wisdom, decided the solution was to make ALL drugs take 17 years to approve and cost $2.2 billion.

Now instead of occasional flipper babies, we have millions of people dying while waiting for paperwork.

Progress!

The FDA's current system works like this:
1. Scientists discover a cure for your disease
2. You wait 17 years
3. You die
4. The cure gets approved
5. Pharmaceutical companies charge your widow $10,000 per pill

It's a beautiful system if you're a mortician or a bankruptcy lawyer.

## The Complete List of Stupid Ways the FDA Kills You

### 💸 Problem 1: It Costs More Than a Small Country

**[$43,000 per person][1]** to test if a pill works.

That's not the pill. That's just to TEST the pill. For that money, you could:
- Buy a Tesla and crash it into the disease
- Hire a shaman for a year
- Fly to Switzerland for assisted dying (much faster)

The total cost to develop one new drug? **[$2.2 billion][2]**. 

That's more than the GDP of Greenland. We could literally buy Greenland and turn it into a giant laboratory for less than it costs to approve one arthritis medication.

### ⏰ Problem 2: Everyone Dies Waiting

**[17 years][6]** from "Eureka!" to "Take two and call me."

That's:
- 4 presidential terms
- 2 new iPhone models becoming obsolete 
- Your entire child growing up and moving out
- You dying of whatever the cure was for

During those 17 years, **[21,000 to 120,000 people die][3]** who didn't have to. That's between a small city and a medium city of corpses. Every decade.

But at least the paperwork is thorough!

### 🚫 Problem 3: The Velvet Rope of Death

**[85% of sick people][4]** aren't allowed in clinical trials.

Why? Because they're too sick. Or not sick enough. Or the wrong kind of sick. Or they live too far from the hospital. Or they're taking other medications. Or they once looked at an aspirin.

It's like having a cure for cancer but only giving it to people who don't have cancer.

Clinical trials have more exclusion criteria than a country club in 1950s Alabama:
- You can't be too old (might die of being old)
- You can't be too young (might live too long)
- You can't be pregnant (fair enough)
- You can't have other diseases (everyone over 40)
- You can't be on other medications (everyone with diseases)
- You must live near a trial site (hope you're rich and urban)
- You must have exact lab values (measured by angels)

So we test drugs on the 15% of patients who are basically already healthy, then act surprised when the drugs don't work for actual sick people.

Genius!

### 🦄 Problem 4: Rare Diseases Can Go F*** Themselves

**[95% of rare diseases][5]** have ZERO approved treatments.

Why? Math.

If your disease only affects 10,000 people, and it costs $2.2 billion to develop a drug, each patient would need to pay $220,000 just to break even.

So pharmaceutical companies focus on:
- Erectile dysfunction (affects: half of all men's egos)
- Baldness (affects: men with money)
- Wrinkles (affects: women with money)
- Cholesterol (affects: everyone who eats)

Meanwhile, if you have Exploding Kidney Syndrome affecting 37 people worldwide, the FDA's message is: "Have you tried not having Exploding Kidney Syndrome?"

### 📊 Problem 5: We Hide Our Failures Like Soviet Russia

**[Half of all clinical trials never publish their results][10]**.

Company: "We tested this drug!"
FDA: "Did it work?"
Company: "...We tested this drug!"

This means we spend billions testing the same failed drugs over and over because nobody admits they failed. It's like playing poker where everyone claims they won but nobody shows their cards.

Pharmaceutical companies bury negative results deeper than Jimmy Hoffa. So other companies waste billions testing the same dead ends. 

Your insurance premiums are paying for this stupidity.



### 🧪 Problem 6: The 166 Billion Treatments We're Ignoring

There are **[166 billion potential drug compounds][7]** we could test.

Number we've actually tested thoroughly: About 2,000.

That's like having a library with 166 billion books but only reading the ones with pictures.

At our current rate of testing, we'll have evaluated all possible treatments by the year 3,847,293. 

Hope your descendants enjoy the cure for cancer!

### 🎰 Problem 7: The FDA Requires Psychic Powers

Before you can test a drug, you must tell the FDA EXACTLY what it will cure and EXACTLY how you'll measure that cure.

"This drug will reduce depression by 37.2% as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale on Tuesdays."

What if it cures depression by 90% but only on Wednesdays? Failed trial.
What if it doesn't cure depression but eliminates anxiety? Failed trial.
What if it cures cancer instead? Failed trial, also please report to prison.

It's like requiring Columbus to file a detailed map of America before letting him sail west.

---

## The Solution: Just Let People Try Stuff (Carefully)

Here's a thought that apparently never occurred to anyone in Washington:

What if sick people could just... try treatments?

And then we could... write down what happens?

And then other sick people could... see what worked?

I know, I know. Without 17 years of paperwork, how would we know if medicines are safe? We'd have to rely on primitive methods like "observing if people get better or die."

### Introducing FDA.gov 2.0: Now With 80% Less Death

We're going to upgrade FDA.gov from a digital cemetery to something useful. Cost: Less than one fighter jet that doesn't work.

Here's the revolutionary process:

### Step 1: Type in What's Killing You

<img src="https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/enter-condition.png" alt="Enter condition" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Revolutionary feature: A search box. The FDA's current website doesn't have this because they assume you've already died.

### Step 2: See What Actually Works (Based on Reality, Not Theory)

<img src="https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/dfda/video/img/clinipedia-inflammatory-pain-small.gif" alt="View ranked treatments" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Instead of "This drug is approved for exactly this condition in exactly these patients on exactly Tuesdays," you get:

"Here's what happened to 50,000 people who tried this:
- 40% got much better
- 30% got somewhat better
- 20% no change
- 10% grew a third nipple (but a useful one)"

It's like Yelp, but for not dying.

### Step 3: Join a Trial from Your Couch (While Dying Comfortably)

<img src="https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/video/autonomous-study-search.gif" alt="Join trials" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Current system: Drive 500 miles to a university hospital, wait 6 months, get rejected for having the wrong kind of dying.

New system: Click button. Get pills. Report if you die.

Revolutionary!

### Step 4: Get Drugs Delivered Like Pizza (But More Life-Saving)

<img src="https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/video/autonomous-cvs.gif" alt="Get treatment" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Amazon can deliver a banana costume in 2 hours but experimental medications take 6 months and require seven forms of ID?

We're fixing that. Your pharmacy becomes a trial site. Your doctor becomes a researcher. Your dying becomes data.

### Step 5: Report Results Without a PhD in Paperwork

<img src="https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/video/reminder-inbox.gif" alt="Report outcomes" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Current system: 500-page case report forms that ask questions like "Rate your suffering on a scale of mauve to burnt sienna."

New system: 
- "Are you dead?" Yes/No
- "If no, how dead do you feel?" Slider bar
- "Any new body parts?" Check all that apply

### Step 6: Everyone Benefits from Everyone's Suffering

<img src="https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/video/black-box-model-animation2.gif" alt="Improve rankings" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Your data helps the next person. Their data helps you. It's socialism, but for not dying.

Every pill becomes a tiny experiment. Every patient becomes a scientist. Every outcome gets recorded.

It's what we should have been doing since we invented writing.

## The Money Shot: How We Save 95% on Not Killing People

Look at these beautiful savings! It's like Black Friday, but for survival!

| What We're Fixing | Current Insanity | New Reality | Money Saved | Lives Saved |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Years to get treatment | **17 years** | **2 years** | 15 years of suffering | ~50,000/year |

| Rare diseases with treatments | **5%** | **Eventually 100%** | Priceless | Millions |

### The Itemized Receipt of Stupidity We're Eliminating

| Stupid Expense | What FDA Pays | What We'll Pay | Savings | What It Actually Is |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 💾 Data Management | $198,014 | $10,000 | 94.9% | Excel spreadsheets with fear |
| ✅ IRB Approval | $324,081 | $5,000 | 98.5% | Permission slips for adults |
| 📝 IRB Amendments | $6,347 | $0 | 100% | Permission to fix typos |

| 🎯 Patient Retention | $76,879 | $20,000 | 74% | Bribes to keep dying people interested |
| 👨‍⚕️ Research Associates | $2,379,605 | $150,000 | 93.7% | People who watch you take pills |
| 👩‍⚕️ Physicians | $1,966,621 | $100,000 | 94.9% | Doctors pretending to be scientists |
| 🏥 Clinical Procedures | $5,937,819 | $1,000,000 | 83.2% | Poking you with expensive things |
| 🧪 Laboratory | $2,325,922 | $500,000 | 78.5% | Testing if your pee is still pee |
| 🏢 Site Recruitment | $849,158 | $0 | 100% | Bribing hospitals to participate |
| 🏗️ Site Retention | $4,461,322 | $0 | 100% | Bribing hospitals to not quit |
| 👥 Administrative Staff | $7,229,968 | $100,000 | 98.6% | People who file the files |
| 📊 Site Monitoring | $4,456,717 | $0 | 100% | People who watch the people who watch you |
| 🏢 Site Overhead | $7,386,816 | $0 | 100% | Electricity for the filing cabinets |
| 📎 All Other | $17,096,703 | $100,000 | 99.4% | Nobody knows but it's expensive |
| **TOTAL STUPIDITY** | **$56,988,007** | **$2,025,000** | **95.7%** | **The price of bureaucracy** |

We're eliminating $55 million of paperwork per trial. That's 55 million pieces of paper nobody reads, filed in cabinets nobody opens, in buildings nobody visits.

Those papers killed more people than they saved.

## Real Examples of This Working (While the FDA Wasn't Looking)

### The Oxford Recovery Trial: How the British Accidentally Saved Medicine

During COVID, while America was filling out forms, Oxford University did something crazy: they just tested drugs on dying people to see if they stopped dying.

Cost per patient:
- FDA trials: $41,000
- Oxford trial: $500

That's not a typo. Five hundred dollars. The cost of a nice dinner in Manhattan to save a human life.

Results:
- Found that steroids cut COVID deaths by 30%
- Saved over 1 million lives globally
- Took 3 months instead of 3 years
- Cost less than one Super Bowl commercial

The FDA's response: "But did they file the correct paperwork?"

### Wikipedia for Whether You'll Die

We're building **Clinipedia**: Wikipedia but instead of arguing about whether tomatoes are fruits, we argue about whether they cure cancer.

Every treatment gets a page. Every outcome gets recorded. Every patient contributes data.

Imagine looking up your disease and seeing:

**"Exploding Kidney Syndrome"**
*From Clinipedia, the encyclopedia of not dying*

**Current Treatments Ranked by Not-Dying Score:**
1. Prayer (3% effective, 0% side effects)
2. Experimental Drug XJ-47 (67% effective, 30% chance of jazz hands)
3. Traditional medicine (5% effective, tastes like sadness)
4. Doing nothing (0% effective, 100% chance of exploded kidneys)
5. Essential oils (0% effective, room smells nice while you die)

*This page based on data from 10,847 patients who contributed their suffering to science*

## Your Personal Death-Prevention Assistant: The FDAi

We're giving everyone a superintelligent doctor that lives in their phone and doesn't judge them for Googling "is my poop normal?"

The **FDAi** (Food and Drug Artificial intelligence) is like Siri, but instead of telling you the weather, it tells you how not to die.

**You**: "I have diabetes and my foot fell off."
**FDAi**: "Based on 50,000 similar cases, here's what worked:
- 60% success: Reattachment surgery + Drug A
- 30% success: Prosthetic foot + Drug B  
- 10% success: Hopping lessons + Prayer
- 0% success: Essential oils (but your remaining foot will smell lavender-fresh)"

It's like having every doctor who ever lived in your pocket, except they actually agree on something.

## The Digital Twin Safe: Your Medical Data's Panic Room

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2808553/180306571-ac9cc741-6f34-4059-a814-6f8a72ed8322.png" alt="Digital Twin Safe" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Right now, your medical data is scattered across:
- 17 different doctors who don't talk
- 5 insurance companies that hate you
- 3 pharmacies that can't spell your name
- 1 veterinarian (long story)

We're putting it all in one place: Your Digital Twin Safe. It's like a Swiss bank account, but for your cholesterol levels.

You control who sees what:
- Insurance companies: "He's mostly alive"
- Doctors: Everything
- Researchers: Anonymized data
- Facebook: Absolutely nothing, Mark

## Outcome Labels: Nutrition Facts for Drugs

<img src="https://wiki.dfda.earth/assets/outcome-labels.PNG" alt="Outcome Labels" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Food has nutrition labels. Cigarettes have warning labels. Drugs have... incomprehensible 40-page inserts written by lawyers having seizures.

We're fixing that:

**DEPRESSION CRUSHER 3000™**
*Outcome Label*

Based on 50,000 humans who tried this:
- 📈 Depression: ⬇️ 60% reduction
- 😴 Sleep: ⬆️ 30% improvement  
- 🍆 Sex drive: ⬇️ 90% reduction (sorry)
- 🎺 Spontaneous jazz hands: 15% chance
- 💀 Death: 0.01% (better than depression!)

*This label based on actual humans, not laboratory rats who've never paid rent*

## The Disease Eradication Act: Making It Legal to Not Die

<img src="https://wiki.dfda.earth/right_to_trial_act_image.jpg" alt="Disease Eradication Act" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

We need a law that says: "Dying people can try things that might help them not die."

The fact that we need a law for this tells you everything about our species.

**The Right to Trial Act** (working title: "The Stop Being Stupid About Medicine Act"):

**Section 1**: If you're dying, you can try experimental treatments.
**Section 2**: We'll write down what happens.
**Section 3**: Other dying people can read what we wrote.
**Section 4**: Repeat until nobody's dying.
**Section 5**: Seriously, how was this not already the law?

Congress will debate this for 17 years, the same time it takes to approve one drug.

## The Future: Where Death Becomes Embarrassing

### 2027: The Beginning of the End of Dying Slowly

FDA.gov becomes actually useful. Millions join trials from home. The first "Wikipedia disease" gets cured entirely through crowdsourced trials. The FDA claims credit.

### 2030: Big Pharma Pivots or Dies

Pharmaceutical companies realize they can't charge $10,000 for pills that cost $1 to make when everyone can see the data. Some adapt. Some become museums.

### 2035: The Great Revelation

We realize we could have done this all along. We had the internet since 1990. We had computers since 1950. We had writing since 3000 BC.

We spent 5,000 years letting people die while we filled out forms.

History books will call us "The Paperwork Age" and children will laugh at our stupidity.

### 2050: Death Becomes Opt-In

Diseases are mostly solved. Death becomes a choice, like smoking or voting Republican. The FDA's job becomes preventing people from becoming immortal too quickly (traffic is bad enough).

The last FDA form is filled out. It's immediately lost. Nobody notices.

---

## The Opposition (And Why They're Wrong But Rich)

**Big Pharma**: "But how will we charge $10,000 per pill?"
**Answer**: You won't.

**The FDA**: "But what about safety?"
**Answer**: We'll track actual outcomes instead of theoretical ones. Revolutionary, we know.

**Insurance Companies**: "But how will we deny coverage?"
**Answer**: There won't be anything to deny. Treatments will cost less than your denial letters.

**Congress**: "But who will donate to our campaigns?"
**Answer**: The millions of people who didn't die. They vote.

**Lawyers**: "But what about lawsuits?"
**Answer**: Can't sue if the treatment works and costs $5.

**Medical Journals**: "But what about peer review?"
**Answer**: 50,000 patients ARE the peer review.

---

## The Bottom Line: Stop Murdering People with Paperwork

Listen: We have a medical system that kills more people with bureaucracy than disease kills with biology.

We make dying people wait 17 years for cures that already exist.

We charge $2 billion to test pills that could cost $2.

We exclude 85% of patients from trials then wonder why drugs don't work for 85% of patients.

We hide negative results like state secrets then repeat the same failures forever.

This isn't healthcare. It's a death cult with excellent filing systems.

The dFDA changes all that. Not through revolution, but through the radical act of writing down what happens when sick people take medicine.

It's so simple that only humans could have made it complicated.

But we're going to fix it. We're going to cure diseases. We're going to save lives.

And the FDA? They can keep filing their forms. In a museum. Where they belong.

After all, we're all going to die anyway.

Might as well die trying to live.
