# 📖 Chapter 5: The dFDA - How We Prove What Works

The **Decentralized FDA (dFDA)** is the engine of the DIH. It is an open-source, decentralized protocol for clinical research designed to be **[80 times more efficient](./reference/recovery-trial.md)** than the current system.

Its purpose is to define the rules and standards that allow a competitive ecosystem of companies, universities, and patient groups to conduct research faster, cheaper, and more transparently.

## How It Works

1.  **Patient Subsidies:** Instead of funding institutions, the DIH pays patients directly to join trials. Researchers only get paid when patients choose their study.

2.  **Pragmatic Trials:** We use the hyper-efficient **[Oxford RECOVERY model](./reference/recovery-trial.md)**, which cuts per-patient costs from $41,000 to $500. This allows us to run 80X more research with the same amount of money.

3.  **Open Data:** All trial data is published to a decentralized ledger in real-time. Negative results cannot be hidden. Cherry-picking data is impossible.

4.  **Outcome Labels:** The dFDA analyzes the data to produce simple, honest "outcome labels" for every food, drug, and supplement, showing what actually works.

This creates a complete, end-to-end system for generating trustworthy data on the safety and effectiveness of all treatments.
