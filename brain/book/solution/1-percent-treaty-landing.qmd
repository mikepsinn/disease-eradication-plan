## The Plan, for People Who Have Shit to Do

**The Problem:** Humanity spends [$2.7 trillion a year on weapons](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending) and about 40 times less on curing the diseases that will definitely kill you. This is stupid.

**The Solution:** We get every country to sign a treaty redirecting a pathetic **1%** of their military budget to a global fund. That's it. They keep 99% of their bombs.

**The Result:**
1.  **\$27 Billion/Year** flows into a treasury that funds hyper-efficient medical trials.
2.  **You Get Rich:** Investors who fund the political campaign get a cut of that \$27 billion. Forever.
3.  **You Don't Die:** The trials actually cure diseases.

It's the most ridiculously simple, profitable, and life-altering plan ever conceived. It's what would happen if capitalists accidentally did something good for humanity.

### 1. The Treaty: Stealing 1% of the Murder Budget

We're not asking for world peace overnight. We're asking for 1% less war. The [1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) is a binding international agreement where every signatory nation agrees to trim a single penny from every dollar they spend on their military and redirect it.

-   **Why it works:** It's a simultaneous cut. No country loses its "strategic advantage" because everyone does it at the same time. In fact, everyone becomes *more* secure because their enemies also have 1% fewer things to kill them with.
-   **The Payoff:** This tiny fraction unleashes **\$27 billion** annually. That's enough to fund **54,000 clinical trials** and treat **27 million patients** every single year.

### 2. The Referendum: Asking Humanity If It Wants to Live

How do you get 190 countries to agree on anything? You don't ask the politicians. You ask their bosses: the 8 billion people who would prefer not to die from preventable illnesses.

The [Global Referendum](../strategy/global-referendum.qmd) is a planetary vote on a single question: "Should we redirect 1% of military spending to cure disease?"

-   **The Magic Number:** History shows that once 3.5% of a population gets behind a movement, it has *never failed* to create systemic change. That's our target.
-   **The Viral Engine:** We're not just asking for signatures; we're building a movement with economic incentives. Participants earn rewards that convert to real value when the treaty passes. It's a pyramid scheme for saving the world.

### 3. VICTORY Bonds: Better Returns Than Cocaine Trafficking

This isn't a charity. It's the most ludicrously profitable investment opportunity in human history. To fund the lobbying and global referendum campaign, we're raising a **\$1 billion war chest** by selling [VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd).

Here's the deal we offer investors:
-   **You put in:** \$1,000 (minimum).
-   **You get back:** A perpetual 10% share of the \$27 billion treaty money. That's **\$2.7 billion** split among bondholders every year.
-   **The ROI:** A staggering **270% annual return**.

It's political arbitrage. You're betting \$1 billion that you can convince humanity to redirect \$27 billion. If it works, you get paid forever. If it fails, you lose your money... but you were going to die of a curable disease anyway. At least you went down swinging.
