The NIH is a $47 billion machine designed to prevent medical progress by rewarding grant-writing over research. 

You don't fix a system like that. You replace it.

The Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) is what you build when you want to cure diseases instead of writing papers about them. It's not a better bureaucracy; it's an anti-bureaucracy, built on four simple rules.

## The Four Rules of a System That Actually Works

### Rule 1: Let Patients Decide What Gets Funded

**The Problem:** The NIH has 200 bureaucrats in a room trying to predict which of thousands of diseases matters most. They are always wrong.

**The DIH Solution:** Give the money directly to patients in the form of subsidies. Let them, in consultation with their doctors, decide which clinical trials to join. The trials that attract patients get funded. The ones that don't, die.

This replaces a grant-writing contest with a distributed supercomputer of millions of patients and doctors, all with skin in the game. It's the collective intelligence of humanity voting with its feet.

### Rule 2: Pay for Cures, Not for Promises

**The Problem:** The NIH pays scientists for writing grant applications. This is like paying a chef for writing a menu instead of cooking a meal.

**The DIH Solution:** Pay for results. Researchers get paid in two ways:

1.  **Per-patient funding:** The more patients who believe in your trial enough to join, the more funding you get.
2.  **Outcome Bounties:** Massive, multi-billion dollar prizes for solving the big problems (e.g., "$1 billion to the first team to reverse aging by 10 years").

In the NIH, you get rich by writing proposals. In the DIH, you get rich by curing diseases.

### Rule 3: Make Corruption Mathematically Impossible

**The Problem:** Any institution controlling billions of dollars becomes a target for lobbyists and grifters.

**The DIH Solution:** Build the system on transparent, open-source code.

- **Algorithmic Governance:** All funding rules are encoded in smart contracts. Code can't take bribes.
- **No CEO:** There's no one to corrupt. No central point of failure.
- **Public Ledger:** Every single dollar is tracked on a public blockchain. It's a live-streamed financial colonoscopy for the entire world to see.

This isn't about trusting people to be good. It's about building a system where being bad is impossible.

### Rule 4: Publish Everything (Especially the Failures)

**The Problem:** Companies and researchers hide their failed experiments. This means scientists around the world waste billions of dollars and decades of time repeating the same mistakes.

**The DIH Solution:** Make 100% open publication of all data, positive and negative, a condition of funding.

- Every trial, every result, every dataset is published for the world to see.
- AI models continuously scan this global data commons, finding patterns and connections humans would miss.

This simple rule instantly doubles the value of every dollar spent on research by eliminating redundant failures.

## The Core Innovation: Pay for Success

Every dollar in the DIH flows based on results, not promises:

- **Patients vote with their enrollment** → Researchers get paid for attracting patients (market signal of efficacy)
- **Communities vote with their pools** → Bounties get paid for solving problems (not for proposing solutions)
- **No one gets paid for:**
  - Writing grant proposals
  - Attending review committees
  - Publishing papers about why their research might work someday

This isn't radical. It's how every other industry works. You pay contractors when they build the house, not when they promise to build it. You pay farmers when they grow the food, not when they apply for a farming license.

The NIH pays for permission to do research. The DIH pays for research that works.

**Single-sentence summary:** The DIH is what you get when you pay scientists like you pay plumbers, for fixing the problem, not for explaining why it's hard.

## How the Money Flows

1.  **Fill the Treasury:** The [1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) redirects **$27 billion** a year from global military budgets into the DIH treasury.
2.  **Humanity Sets the Rules:** The global population uses a system called [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) to vote on the high-level budget allocation. They don't pick specific trials; they set the rules for the whole system (e.g., "70% of all funds go directly to patient subsidies," "10% for moonshot prizes").
3.  **Patients Fund Cures:** The money flows to patients as subsidies, creating a market where the best research attracts funding directly from the people who need it most.

This structure also allows for **Emergent Institutes**—patient communities for specific diseases (e.g., the Decentralized Cancer Institute) can pool a fraction of their resources to fund large-scale projects and prizes that a pure individual market might overlook.

## The Result: A 10-100x Improvement in QALY Production Efficiency

The DIH isn't incrementally better than the NIH. Through pure mechanism design, no new technology, no better scientists, it achieves a **phase change in economic efficiency.**

### Projected Performance Metrics

| Metric | NIH (Current) | DIH (Projected) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Payment trigger** | Grant approved | Results achieved | **Incentive revolution** |
| **Cost per QALY** | [$50,000-$150,000](../references.qmd#nih-cost-per-qaly) | $5,000-$15,000 | **10x reduction** |
| **Overhead percentage** | [50-67%](../references.qmd#grant-writing-time-50pct) | <10% | **6x reduction in waste** |
| **Time to treatment** | [10-17 years](../references.qmd#drug-development-timeline) | 2-4 years | **4x faster** |
| **Publication rate** | ~50% (positive results only) | 100% (all results) | **2x knowledge base** |
| **Trials run annually** | ~5,000 major trials | 50,000-500,000 trials | **10-100x scale** |
| **Researcher time on research** | 33-50% | >90% | **2x productivity** |

### How the Efficiency Gains Compound

These aren't independent improvements, they multiply:

1. **10x cost reduction** per QALY through elimination of overhead
2. **2x knowledge multiplier** from mandatory publication of all results
3. **4x speed multiplier** from cutting bureaucratic delays
4. **100x scale** from distributed trial infrastructure ([dFDA](../solution/dfda.qmd))

**Combined conservative estimate:** 10 × 2 × 4 × 10 = **800x improvement** in QALY production rate

#### What This Means in Practice

The DIH + dFDA system, operating on the 1% Treaty budget of $27.2B annually, could produce more QALYs than the entire current global medical research output. By 2040, this could mean:

- Cancer survival rates above 90% (currently ~68%)
- Aging treated as a reversible condition
- Rare diseases no longer "too expensive" to cure
- Personalized medicine available to everyone, not just billionaires

**The fundamental difference:** The NIH pays researchers to explain why curing cancer is hard. The DIH pays them to actually cure it.

This is what happens when you optimize for living instead of paperwork. When you pay for success instead of grant applications. When you replace committees with code and bureaucrats with math.

You replace a system that values credentials with one that values breathing. This is what happens when you stop paying people to ask permission and start paying them to deliver results.
