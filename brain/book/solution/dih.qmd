The National Institutes of Health is where good ideas go to die of paperwork.

Every year, the NIH gets $47 billion to cure diseases. They spend most of it on:

- Committees to form committees
- Grants to study whether they should give grants
- Buildings in Bethesda that look important
- Researchers writing 100-page proposals that nobody reads
- Rejecting 90% of everything
- Making the other 10% wait 2 years to start

It's like hiring firefighters who spend all their time writing essays about water instead of putting out fires.



The **Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)** is what happens when you design a medical research system while sober and not actively trying to kill people with bureaucracy.

Here's how to build it: Take the $27 billion from the 1% Treaty and route it directly to people solving problems, instead of people asking permission to solve problems.

Revolutionary, I know.

## The NIH: A Case Study in How to Waste $47 Billion

### How the NIH Currently Works (A Tragedy in Five Acts)

**Act I: The Researcher Has an Idea**
Dr. Smith discovers something that might cure pancreatic cancer. She's excited. She's naive. She doesn't know what's coming.

**Act II: The Grant Application**
Dr. Smith spends 6 months writing a 100-page grant proposal. It includes:

- 47 citations proving she's not insane
- A budget accurate to the penny for work she hasn't done yet
- Promises about outcomes she can't possibly predict
- Her entire life story
- References from people who barely remember her
- A diversity statement
- An environmental impact report
- Probably her blood type

**Act III: The Waiting**
Dr. Smith waits 9 months for review. During this time:

- 1,000 people die of pancreatic cancer
- Her lab runs out of money
- Her best researcher takes a job at Facebook
- She develops a drinking problem

**Act IV: The Rejection**
Her grant is rejected. Success rate: 10%. Feedback: "Not innovative enough" (translation: we gave the money to someone who knows someone).

**Act V: The Loop**
Dr. Smith rewrites the grant. Resubmits. Repeats. By the time she gets funding, either:

- Someone else cured pancreatic cancer
- She's dead
- Pancreatic cancer evolved thumbs

This is how we spend $47 billion a year.



### The Numbers That Make Angels Weep

The NIH employs approximately 18,000 people. Of these:

- 6,000 are scientists (actually doing science)
- 12,000 are administrators (watching the scientists)

That's two bureaucrats for every researcher. It's like having two managers for every McDonald's fry cook, except the fries cure cancer and the managers prevent them from being made.

**Time researchers spend on actual research**: 40%
**Time researchers spend asking for money**: 40%
**Time researchers spend reporting on the money they asked for**: 20%
**Time researchers spend crying in the supply closet**: Uncounted but significant

## How to Design the DIH Like an Adult

### Build for These Core Outcomes: More Cures, Faster, Cheaper

**Your goal: Deliver 80X more medical research per dollar spent.**

This isn't theoretical. The Oxford RECOVERY trial proved it: $500 per patient instead of $41,000, finding effective COVID treatments in weeks while the NIH was still filing paperwork.

**Structure the system to deliver these concrete outcomes:**

1. **80X Cost Efficiency:** Pragmatic trials cost $500/patient vs $41,000 traditional. With the same $27 billion, the DIH can test 54 million patient-treatments instead of 658,000. That's not an improvement; it's a different universe.

2. **10X Speed Improvement:** Treatments reach patients in 2-3 years instead of 17. For cancer patients who have 6 months to live, this is the difference between death and cure.

3. **1,000X More Treatments Tested:** By eliminating paperwork and bureaucracy, the DIH can test every promising compound, not just the profitable ones. Those 166 billion untested compounds? The system can actually try them.

4. **Optimal Resource Allocation:** Using econometric analysis and crowd wisdom to minimize DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) and maximize QALYs (quality-adjusted life years). Every dollar goes where it saves the most life-years.

5. **100% Data Transparency:** Every trial result published, positive or negative. No more wasting billions repeating failures because companies hid negative results. Knowledge compounds.

6. **Universal Patient Access:** 100% of patients can join trials (vs 15% currently). Subsidies mean poor people can participate. Rural people can participate. Everyone can contribute to and benefit from medical progress.

7. **Direct Economic Return:** Healthier population = $3.5 trillion annual productivity gain. Reduced healthcare costs = $2.8 trillion saved. The economic benefits alone justify the investment, even ignoring the human benefits.

**The Mechanism to Build:** Pay patients to participate in trials, use software instead of bureaucrats, and publish everything. The outcome is revolutionary: actually curing diseases at scale.

Don't create another NIH. Create the opposite of the NIH.

Instead of one massive bureaucracy in Maryland deciding everything, create disease-specific groups that actually give a damn:

### Implement the Revolutionary Concept: Patient Choice Drives Research Priorities

Instead of a central committee dictating research, the DIH is composed of specialized institutes that emerge organically from patient needs. When patients use their subsidies to join trials on the dFDA, they are collectively directing funds toward specific disease areas.

This creates a market-driven structure where the institutes with the most patient demand and the most promising research receive the most funding.

- The **Decentralized Cancer Institute** grows because millions of patients are funding cancer trials.
- The **Decentralized Institute of Mental Health** is funded by individuals seeking better mental health solutions.
- The **Decentralized Institute on Aging** is powered by those who want to extend their healthspan.
- The **Decentralized Institute of Rare Diseases** allows even small patient groups to pool resources and attract researchers.

This model ensures that research priorities are set by the people who are actually sick, in consultation with their doctors, based on real-world data from the dFDA.

### The Emergent Institutes (A Non-Exhaustive List)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### The DIH Structure Emerges from Patient Need

**Major Killing Machines (The Big Institutes):**

- **Decentralized Cancer Institute (DCI)** - For cells that forgot how to die
- **Decentralized Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (DHLBI)** - For organs that pump, breathe, and leak
- **Decentralized Institute on Aging (DIA)** - For the crime of not dying young
- **Decentralized Institute of Mental Health (DIMH)** - For brains that hate their owners

**The Specialty Death Dealers:**

- **Decentralized Eye Institute (DEI)** - For eyeballs going dark
- **Decentralized Institute on Deafness (DIDCD)** - For ears that gave up
- **Decentralized Institute of Diabetes (DIDDKD)** - For bodies that can't handle sugar
- **Decentralized Institute of Arthritis (DIAMSD)** - For joints made of gravel

**The "Your Habits Will Kill You" Division:**

- **Decentralized Institute on Alcohol Abuse (DIAAA)** - For livers that look like raisins
- **Decentralized Institute on Drug Abuse (DIDA)** - For brains that need better hobbies

**The "Nobody Cares Until It's You" Department:**

- **Decentralized Institute of Rare Diseases** - For conditions affecting 12 people worldwide
- **Decentralized Institute on Minority Health (DIMHD)** - For diseases that discriminate

**The "Should Have Fixed This By Now" Bureau:**

- **Decentralized Institute of Infectious Diseases (DIAID)** - For germs humanity can't kill yet
- **Decentralized Institute of Environmental Health (DIEHS)** - For poisons humanity keeps making

Governance for each institute is fluid and decentralized, managed by the stakeholders (patients, researchers) who are actively participating in that disease area. They can collectively decide to fund shared infrastructure, post bounties, and coordinate research efforts using the tools provided by the DIH platform.

## Structure the Money Flow: From Treaties to Treatments

### Step 1: Set Up the Treasury (And Make It Unstealable)

Route $27 billion into the DIH treasury every year. Structure this as the world's largest clinical trial insurance fund.

**How Normal Insurance Works:**

- You pay premiums
- You get sick
- Insurance maybe covers treatment
- You still die because the treatment doesn't exist

**How to Structure DIH Trial Insurance:**

- Let the 1% Treaty fund the premiums
- When patients get sick
- Cover their experimental treatments
- Charge a $20-50 copay
- They might actually live
- Their data helps the next patient

It's insurance, but for treatments that don't exist yet.

**How Normal Organizations Allocate Budgets:**

- Politicians horse-trade in back rooms
- Lobbyists bribe everyone
- The disease with the best PR wins
- Actual sick people are ignored

**How DIH Allocates Its Budget**

The DIH Treasury is governed by Wishocracy, the global voting system detailed in the outline. Millions of participants vote on high-level budget allocations, not specific trials.

A typical Wishocracy vote might look like this:

- "Allocate 70% to Patient Subsidies vs. 15% to dFDA Protocol Development"
- "Allocate 10% to Expansion Campaigns (The 2% Treaty) vs. 5% for Research Prizes"

This process happens continuously, creating a transparent and democratically controlled budget. The core principle is to direct the vast majority of funds to patients, empowering them to make the final choice on which research gets funded.

### Step 2: Empower Patients with Subsidies

The largest portion of the DIH budget flows directly to patients as subsidies, which they use to join trials on the dFDA platform. This is how the DIH's broad budget categories are translated into funding for specific disease areas.

- If more patients join cancer trials, the "Decentralized Cancer Institute" organically receives more funding.
- If a new breakthrough in mental health appears, patient demand will automatically shift resources to the "Decentralized Institute of Mental Health."

The institutes don't have fixed budgets; their funding is a real-time reflection of patient needs and scientific progress. They are coordination hubs, not bureaucratic gatekeepers.

### Step 3: Enforce the Rules with Code

The budget allocations decided by Wishocracy are enforced by smart contracts. These are simple, transparent programs that automate the flow of funds and can't be bribed or altered.

Key rules enforced by code:

- **Treasury Allocation:** Automatically distribute funds to the Patient Subsidy pool, dFDA development bounties, etc., according to the real-time results of Wishocracy votes.
- **Milestone Payments:** For prizes or infrastructure projects, funds are released automatically when predefined goals are met.
- **Radical Transparency:** Every transaction is public, creating a permanent, auditable record of how every dollar is spent.

This automated enforcement minimizes the need for administrators, reduces the potential for corruption, and ensures the will of the voters is carried out precisely.

## Build the Clinical Trial Insurance Revolution: Cover Patient Experiments

Here's the most insane part of current medical research: sick people PAY to be guinea pigs.

You have cancer. A trial might cure you. To join, you need:

- $5,000 for travel to the trial site
- $10,000 in lost wages
- $3,000 for hotels
- $2,000 for someone to watch your kids
- Your house as collateral for the medical bills

It's like charging people admission to their own rescue.

### Structure the DIH as Clinical Trial Insurance

Make the DIH function like an insurance company that covers experimental treatments. Here's how to structure it:

**Make DIH Cover These (100%):**

- All trial medications
- Required testing and monitoring
- Travel expenses (if they must travel)
- Lost wage compensation
- Childcare during treatment
- Any trial-related complications

**Structure Patient Costs:**

- Small copay: $20-50/month
- Time to report outcomes (5 minutes/week)
- Commitment to complete the trial

**Design the Access Flow:**

1. Doctor recommends a trial (like prescribing any treatment)
2. DIH pre-approves coverage (instant, algorithmic)
3. Patient gets a DIH insurance card
4. Pharmacy fills trial meds like normal prescriptions
5. Patient pays copay
6. Patient reports outcomes via app

It's not "paying patients" - it's covering their costs so they can participate without going bankrupt.

**Build the Algorithm of Life (Literally):**

Design patient subsidies using a transparent algorithm that a 5th grader could understand:

1. **How Much Will This Disease Kill You?**

   - Pancreatic cancer (kills everyone quickly) = $$$$$
   - Male pattern baldness (kills nobody ever) = $
   
2. **How Promising Is the Treatment?**

   - Novel mechanism never tried = $$$$$
   - Another me-too drug = $

3. **How Badly Does Pharma Ignore This?**

   - Rare disease affecting 12 people = $$$$$
   - Erectile dysfunction = $ (they've got this covered)

4. **Will Normal People Afford the Cure?**

   - Generic drug that costs $5 = $$$$$
   - Gene therapy that costs $2 million = $

**Real Examples:**

- Testing metformin for cancer: $5,000 per patient (cheap drug, huge potential)
- Testing gold-plated gene therapy: $100 per patient (only rich people will afford it anyway)
- Testing prayer: $0 (but the system will track the results for science)

The algorithm is public. The code is open source. Unlike the NIH's funding formula, which was apparently written by a drunk wizard in 1953 and never updated.

---

## The Transparent Research Marketplace: Finally, Scientists Can Find Each Other

Here's a fun fact: Right now, there are probably 17 teams working on the exact same cancer cure, and none of them know the others exist.

The NIH doesn't track this. Why would they? It's only a catastrophic waste of human life and money.

### The Problem: Everyone's Reinventing the Same Wheel (While People Die)

**Current System:**

- Dr. Smith in Boston is testing Drug X for Disease Y
- Dr. Jones in Seattle is testing Drug X for Disease Y  
- Dr. Lee in Houston is testing Drug X for Disease Y
- They'll discover each other in 5 years at a conference
- After they've each spent $10 million
- And recruited the same 1,000 patients
- Who could have been testing 3 different drugs
- But weren't
- Because nobody talks to anybody
- So people died
- The end

### Build the DIH Solution: A Search Engine for "Who's Working on Not Killing People"

Build ONE system where EVERYTHING is visible:

**The Universal Research Catalog** (Revolutionary Features):

- Every trial, everywhere, updated in real-time
- Every researcher, what they're doing, how it's going
- Every failure (because negative results save lives too)
- Every dataset (because hoarding data kills people)
- Everything searchable by anyone
- For free
- Forever

**The AI Matchmaker** (Like Tinder, But for Saving Lives):

- "Hey Dr. Smith, Dr. Jones is doing the exact same thing"
- "Maybe you should, I don't know, TALK TO EACH OTHER"
- "Or combine your studies and test twice as fast"
- "Or test different doses and share the data"
- "Just a thought from your friendly neighborhood AI"

**Automatic Collaboration Detection:**

- AI spots overlapping research BEFORE you waste money
- Suggests how teams could combine efforts
- Identifies gaps nobody's working on
- Finds patients for trials in seconds, not years
- Does all this while you sleep
- Never asks for a raise

Example: 

- 10 teams testing the same drug separately = 10 years, $100 million
- 10 teams coordinating through the marketplace = 2 years, $10 million
- Math even a congressman could understand

## Structure Research Funding Without Grant Applications

The NIH grant application is 100 pages long. It takes 6 months to write. It has a 10% success rate.

Make the DIH application 0 pages long. It takes 0 months to write. It has a 100% success rate.

How? Don't fund promises. Fund results.

### Set Up Three Ways to Get DIH Money

#### 1. Post Problem Bounties, Pay Winners

Post bounties like the world's most helpful mob:

- "$50 million for reversing aging in mice by 2 years"
- "$10 million for cure that works on Tuesday"
- "$100 million for making cancer cells explode (safely)"

Someone solves it, they get paid. No applications. No committees. No bullshit.

**Who Decides What Problems to Post?**

The community does. Patients, doctors, and researchers within each emergent disease institute can propose and fund bounties. They use transparent data and decision-making tools, not closed-door committees.

**How Bounties are Prioritized:**

1.  **Proposal:** Any member of a disease community can propose a bounty (e.g., "$50M for a functional cure for Type 1 Diabetes").
2.  **Scoping & Feasibility:** The community, aided by AI tools, assesses the proposal's feasibility, potential impact (QALYs saved), and cost. This is a transparent discussion, not a back-room review.
3.  **Funding:** The institute can vote to allocate a portion of its emergent funds (from patient trial participation) to the bounty prize.

**The Decentralized Peer Review** (Like Regular Peer Review, But Honest):

Instead of the same 5 guys reviewing everything:

- Algorithm picks reviewers based on actual expertise
- Reviewers don't know whose work they're reviewing (no buddy system)
- Reviews happen in parallel, not sequential (weeks, not years)
- Reviewers get PAID (revolutionary concept)
- Bad reviewers get kicked out by algorithm (not protected by tenure)
- Everything published publicly (radical transparency)

Example Review Timeline:

- NIH: 9 months, 3 reviewers, 90% politics
- DIH: 3 weeks, 20 reviewers, 0% politics, 100% "will this work?"

**Why This Works:** Instead of paying people to TALK about solving problems, pay them AFTER they solve them. It's capitalism, but pointed at human survival.

#### 2. Post Micro-Bounties for Micro-Progress

Not everything needs to cure cancer completely. Also pay for small wins:

- "$100K for software that matches patients to trials in 10 seconds"
- "$50K for algorithm that predicts drug interactions"
- "$25K for making trial consent forms readable by humans"
- "$10K for website that doesn't look like it's from 1997"

It's like Uber, but for incremental medical progress.

#### 3. Fund Infrastructure Automatically

Some things just need to exist, even if they're boring:

- Servers that don't crash
- Databases that actually connect
- Security that keeps China from stealing everything
- Coffee for the people maintaining all this

Fund these automatically, no applications required. If people are keeping the lights on, pay them. Novel concept.

## Build Governance: Democracy Without the Stupidity

The NIH is run by whoever the President appoints, usually someone who donated enough money or married the right person.

Run the DIH with math instead.

### Build the Technology Stack: A Government That Can't Be Corrupted

The NIH runs on:

- Paper (mostly)
- Fax machines (yes, really)
- Email systems from 1995
- Excel spreadsheets that crash
- Dreams and good intentions

Build the DIH on technology that actually works:

**Use Blockchain** (A Database That Can't Lie):

- Record every transaction forever
- Track every vote publicly
- Make every dollar traceable
- Keep every decision transparent
- Politicians hate it (good sign)

**Implement Zero-Knowledge Proofs** (Privacy Without Secrets):

- Analyze health data without seeing it
- Prove results without revealing patients
- It's like magic, but it's just math
- Protects privacy while advancing science
- Makes HIPAA look like a joke (which it is)

**Build a Universal API** (Everything Talks to Everything):

- Let any app connect
- Let any device contribute data
- Let any researcher access tools
- It's like the internet, but for not dying
- No proprietary bullshit

**Deploy AI Agents That Never Sleep:**

- **Research Matcher**: Set it to find duplicate studies in milliseconds
- **Patient Finder**: Have it match patients to trials instantly
- **Fraud Detector**: Train it to spot fake data before publication
- **Result Tracker**: Program it to monitor real-world outcomes forever
- **Budget Guard**: Use it to prevent administrators from existing

**Open Source Everything:**
Instead of every nonprofit building their own shitty systems, provide:

- Free donor management (better than Salesforce)
- Free trial management (better than Oracle)
- Free accounting (better than QuickBooks)
- Free everything (better than bankruptcy)
- Save millions that can go to actual research

Example: The American Cancer Society spends $50 million annually on IT. Under DIH, they spend $0 and get better tools. That's $50 million more for curing cancer.

### Smart Contracts: The Incorruptible Bureaucrats

Most DIH operations are run by smart contracts - computer programs that can't be bribed, don't take vacations, and never ask for promotions.

**What Humans Do:**

- Decide what to cure
- Set priorities
- Argue on Twitter

**What Robots Do:**

- Move money
- Enforce rules
- Track results
- Prevent theft
- Never sleep
- Never complain

**The Beautiful Features:**

- **Time Locks**: Big transfers wait 72 hours (in case someone's stealing)
- **Spending Limits**: Can't drain the treasury in one day (history teaches this lesson)
- **Automatic Audits**: Every penny tracked forever (goodbye, Pentagon accounting)
- **Milestone Payments**: Money releases when you hit goals, not before
- **Public Everything**: All transactions visible (radical transparency, terrifying honesty)

It's like having the world's most honest accountant who works for free and can't be murdered.

## Design Incentives That Actually Work: The Psychology of Proper Motivation

### The NIH Incentive Structure (Designed by Satan):

**Researchers are rewarded for:**

- Writing grants (not doing research)
- Publishing papers (even if wrong)
- Getting tenure (then doing nothing)
- Building big labs (mini-empires)
- Never taking risks (safety first, progress never)

**Patients are rewarded for:**

- Nothing
- Actually, they pay to participate
- Then they die

**Administrators are rewarded for:**

- Creating more administration
- Hiring more administrators
- Making everything take longer
- Using all the budget (or losing it next year)
- Never being responsible for anything

### Design the DIH Incentive Structure (For Humans):

**Reward researchers for:**

- Solving problems (novel concept)
- Sharing data (radical transparency)
- Taking smart risks (innovation!)
- Collaborating (cooperation beats competition)
- Actually curing things (the point of all this)

**Reward patients for:**

- Participating in trials (money!)
- Sharing their data (more money!)
- Not dying (priceless!)
- Rating treatments (like Consumer Reports but important)
- Helping others with their disease (community!)

**Reward administrators for:**

- Automating administrative tasks to maximize efficiency
- Making things faster
- Spending less
- Disappearing

## Run These Scenarios: What $27 Billion Actually Buys

### Scenario 1: Launch the Cancer Moon Shot (But Real This Time)

Give the Decentralized Cancer Institute $4 billion annually.

**How the NIH Would Spend It:**

- $2 billion on administration
- $1 billion on buildings
- $500 million on conferences in nice places
- $500 million on actual research
- Result: 3 new treatments in 10 years

**How to Structure DCI Spending:**

- $2 billion on patient subsidies (400,000 patients in trials)
- $1 billion on result prizes (50 major breakthroughs)
- $500 million on micro-bounties (5,000 small innovations)
- $500 million on infrastructure (that actually works)
- Result: 50+ new treatments in 2 years

### Scenario 2: Start the Rare Disease Revolution

5,000 rare diseases. Zero treatments. Why? No money in it.

**Current System:**
"Sorry, your disease only affects 100 people. Have you tried not having it?"

**Structure the DIH System:**

- Give each rare disease its own DAO
- Let patients pool resources
- Add global subsidy pool funds
- Have researchers compete for bounties
- Result: Every disease gets attention

Example: Exploding Kidney Syndrome (37 patients worldwide)

- Patient DAO pools: $37,000
- DIH matching fund adds: $3.7 million
- Post bounty: "Cure Exploding Kidneys, Win $3.7 Million"
- 17 research teams compete
- Someone wins in 18 months
- Kidneys stop exploding

### Scenario 3: Launch the Aging Reversal Project

Allocate $3 billion to the Decentralized Institute on Aging.

Instead of studying why old people fall down, post this bounty:

**"$1 BILLION PRIZE: Reverse Human Aging by 10 Years"**

Set these requirements:

- Must work on actual humans (not just rich mice)
- Must be measurable (not just "feeling younger")
- Must be affordable (not just for billionaires)
- Must not turn people into vampires (important)

Result: Every anti-aging researcher on Earth suddenly very motivated.

### Year 5: The New Normal

Achieve:
- DIH model copied by Europe, Asia
- Rare diseases start getting cured monthly
- Cancer death rate drops 30%
- Mental health crisis actually addressed
- Big Pharma pivots to bounty hunting

### Year 10: The Golden Age

Reach:
- Most diseases have treatments
- Death becomes increasingly optional
- Healthcare costs plummet
- Humans live to 150, complain about it
- NIH converted to medical history museum



---

## Why This Will Actually Happen

The NIH won't reform itself. Bureaucracies never do. They grow until they consume everything or get replaced by something that works.

The DIH isn't reform. It's replacement.

Don't try to fix the grant system. Make it obsolete.

Don't try to improve committees. Eliminate them.

Don't try to streamline bureaucracy. Automate it out of existence.

The NIH will fight this. They'll claim:

- "It's too risky!" (Says the system that takes 17 years to approve anything)
- "Patients can't make decisions!" (Says the system that excludes 85% of patients)
- "We need oversight!" (Says the system that lost $2.5 trillion)
- "Think of the safety!" (Says the system killing 120,000 people per decade)

But math doesn't care about their objections. Results don't care about their committees. And dying people definitely don't care about their paperwork.

---

## The Bottom Line: Bureaucracy Is a Disease, and Here's the Cure

The NIH is a $47 billion machine for preventing medical progress while looking important.

The DIH is a $27 billion machine for curing diseases while eliminating middlemen.

One system pays researchers to write about maybe possibly potentially considering thinking about perhaps doing research someday if the committee approves.

The other system pays people who solve problems.

One system takes 17 years and $2.2 billion to develop one treatment.

The other system takes 2 years and $27 million.

One system is run by politicians and bureaucrats.

The other system is run by patients and code.

It's not even a competition. It's evolution. The dinosaurs don't know the meteor has already hit.

The beautiful part? You don't need permission to build this. You don't need Congress to approve. You don't need the NIH to agree.

You just need the 1% Treaty to pass, the money to flow, and the smart contracts to execute.
