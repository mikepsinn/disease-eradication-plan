### The Problem: The NIH is a Disease

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is [a $47 billion machine](../references.qmd#nih-budget-fy2025) designed to prevent medical progress. [It employs two administrators for every one scientist](../references.qmd#nih-admin-to-scientist-ratio)—like having two managers for every McDonald's fry cook, except the fries cure cancer and the managers prevent them from being made. It rewards grant writing, not research. It forces scientists to [spend months writing](../references.qmd#grant-writing-time-50pct) 100-page proposals that include their blood type, only to be rejected because the NIH's funding formula was apparently written by a drunk wizard in 1953.

[By the time a good idea gets funded](../references.qmd#nih-first-r01-age-45), the lead scientist is dead or the disease has evolved thumbs.

Bureaucracy is a disease. The [DIH](../solution/dih.qmd) is the cure.

### How to Build a Medical Research System That Works

You don't fix the NIH; you replace it. The Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) is what you build when you want to cure diseases instead of writing papers about them. You build it on four principles that invert the logic of bureaucracy.

**1. Make Patient Choice Sovereign.**
You stop letting committees guess what might work and instead route funding through the people who are actually sick. The NIH has 200 bureaucrats in a room trying to predict the future; the DIH has millions of patients and their doctors making choices about their own lives. The treasury gives subsidies directly to patients, who fund trials with their feet. The trials that attract patients get money. The ones that don't, die. You have just replaced a grant-writing contest with a market driven by patient need.

**2. Pay for Cures, Not Paperwork.**
You eliminate grant applications entirely. Researchers get paid in two ways: by patients who join their trials, and by massive [bounties](../solution/bounties.qmd) for solving clearly defined problems (e.g., "$1B to reverse aging by 10 years, provided it doesn't turn people into vampires"). You align their incentives with patient outcomes, not bureaucratic process. They get rich by curing diseases, not by writing fiction.

**3. Run It With Code, Not Committees.**
You build the DIH on transparent, auditable smart contracts because code can't take bribes. You delete the CEO position entirely—nobody to corrupt means nobody gets corrupted. Every rule is code. Every dollar is tracked on a public ledger like a financial colonoscopy for the world to watch. This isn't about trusting people to be good (they won't be); it's about designing a system where being bad is mathematically impossible. You replace bureaucrats with software, and the primary job of any remaining administrator is to code themselves out of a job—like building your own executioner.

**4. Make All Knowledge Public.**
You mandate that [every trial, every result (positive or negative), and every dataset is published](../references.qmd#publication-bias-clinical-trials) for the world to see. This stops scientists from wasting decades on redundant research and allows knowledge to compound. AI agents can then scan the global data stream to connect researchers, find patterns, and accelerate discovery for everyone.

### How You Fund It: The 3-Step Flow

1.  **You Fill the Treasury.** You use [The 1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) to redirect a rounding error from global military spending—$27 billion—into the DIH treasury.

2.  **You Let Humanity Set the Rules.** A global population of voters uses [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) to set the high-level budget. They don't pick specific trials. They vote on rules like, "Allocate 70% of the treasury to Patient Subsidies" and "Allocate 5% to Research Prizes."

3.  **You Let Patients Fund Cures.** The treasury flows to patients as subsidies. This creates a vibrant, competitive marketplace where the best research attracts funding directly from the people who need it most.

### How You Fund the Big Stuff: Emergent Institutes

A marketplace of individual patients is powerful, but it won't fund the massive projects that benefit everyone. No single patient will use their subsidy to fund a **$1 billion prize to reverse aging** or a **shared data platform for all cancer researchers.**

These "public goods" are the difference between curing cancer and arguing about it on Twitter. This is where you introduce **emergent institutes.**

These aren't bureaucracies; they are tools for collective investment that arise from the community itself—like the Decentralized Cancer Institute ("For cells that forgot how to die") or the Decentralized Institute of Mental Health ("For brains that hate their owners"). When a community directs billions into trials, you give them tools to pool a tiny fraction of that flow. This allows them to collectively post massive prizes and fund shared infrastructure—the kinds of breakthrough projects a pure marketplace would ignore.

This is how you fund not just thousands of individual trials, but the entire ecosystem of innovation.

### How You Build the Machine: The Legal and Financial Engine

You don't just need a plan; you need a vehicle. The DIH is a hybrid system designed to use the tools of capitalism to build a post-capitalist health economy. It unfolds in three phases.

**Phase 0: The Seed**
Before you can raise a billion dollars, you need gas money. You start by establishing a **U.S.-based 501(c)(3) non-profit**. This is the legal entity that can accept initial, tax-deductible seed grants from foundations. Its mission is purely charitable: education, research, and building the public technology platforms.

This seed funding is used to pay for the legal and operational setup of two additional, separate entities:

*   A **501(c)(4) Social Welfare Organization** to handle direct political lobbying for the [1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd).
*   A **For-Profit Company** to raise the investment capital needed to fund the entire operation.

Using 501(c)(3) funds to create these entities is perfectly legal and completely necessary. The non-profit's mission is to end disease. Since it can't legally bribe politicians itself (that's what the 501(c)(4) is for), and can't sell bonds to defense contractors (that's the for-profit's job), it births these specialized vehicles like a spider laying eggs that will eat the healthcare system from within.

**Phase 1: The Three-Pronged Attack**
With the legal groundwork laid, you launch a coordinated campaign across the three entities, each with a specific role:

1.  **The 501(c)(3) Public Charity:** Focuses on education, building a coalition of non-profit partners, and developing the open-source dFDA and Wishocracy platforms as a public good. It is funded by tax-deductible grants.
2.  **The 501(c)(4) Social Welfare Org:** Executes the aggressive lobbying and political campaign to pass the [1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd). It is funded by non-deductible donations from those who want to directly support the political fight.
3.  **The For-Profit Company:** Raises the **$1 billion war chest** by selling [VICTORY Bonds](../appendix/victory-bonds.qmd) to investors. This capital is then used to grant funds to the (c)(3) and (c)(4) to scale their operations into a global movement.

**Phase 2: The Swiss Bank Account (But Legal)**
Once the treaty is signed, the $27 billion in annual funding flows into a **Swiss foundation**—because if you're going to store humanity's medical future somewhere, might as well use the country that stayed neutral through two world wars and makes excellent chocolate. This treasury is completely separated from the initial entities (lawyers call this a "firewall," normal people call it "keeping the money where the lobbyists can't touch it"). It pays the investors their blood money and dumps the rest into actually curing diseases.

**The Full Value Flow**
Here's how the entire system is designed to be self-sustaining and capture-proof:

graph TD
    subgraph "Phase 0: Seed Funding"
        A[Foundations & Donors] -- Seed Grants --> B{US 501(c)(3)};
        B -- Funds --> C[Legal Setup for All Entities];
    end

    subgraph "Phase 1: Capitalization & Campaign"
        C --> D{For-Profit Co.}
        C --> E{501(c)(4) Lobbying}
        C --> F{501(c)(3) Education/Tech}

        G[Investors] -- $1B War Chest --> D;
        H[Donors] -- Non-deductible --> E;
        A -- Tax-deductible --> F;
        
        D -- Grants --> E;
        D -- Grants --> F;

        E -- Political Campaign --> I[1% Treaty];
        F -- Public Education --> I;
    end
    
    subgraph "Phase 2: Ongoing Funding Cycle"
        J[Governments] -- Sign --> I;
        I -- $27B/year --> K{Swiss Foundation (DIH Treasury)};
        K -- 10% of inflows --> G;
        K -- 90% of inflows --> L[Patient Subsidies & Research Bounties];
        L --> M[Researchers & Clinical Trials];
        M -- Cures & Data --> N[Humanity];
    end
```

This structure uses capitalism's own weapons against it—like convincing a vampire to donate blood. The greedy parts stay greedy (but productively so), while the humanitarian parts stay pure (but funded).

### The Result: A Revolution in Medicine

This model isn't an improvement. It's a phase change.

*   **[80X More Efficient](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-82x-cost-reduction):** You test 54 million patient-treatments for the same cost [the NIH uses to test 658,000](../references.qmd#nih-patient-treatments-tested).
*   **10X Faster:** You get treatments to patients in 2-3 years, not [17](../references.qmd#research-to-practice-gap).
*   **100% Transparent:** Every success and failure becomes public knowledge, accelerating progress for all.

You replace a system that values paperwork with one that values not dying. This is what happens when you stop asking permission from people who profit from your sickness. Soon, humans will live to 150, and they'll complain about having to update their passwords for that long.
