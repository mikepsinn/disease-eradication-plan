### The Problem: The NIH is a Disease

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is [a $47 billion machine](../references.qmd#nih-budget-fy2025) designed to prevent medical progress. [It employs two administrators for every one scientist](../references.qmd#nih-admin-to-scientist-ratio)—like having two managers for every McDonald's fry cook, except the fries cure cancer and the managers prevent them from being made. It rewards grant writing, not research. It forces scientists to [spend months writing](../references.qmd#grant-writing-time-50pct) 100-page proposals that include their blood type, only to be rejected because the NIH's funding formula was apparently written by a drunk wizard in 1953.

[By the time a good idea gets funded](../references.qmd#nih-first-r01-age-45), the lead scientist is dead or the disease has evolved thumbs.

Bureaucracy is a disease. The [DIH](../solution/dih.qmd) is the cure.

### How to Build a Medical Research System That Works

You don't fix the NIH; you replace it. The Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) is what you build when you want to cure diseases instead of writing papers about them. You build it on four principles that invert the logic of bureaucracy.

**1. Make Patient Choice Sovereign.**
You stop letting committees guess what might work and instead route funding through the people who are actually sick. The NIH has 200 bureaucrats in a room trying to predict the future; the DIH has millions of patients and their doctors making choices about their own lives. The treasury gives subsidies directly to patients, who fund trials with their feet. The trials that attract patients get money. The ones that don't, die. You have just replaced a grant-writing contest with a market driven by patient need.

**2. Pay for Cures, Not Paperwork.**
You eliminate grant applications entirely. Researchers get paid in two ways: by patients who join their trials, and by massive [bounties](../solution/bounties.qmd) for solving clearly defined problems (e.g., "$1B to reverse aging by 10 years, provided it doesn't turn people into vampires"). You align their incentives with patient outcomes, not bureaucratic process. They get rich by curing diseases, not by writing fiction.

**3. Run It With Code, Not Committees.**
You build the DIH on transparent, auditable smart contracts because code can't take bribes. You delete the CEO position because there's nothing to corrupt. Every rule is code. Every dollar is tracked on a public ledger. This isn't about trusting people to be good; it's about designing a system where they can't be bad. You replace bureaucrats with software, and the primary job of any remaining administrator is to automate themselves out of existence.

**4. Make All Knowledge Public.**
You mandate that [every trial, every result (positive or negative), and every dataset is published](../references.qmd#publication-bias-clinical-trials) for the world to see. This stops scientists from wasting decades on redundant research and allows knowledge to compound. AI agents can then scan the global data stream to connect researchers, find patterns, and accelerate discovery for everyone.

### How You Fund It: The 3-Step Flow

1.  **You Fill the Treasury.** You use [The 1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) to redirect a rounding error from global military spending—$27 billion—into the DIH treasury.

2.  **You Let Humanity Set the Rules.** A global population of voters uses [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) to set the high-level budget. They don't pick specific trials. They vote on rules like, "Allocate 70% of the treasury to Patient Subsidies" and "Allocate 5% to Research Prizes."

3.  **You Let Patients Fund Cures.** The treasury flows to patients as subsidies. This creates a vibrant, competitive marketplace where the best research attracts funding directly from the people who need it most.

### How You Fund the Big Stuff: Emergent Institutes

A marketplace of individual patients is powerful, but it won't fund the massive projects that benefit everyone. No single patient will use their subsidy to fund a **$1 billion prize to reverse aging** or a **shared data platform for all cancer researchers.**

These "public goods" are game-changers. This is where you introduce **emergent institutes.**

These aren't bureaucracies; they are tools for collective investment that arise from the community itself—like the Decentralized Cancer Institute ("For cells that forgot how to die") or the Decentralized Institute of Mental Health ("For brains that hate their owners"). When a community directs billions into trials, you give them tools to pool a tiny fraction of that flow. This allows them to collectively post massive prizes and fund shared infrastructure—the kinds of breakthrough projects a pure marketplace would ignore.

This is how you fund not just thousands of individual trials, but the entire ecosystem of innovation.

### How You Build the Machine: The Legal and Financial Engine

You don't just need a plan; you need a vehicle. The DIH is a hybrid system designed to use the tools of capitalism to build a post-capitalist health economy. It unfolds in three phases.

**Phase 0: The Seed**
Before you can raise a billion-dollar war chest, you need gas money. You start by establishing a **U.S.-based 501(c)(3) non-profit**. This is the legal entity that can accept initial, tax-deductible seed grants from foundations and early believers. The goal of this seed funding isn't to boil the ocean; it's to fund the essentials required to get to the next stage:
*   **Legal Architecture:** Paying the lawyers to set up the for-profit entity and the Swiss foundation.
*   **The Investment Case:** Building the materials and financial models for the [VICTORY Bonds](../appendix/victory-bonds.qmd).
*   **Core Team:** Assembling the initial operators to run the campaign.

And yes, using non-profit funds to create a for-profit entity is perfectly legal when it's the most effective tool to achieve the charitable mission. The 501(c)(3)'s mission is to end disease. Since it can't legally engage in the massive political lobbying required to pass the treaty, it funds the creation of a separate vehicle that *can*. It's not a conflict of interest; it's a strategic necessity. The for-profit is a weapon built by the non-profit to fight the war.

This non-profit is the bootstrap loader for the entire system. It's the spark that lights the fuse.

**Phase 1: The For-Profit Engine**
With the legal groundwork laid, you launch the for-profit vehicle to raise a **$1 billion war chest** from investors. This isn't a charity; it's a high-risk, high-return investment in political and social change. This capital is used for three things:
*   **Fund the Campaign:** A global media and lobbying effort to get the [1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) signed.
*   **Build the Platform:** The software for the [dFDA](../solution/dfda.qmd) and [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd).
*   **Cover Operations:** The administrative and technical costs to get the system running.

**Phase 2: The Non-Profit Treasury**
Once the treaty is signed, the $27 billion in annual funding flows into a **Swiss foundation**. This non-profit structure ensures the funds are managed transparently and used solely for their intended purpose: funding research and patient subsidies. It's legally firewalled from the for-profit engine and its investors, allowing it to accept treaty funds and donations without compromising the political action needed to create it.

**The Full Value Flow**
Here's how the entire system is designed to be self-sustaining and capture-proof:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Phase 0: Seed Funding"
        A[Foundations & Donors] -- Seed Grants --> B{US 501(c)(3)};
        B -- Funds --> C[Legal & For-Profit Setup];
    end

    subgraph "Phase 1: Capitalization"
        C --> D{For-Profit Vehicle};
        E[Investors] -- $1B War Chest --> D;
        D -- Funds --> F[Lobbying & Referendum for 1% Treaty];
        D -- Funds --> G[Platform Development (dFDA, Wishocracy)];
    end
    
    subgraph "Phase 2: Ongoing Funding Cycle"
        H[Governments] -- Sign --> I[1% Treaty];
        I -- $27B/year --> J{Swiss Foundation (DIH Treasury)};
        J -- 10% of inflows --> E;
        J -- 90% of inflows --> K[Patient Subsidies & Research Bounties];
        K --> L[Researchers & Clinical Trials];
        L -- Cures & Data --> M[Humanity];
    end
```

This structure separates the political and financial risk (the for-profit side) from the scientific and humanitarian mission (the non-profit side). It uses capitalism to build a system that transcends it.

### The Result: A Revolution in Medicine

This model isn't an improvement. It's a phase change.

*   **[80X More Efficient](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-82x-cost-reduction):** You test 54 million patient-treatments for the same cost [the NIH uses to test 658,000](../references.qmd#nih-patient-treatments-tested).
*   **10X Faster:** You get treatments to patients in 2-3 years, not [17](../references.qmd#research-to-practice-gap).
*   **100% Transparent:** Every success and failure becomes public knowledge, accelerating progress for all.

You replace a system that values process with one that values results. This is what happens when you stop asking for permission and start curing diseases. Soon, humans will live to 150, and they'll probably complain about that, too.
