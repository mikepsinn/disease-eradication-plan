### The Problem: The NIH is a Disease

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is [a $47 billion machine](../references.qmd#nih-budget-fy2025) designed to prevent medical progress. [It employs two administrators for every one scientist](../references.qmd#nih-admin-to-scientist-ratio)—like having two managers for every McDonald's fry cook, except the fries cure cancer and the managers prevent them from being made. It rewards grant writing, not research. It forces scientists to [spend months writing](../references.qmd#grant-writing-time-50pct) 100-page proposals that include their blood type, only to be rejected because the NIH's funding formula was apparently written by a drunk wizard in 1953.

[By the time a good idea gets funded](../references.qmd#nih-first-r01-age-45), the lead scientist is dead or the disease has evolved thumbs.

Bureaucracy is a disease. The [DIH](../solution/dih.qmd) is the cure.

### The Solution: A System That Actually Works

The Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) is what happens when you design a medical research system while sober. It is not a better version of the NIH; it is the opposite. It is built on four simple principles designed to deliver more cures, faster, for less money.

**1. Patient Choice is Sovereign.**
The system is funded by one source: sick people paying for trials that might save their lives. The DIH treasury provides patients with subsidies. Patients, in consultation with their doctors, choose which trials to join. The trials that attract the most patients get the most funding. There are no committees, no grant applications, and no gatekeepers.

**2. Pay for Results, Not Promises.**
The DIH has no grant applications. Researchers get paid in two ways:
*   **By Patients:** For running trials that patients want to join.
*   **By Bounties:** For solving clearly defined problems (e.g., "$1B to reverse aging by 10 years, provided it doesn't turn people into vampires").
This aligns incentives completely. Researchers are rewarded for creating value and solving problems, not for writing paperwork.

**3. Automate Everything, Trust No One.**
The DIH is run by code, not people. All rules are enforced by transparent, auditable smart contracts. Every dollar is tracked on a public ledger. This minimizes corruption, eliminates administrative waste, and ensures the system operates exactly as designed. Software replaces bureaucrats; the primary incentive for any remaining administrator is to disappear.

**4. Radical Transparency.**
[Every trial, every result (positive or negative), and every dataset is published](../references.qmd#publication-bias-clinical-trials) for the world to see. This stops redundant research, accelerates discovery, and allows knowledge to compound. AI agents monitor the public data to connect researchers, spot opportunities, and prevent waste.

### How It Works: The 3-Step Flow of Funds

1.  **The Treasury is Filled.** [The 1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) redirects $27 billion in global military spending into the DIH treasury.

2.  **Wishocracy Sets the Rules.** A global population of voters uses [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) to set the high-level budget. They don't pick specific trials. They vote on rules like, "Allocate 70% of the treasury to Patient Subsidies" and "Allocate 5% to Research Prizes."

3.  **Patients Fund Cures.** The vast majority of the treasury flows to patients as subsidies. This creates a vibrant, competitive marketplace where the best research attracts the most funding directly from the people who need it most.

### The Essential Role of Institutes

A marketplace of individual patients is powerful, but it can't fund the massive projects that benefit an entire disease community. No single patient will use their subsidy to fund a **$1 billion prize to reverse aging** or a **shared data platform for all cancer researchers.**

These "public goods" are game-changers.

This is the sole function of **emergent institutes**—like the Decentralized Cancer Institute ("For cells that forgot how to die") or the Decentralized Institute of Mental Health ("For brains that hate their owners"). They are not bureaucracies; they are tools for collective investment. When a community directs billions into trials, the DIH platform gives them tools to pool a tiny fraction of that flow. They can collectively post massive prizes and fund shared infrastructure—the kinds of breakthrough projects a pure marketplace would ignore.

The institutes are the feature that allows us to fund not just thousands of individual trials, but the entire ecosystem of innovation.

### The Result: A Revolution in Medicine

This model isn't a small improvement. It's a phase change.

*   **[80X More Efficient](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-82x-cost-reduction):** Test 54 million patient-treatments for the same cost [the NIH uses to test 658,000](../references.qmd#nih-patient-treatments-tested).
*   **10X Faster:** Get treatments to patients in 2-3 years, not [17](../references.qmd#research-to-practice-gap).
*   **100% Transparent:** Every success and failure is public knowledge, accelerating progress for all.

The DIH replaces a system that values process with one that values results. It's what happens when you stop asking for permission and start curing diseases. Soon, humans will live to 150, and they'll probably complain about that, too.
