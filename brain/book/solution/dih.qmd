## The Optimization Problem

A superintelligent economist designing a medical research system would start with a simple objective function:

**Maximize:** Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) gained globally
**Minimize:** Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and cost per QALY
**Subject to:** Incentive compatibility, strategy-proofness, and resistance to regulatory capture

But the real breakthrough is simpler than optimization theory. It's this:

**Pay researchers for success, not for asking permission.**

**NIH model:** Pay for grant applications, publications, credentials
**DIH model:** Pay for QALYs produced, patients helped, problems solved

The NIH currently produces QALYs at [an estimated cost of $50,000-$150,000 per QALY](../references.qmd#nih-cost-per-qaly)—far above the theoretical optimum. Through mechanism design alone, the DIH can achieve 10-100x efficiency gains. Not through better scientists or more funding, but through **pure institutional architecture**.

This isn't utopian dreaming. It's applied game theory.

## The Problem: The NIH as an Accidentally Optimized DALY Maximization Machine

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is [a $47 billion machine](../references.qmd#nih-budget-fy2025) designed to prevent medical progress. [It employs two administrators for every one scientist](../references.qmd#nih-admin-to-scientist-ratio)—like having two managers for every McDonald's fry cook, except the fries cure cancer and the managers prevent them from being made. It rewards grant writing, not research. It forces scientists to [spend months writing](../references.qmd#grant-writing-time-50pct) 100-page proposals that include their blood type, only to be rejected because the NIH's funding formula was apparently written by a drunk wizard in 1953.

[By the time a good idea gets funded](../references.qmd#nih-first-r01-age-45), the lead scientist is dead or the disease has evolved thumbs.

The NIH doesn't just fail to optimize for QALYs—it's accidentally optimized for the opposite. Every institutional feature creates perverse incentives:

* **Principal-Agent Problem:** Bureaucrats maximize job security and budget growth, not health outcomes
* **Wrong Payment Trigger:** The NIH pays researchers when grants are approved, not when patients are cured. This creates an industry of professional grant writers instead of disease curers.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Funders can't observe research quality, so they fund observable signals (credentials, publications, grant-writing ability) instead of results
* **Deadweight Loss:** [~50-67% of researcher time](../references.qmd#grant-writing-time-50pct) goes to overhead and grant writing—pure economic waste with zero QALY production
* **Innovation Externalities:** Researchers capture approximately 0% of the social value they create, so effort is catastrophically misallocated

**Economic Result:** The system produces QALYs at 10-100x higher cost than the theoretical optimum, while simultaneously maximizing DALYs through delay and bureaucratic friction. The core problem: paying for promises instead of paying for results.

Bureaucracy is a disease. The DIH is the cure.

## How to Build a Medical Research System That Actually Maximizes QALYs

You don't fix the NIH; you replace it. The Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) is what you build when you optimize for living instead of paperwork. It rests on four mechanism design principles that solve the core market failures in medical research.

### 1. Solve Information Asymmetry Through Revealed Preference

**The Market Failure:** Centralized funders face an impossible information problem—they must predict which of thousands of research proposals will produce the most QALYs, but they can't observe research quality ex ante, only credentials and grant-writing ability.

**The Economic Solution:** Route funding through patients who have skin in the game—their lives. This creates a revelation mechanism where preferences are aligned with expected QALY outcomes.

**The Mechanism:**
- Treasury gives subsidies directly to patients
- Patients choose which trials to join (revealed preference)
- Subsidies flow to trials that attract patients
- Trials that don't attract patients die

The NIH has 200 bureaucrats in a room eating stale donuts and trying to predict the future. The DIH has millions of patient-doctor pairs, each with distributed local information about what might work for their specific condition.

**Result:** You've replaced a grant-writing contest with a distributed information aggregation mechanism. This is the [Hayek knowledge problem](../references.qmd#hayek-use-of-knowledge) solved for medicine—no central planner can know what millions of patients and doctors know collectively.

### 2. Pay for Success, Not Grant Applications

**The Market Failure:** Researchers are paid for inputs (grant proposals, publications, credentials) rather than outputs (QALYs generated). The NIH literally pays people to ask for money instead of paying them to cure diseases. This creates massive misallocation—effort flows to gaming metrics instead of producing health.

**The Economic Solution:** Replace pay-for-paperwork with pay-for-success. Make researcher compensation a direct function of health outcomes. They get rich exactly when they maximize QALYs efficiently.

**The Mechanism:**
- **Per-patient funding:** Researchers earn (subsidy × patients enrolled). Patient enrollment is a market signal of expected efficacy.
- **Outcome bounties:** Massive prizes for solving clearly defined problems (e.g., "$1B to reverse aging by 10 years, measured by methylation clocks, provided it doesn't turn people into vampires")
- **Zero grant applications:** Eliminate the entire grant application process. 100% of researcher time goes to research, 0% to begging for permission.

**Result:** Perfect incentive alignment. In the NIH, you get rich by writing grant proposals. In the DIH, you get rich by curing diseases. Researchers maximize their income by maximizing QALYs per dollar spent. Self-interest becomes identical to social welfare—Adam Smith's invisible hand, but for not dying.


### 3. Prevent Regulatory Capture Through Algorithmic Governance

**The Market Failure:** Any institution controlling $47+ billion creates enormous incentives for rent-seeking and regulatory capture. The NIH's centralized decision-making creates exploitable single points of failure.

**The Economic Solution:** Remove the capturable agent. Make the system strategy-proof through algorithmic governance where corruption is mathematically impossible, not merely prohibited.

**The Mechanism:**
- **Smart contract governance:** All rules encoded in transparent, auditable code. Code can't take bribes or develop cocaine habits.
- **No CEO to corrupt:** Delete the position entirely. Nobody to lobby, nobody to wine-and-dine, nobody to offer a board seat.
- **Public ledger:** Every dollar tracked on a blockchain like a financial colonoscopy broadcast live to the world
- **Open source everything:** Any capture attempt is immediately visible to millions of observers

**Result:** The cost of corrupting the system exceeds any possible rent extraction. This isn't about trusting people to be good (they won't be). It's about designing a system where being bad is mathematically impossible. You replace bureaucrats with software, where the primary job of any remaining administrator is to code themselves out of existence—like hiring your own executioner.

### 4. Eliminate Knowledge Externalities Through Mandatory Open Science

**The Market Failure:** Medical knowledge is a public good (non-rival, non-excludable). Private markets systematically underproduce it. [Publication bias](../references.qmd#publication-bias-clinical-trials) means ~50% of trials never publish results, especially negative results. This creates massive duplication costs as researchers unknowingly repeat failed experiments.

**The Economic Solution:** Mandate complete data publication as a condition of DIH funding. Internalize the positive externality of knowledge sharing.

**The Mechanism:**
- Every trial, every result (positive AND negative), every dataset published in open-access format
- Researchers who hide data lose access to DIH funding permanently
- All data feeds into a unified global research commons
- AI agents continuously scan the data stream to identify patterns, connect researchers, and suggest promising combinations

**Result:**
- **Eliminates redundancy:** Researchers stop wasting decades rediscovering that mixing bleach and ammonia is bad
- **Knowledge compounds:** Each trial builds on the complete dataset, not a filtered subset biased toward positive results
- **AI acceleration:** Machine learning models train on comprehensive data, finding patterns humans miss
- **Estimated impact:** Publication bias and duplication waste [30-50% of research value](../references.qmd#research-waste-estimate). This mechanism recovers that loss—a 1.5-2x multiplier on QALY production at zero additional cost.

## The Core Innovation: Pay for Success

Every dollar in the DIH flows based on results, not promises:

- **Patients vote with their enrollment** → Researchers get paid for attracting patients (market signal of efficacy)
- **Communities vote with their pools** → Bounties get paid for solving problems (not for proposing solutions)
- **No one gets paid for:**
  - Writing grant proposals
  - Attending review committees
  - Publishing papers about why their research might work someday

This isn't radical. It's how every other industry works. You pay contractors when they build the house, not when they promise to build it. You pay farmers when they grow the food, not when they apply for a farming license.

The NIH pays for permission to do research. The DIH pays for research that works.

**Single-sentence summary:** The DIH is what you get when you pay scientists like you pay plumbers—for fixing the problem, not for explaining why it's hard.

## The Market Design: Three Interconnected Markets That Optimize for QALYs

The DIH doesn't create one market—it creates three nested markets, each solving a specific resource allocation problem:

### Market 1: The Trial Participation Market

**Allocation Problem:** Route patient subsidies to trials with highest expected QALY production

**Mechanism:** Patients choose which trials to join based on their assessment of risk/benefit. Subsidies flow to chosen trials.

**Why It Works:** Patient choice aggregates distributed information about treatment potential. Patients have the strongest possible incentive to evaluate correctly—their lives depend on it.

**Efficiency Gain:** Distributed information processing beats central planning (Hayek). The market automatically allocates capital to the most promising research.

### Market 2: The Researcher Talent Market

**Allocation Problem:** Allocate scientist time/effort to highest-value research directions

**Mechanism:** Researchers earn income from patient enrollment + outcome bounties. They shift effort toward research that attracts the most patients and solves the highest-value problems.

**Why It Works:** Incentive compatibility. Researchers maximize their income by maximizing QALYs—self-interest aligns with social welfare.

**Efficiency Gain:** Eliminates the misallocation where brilliant scientists spend careers studying obscure questions because that's what got them tenure.

### Market 3: The Public Goods Funding Market

**Allocation Problem:** Fund research with large positive externalities that individual patients won't finance (e.g., aging reversal, open databases, moonshot prizes)

**Mechanism:** Communities use [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) to pool funds and post bounties. Quadratic funding or conviction voting ensures preference revelation.

**Why It Works:** Solves the public goods problem without recreating bureaucracy. Communities self-organize around shared interests, fund infrastructure collectively.

**Efficiency Gain:** Gets the benefits of collective action without the costs of centralized administration.

---

**Combined Effect:** The three markets route capital to maximize QALYs across all research types—individual treatments, moonshots, and infrastructure. No central planner required.

## How You Fund It: The 3-Step Flow

1.  **You Fill the Treasury.** You use [The 1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) to redirect a rounding error from global military spending—`{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)`—into the DIH treasury.

2.  **You Let Humanity Set the Rules.** A global population of voters uses [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) to set the high-level budget. They don't pick specific trials. They vote on core allocation rules that govern the entire system, such as:
    *   **Patient Subsidies (~70%):** The bulk of the funds create a market for cures by subsidizing patient participation in [dFDA trials](../solution/dfda.qmd).
    *   **VICTORY Bond Returns (10%):** A fixed portion of all inflows is automatically routed to repay the investors who funded the treaty's passage. This is the financial engine that makes the revolution possible. See [The Investment Vehicle](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd).
    *   **Research Prizes & Bounties (~5-10%):** Funds moonshot projects and public goods that a pure patient-driven market might overlook.
    *   **Operations & Expansion (~5-10%):** Funds the core infrastructure and campaigns to grow the treaty from 1% to 5% and beyond.

This creates a transparent, dynamic, and capture-proof system for allocating humanity's health budget.

3.  **You Let Patients Fund Cures.** The treasury flows to patients as subsidies. This creates a vibrant, competitive marketplace where the best research attracts funding directly from the people who need it most.

### How You Fund the Big Stuff: Emergent Institutes

A marketplace of individual patients is powerful, but it won't fund the massive projects that benefit everyone. No single patient will use their subsidy to fund a **$1 billion prize to reverse aging** or a **shared data platform for all cancer researchers.**

These "public goods" are the difference between curing cancer and arguing about it on Twitter. This is where you introduce **emergent institutes.**

These aren't bureaucracies; they are tools for collective investment that arise from the community itself—like the Decentralized Cancer Institute ("For cells that forgot how to die") or the Decentralized Institute of Mental Health ("For brains that hate their owners"). When a community directs billions into trials, you give them tools to pool a tiny fraction of that flow. This allows them to collectively post massive prizes and fund shared infrastructure—the kinds of breakthrough projects a pure marketplace would ignore.

This is how you fund not just thousands of individual trials, but the entire ecosystem of innovation.

### How You Build the Machine: The Legal and Financial Engine

The DIH is a hybrid system designed to use the tools of capitalism to build a post-capitalist health economy. To do this legally and effectively requires a sophisticated legal architecture involving non-profits, lobbying arms, and a for-profit investment vehicle. For the full breakdown of this structure, see the chapter: [The Legal Architecture](../legal/legal-framework.qmd).

## The Result: A 10-100x Improvement in QALY Production Efficiency

The DIH isn't incrementally better than the NIH. Through pure mechanism design—no new technology, no better scientists—it achieves a **phase change in economic efficiency.**

### Projected Performance Metrics

| Metric | NIH (Current) | DIH (Projected) | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Payment trigger** | Grant approved | Results achieved | **Incentive revolution** |
| **Cost per QALY** | [$50,000-$150,000](../references.qmd#nih-cost-per-qaly) | $5,000-$15,000 | **10x reduction** |
| **Overhead percentage** | [50-67%](../references.qmd#grant-writing-time-50pct) | <10% | **6x reduction in waste** |
| **Time to treatment** | [10-17 years](../references.qmd#drug-development-timeline) | 2-4 years | **4x faster** |
| **Publication rate** | ~50% (positive results only) | 100% (all results) | **2x knowledge base** |
| **Trials run annually** | ~5,000 major trials | 50,000-500,000 trials | **10-100x scale** |
| **Researcher time on research** | 33-50% | >90% | **2x productivity** |

### How the Efficiency Gains Compound

These aren't independent improvements—they multiply:

1. **10x cost reduction** per QALY through elimination of overhead
2. **2x knowledge multiplier** from mandatory publication of all results
3. **4x speed multiplier** from cutting bureaucratic delays
4. **100x scale** from distributed trial infrastructure ([dFDA](../solution/dfda.qmd))

**Combined conservative estimate:** 10 × 2 × 4 × 10 = **800x improvement** in QALY production rate

**What This Means in Practice:**

The DIH + dFDA system, operating on the 1% Treaty budget of `{python} format_billions(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)` annually, could produce more QALYs than the entire current global medical research output. By 2040, this could mean:

- Cancer survival rates above 90% (currently ~68%)
- Aging treated as a reversible condition
- Rare diseases no longer "too expensive" to cure
- Personalized medicine available to everyone, not just billionaires

**The fundamental difference:** The NIH pays researchers to explain why curing cancer is hard. The DIH pays them to actually cure it.

This is what happens when you optimize for living instead of paperwork. When you pay for success instead of grant applications. When you replace committees with code and bureaucrats with math.

You replace a system that values credentials with one that values breathing. This is what happens when you stop paying people to ask permission and start paying them to deliver results.
