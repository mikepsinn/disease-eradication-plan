## A Love Letter to the National Institutes of Health (Just Kidding, They're Terrible)

Listen: The National Institutes of Health is where good ideas go to die of paperwork.

Every year, the NIH gets $47 billion to cure diseases. They spend most of it on:

- Committees to form committees
- Grants to study whether they should give grants
- Buildings in Bethesda that look important
- Researchers writing 100-page proposals that nobody reads
- Rejecting 90% of everything
- Making the other 10% wait 2 years to start

It's like hiring firefighters who spend all their time writing essays about water instead of putting out fires.



The **Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)** is what happens when you design a medical research system while sober and not actively trying to kill people with bureaucracy.

We take the $27 billion from the 1% Treaty and give it directly to people solving problems, instead of people asking permission to solve problems.

Revolutionary, I know.

## The NIH: A Case Study in How to Waste $47 Billion

### How the NIH Currently Works (A Tragedy in Five Acts)

**Act I: The Researcher Has an Idea**
Dr. Smith discovers something that might cure pancreatic cancer. She's excited. She's naive. She doesn't know what's coming.

**Act II: The Grant Application**
Dr. Smith spends 6 months writing a 100-page grant proposal. It includes:

- 47 citations proving she's not insane
- A budget accurate to the penny for work she hasn't done yet
- Promises about outcomes she can't possibly predict
- Her entire life story
- References from people who barely remember her
- A diversity statement
- An environmental impact report
- Probably her blood type

**Act III: The Waiting**
Dr. Smith waits 9 months for review. During this time:

- 1,000 people die of pancreatic cancer
- Her lab runs out of money
- Her best researcher takes a job at Facebook
- She develops a drinking problem

**Act IV: The Rejection**
Her grant is rejected. Success rate: 10%. Feedback: "Not innovative enough" (translation: we gave the money to someone who knows someone).

**Act V: The Loop**
Dr. Smith rewrites the grant. Resubmits. Repeats. By the time she gets funding, either:

- Someone else cured pancreatic cancer
- She's dead
- Pancreatic cancer evolved thumbs

This is how we spend $47 billion a year.



### The Numbers That Make Angels Weep

The NIH employs approximately 18,000 people. Of these:

- 6,000 are scientists (actually doing science)
- 12,000 are administrators (watching the scientists)

That's two bureaucrats for every researcher. It's like having two managers for every McDonald's fry cook, except the fries cure cancer and the managers prevent them from being made.

**Time researchers spend on actual research**: 40%
**Time researchers spend asking for money**: 40%
**Time researchers spend reporting on the money they asked for**: 20%
**Time researchers spend crying in the supply closet**: Uncounted but significant

## The DIH: What Happens When Adults Design Things

### The DIH Core Benefits: More Cures, Faster, Cheaper

**The headline: We deliver 80X more medical research per dollar spent.**

This isn't theoretical. The Oxford RECOVERY trial proved it: $500 per patient instead of $41,000, finding effective COVID treatments in weeks while the NIH was still filing paperwork.

**The Concrete Outcomes the DIH Delivers:**

1. **80X Cost Efficiency:** Pragmatic trials cost $500/patient vs $41,000 traditional. With the same $27 billion, we can test 54 million patient-treatments instead of 658,000. That's not an improvement; it's a different universe.

2. **10X Speed Improvement:** Treatments reach patients in 2-3 years instead of 17. For cancer patients who have 6 months to live, this is the difference between death and cure.

3. **1,000X More Treatments Tested:** By eliminating paperwork and bureaucracy, we can test every promising compound, not just the profitable ones. Those 166 billion untested compounds? We can actually try them.

4. **Optimal Resource Allocation:** Using econometric analysis and crowd wisdom to minimize DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) and maximize QALYs (quality-adjusted life years). Every dollar goes where it saves the most life-years.

5. **100% Data Transparency:** Every trial result published, positive or negative. No more wasting billions repeating failures because companies hid negative results. Knowledge compounds.

6. **Universal Patient Access:** 100% of patients can join trials (vs 15% currently). Subsidies mean poor people can participate. Rural people can participate. Everyone can contribute to and benefit from medical progress.

7. **Direct Economic Return:** Healthier population = $3.5 trillion annual productivity gain. Reduced healthcare costs = $2.8 trillion saved. The economic benefits alone justify the investment, even ignoring the human benefits.

**The Mechanism is Simple:** We pay patients to participate in trials, use software instead of bureaucrats, and publish everything. The outcome is revolutionary: actually curing diseases at scale.

The DIH doesn't create another NIH. It creates the opposite of the NIH.

Instead of one massive bureaucracy in Maryland deciding everything, we create disease-specific groups that actually give a damn:

### The Revolutionary Concept: People Who Have Diseases Should Decide How to Cure Them

Each disease gets its own treasury:

- **Decentralized Cancer Institute**: Run by people who have cancer
- **Decentralized Institute of Mental Health**: Run by people who are openly crazy
- **Decentralized Institute on Aging**: Run by people who are actively decomposing
- **Decentralized Institute of Rare Diseases**: Run by medical unicorns

Why does this work? Because someone with ALS cares more about curing ALS than a bureaucrat in Bethesda who can't spell ALS.

### The Complete List of Institutes (Or: Every Way Your Body Can Betray You)

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### The Full DIH Structure That Will Replace the NIH (And Actually Work)

**Major Killing Machines (The Big Institutes):**

- **Decentralized Cancer Institute (DCI)** - For cells that forgot how to die
- **Decentralized Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (DHLBI)** - For organs that pump, breathe, and leak
- **Decentralized Institute on Aging (DIA)** - For the crime of not dying young
- **Decentralized Institute of Mental Health (DIMH)** - For brains that hate their owners

**The Specialty Death Dealers:**

- **Decentralized Eye Institute (DEI)** - For eyeballs going dark
- **Decentralized Institute on Deafness (DIDCD)** - For ears that gave up
- **Decentralized Institute of Diabetes (DIDDKD)** - For bodies that can't handle sugar
- **Decentralized Institute of Arthritis (DIAMSD)** - For joints made of gravel

**The "Your Habits Will Kill You" Division:**

- **Decentralized Institute on Alcohol Abuse (DIAAA)** - For livers that look like raisins
- **Decentralized Institute on Drug Abuse (DIDA)** - For brains that need better hobbies

**The "Nobody Cares Until It's You" Department:**

- **Decentralized Institute of Rare Diseases** - For conditions affecting 12 people worldwide
- **Decentralized Institute on Minority Health (DIMHD)** - For diseases that discriminate

**The "We Should Have Fixed This By Now" Bureau:**

- **Decentralized Institute of Infectious Diseases (DIAID)** - For germs we can't kill
- **Decentralized Institute of Environmental Health (DIEHS)** - For poisons we keep making

Each institute is run by:

- 60% patients (people actively dying)
- 30% researchers (people trying to stop the dying)
- 10% administrators (absolute maximum, monitored by satellites)
- 0% politicians (critical for success)

## How Money Flows: From Treaties to Treatments

### Step 1: The Money Arrives (And Doesn't Get Stolen)

$27 billion lands in the DIH treasury every year. This becomes the world's largest clinical trial insurance fund.

**How Normal Insurance Works:**

- You pay premiums
- You get sick
- Insurance maybe covers treatment
- You still die because the treatment doesn't exist

**How DIH Trial Insurance Works:**

- The 1% Treaty funds the premiums
- You get sick
- DIH covers experimental treatments
- You pay a $20-50 copay
- You might actually live
- Your data helps the next patient

It's insurance, but for treatments that don't exist yet.

**How Normal Organizations Allocate Budgets:**

- Politicians horse-trade in back rooms
- Lobbyists bribe everyone
- The disease with the best PR wins
- Actual sick people are ignored

**How the DIH Allocates Budgets:**

- VICTORY bondholders vote using pairwise comparisons
- "Would you rather cure cancer or depression?" Click.
- "Would you rather cure ALS or diabetes?" Click.
- Aggregate millions of these choices
- Money flows to what people actually want cured

It's democracy, but for not dying.

### Step 2: Disease Groups Get Their Cut

Based on the vote, the money splits:

- $4 billion → Cancer (lots of voters have tumors)
- $3 billion → Mental Health (everyone's depressed)
- $3 billion → Aging (nobody wants to crumble)
- $2 billion → Heart Disease (ticking time bombs)
- $2 billion → Diabetes (sugar is delicious but deadly)
- And so on...

Each institute now has billions to spend. But here's the beautiful part: they can't spend it on bureaucracy.

### Step 3: The Money Has Rules (Enforced by Robots)

Smart contracts - which are neither smart nor contracts, but rather stupid computer programs that can't be bribed - enforce the rules:

**The Sacred 50/50 Split:**

**50% for VICTORY Bondholders and Referendum Rewards (~$13.5 billion/year)**

- ~$7.2 billion/year to bondholders (they took the risk, they get the reward)
- ~$6.3 billion/year to citizens who voted (democracy that actually pays)
- Creates unstoppable political momentum (everyone's getting rich)
- Turns greed into a force for good (beautiful)

**50% for Actually Curing Diseases (~$13.5 billion/year)**

This is where it gets interesting. The Disease DAOs vote on the split:

**Patient Subsidies (~$8 billion/year):**

- Money flows to the dFDA's operational wallet
- dFDA's algorithm calculates who gets how much
- Patients' digital wallets receive payment instantly
- No paperwork, no waiting, no bullshit
- Biggest line item because patients matter most

**dFDA Protocol Development (~$2 billion/year):**

- Building the trial platform that actually works
- Bounties for developers who improve it
- Prizes for efficiency breakthroughs
- Making sure the system gets better, not worse

**Research Prizes & Grand Challenges (~$2.5 billion/year):**

- The big "cure cancer" moonshots
- Medium "improve treatment" prizes  
- Small "fix this specific problem" bounties
- All paid on results, not promises

**Shared Infrastructure (~$1 billion/year):**

- The tech stack that makes everything work
- Free tools for every nonprofit
- Security that actually secures
- Backups of backups of backups

**0% for:**

- Conference rooms named after donors
- Retreats in Aspen
- Diversity consultants for the diversity consultants
- Reports about reports
- Committees to oversee committees
- Any building with columns

## The Clinical Trial Insurance Revolution: We Cover Your Experiments

Here's the most insane part of current medical research: sick people PAY to be guinea pigs.

You have cancer. A trial might cure you. To join, you need:

- $5,000 for travel to the trial site
- $10,000 in lost wages
- $3,000 for hotels
- $2,000 for someone to watch your kids
- Your house as collateral for the medical bills

It's like charging people admission to their own rescue.

### The DIH Solution: Clinical Trial Insurance Coverage

The DIH functions like an insurance company that covers experimental treatments. Here's how it actually works:

**What DIH Covers (100%):**

- All trial medications
- Required testing and monitoring
- Travel expenses (if you must travel)
- Lost wage compensation
- Childcare during treatment
- Any trial-related complications

**What Patients Pay:**

- Small copay: $20-50/month
- Time to report outcomes (5 minutes/week)
- Commitment to complete the trial

**How You Access It:**

1. Your doctor recommends a trial (like prescribing any treatment)
2. DIH pre-approves coverage (instant, algorithmic)
3. You get a DIH insurance card
4. Pharmacy fills trial meds like normal prescriptions
5. You pay your copay
6. Report outcomes via app

It's not "paying patients" - it's covering their costs so they can participate without going bankrupt.

**The Algorithm of Life (Literally):**

Patient subsidies are calculated by a transparent algorithm that a 5th grader could understand:

1. **How Much Will This Disease Kill You?**

   - Pancreatic cancer (kills everyone quickly) = $$$$$
   - Male pattern baldness (kills nobody ever) = $
   
2. **How Promising Is the Treatment?**

   - Novel mechanism never tried = $$$$$
   - Another me-too drug = $

3. **How Badly Does Pharma Ignore This?**

   - Rare disease affecting 12 people = $$$$$
   - Erectile dysfunction = $ (they've got this covered)

4. **Will Normal People Afford the Cure?**

   - Generic drug that costs $5 = $$$$$
   - Gene therapy that costs $2 million = $

**Real Examples:**

- Testing metformin for cancer: $5,000 per patient (cheap drug, huge potential)
- Testing gold-plated gene therapy: $100 per patient (only rich people will afford it anyway)
- Testing prayer: $0 (but we'll track the results for science)

The algorithm is public. The code is open source. Unlike the NIH's funding formula, which was apparently written by a drunk wizard in 1953 and never updated.

---

## The Transparent Research Marketplace: Finally, Scientists Can Find Each Other

Here's a fun fact: Right now, there are probably 17 teams working on the exact same cancer cure, and none of them know the others exist.

The NIH doesn't track this. Why would they? It's only a catastrophic waste of human life and money.

### The Problem: Everyone's Reinventing the Same Wheel (While People Die)

**Current System:**

- Dr. Smith in Boston is testing Drug X for Disease Y
- Dr. Jones in Seattle is testing Drug X for Disease Y  
- Dr. Lee in Houston is testing Drug X for Disease Y
- They'll discover each other in 5 years at a conference
- After they've each spent $10 million
- And recruited the same 1,000 patients
- Who could have been testing 3 different drugs
- But weren't
- Because nobody talks to anybody
- So people died
- The end

### The DIH Solution: A Search Engine for "Who's Working on Not Killing People"

We build ONE system where EVERYTHING is visible:

**The Universal Research Catalog** (Revolutionary Features):

- Every trial, everywhere, updated in real-time
- Every researcher, what they're doing, how it's going
- Every failure (because negative results save lives too)
- Every dataset (because hoarding data kills people)
- Everything searchable by anyone
- For free
- Forever

**The AI Matchmaker** (Like Tinder, But for Saving Lives):

- "Hey Dr. Smith, Dr. Jones is doing the exact same thing"
- "Maybe you should, I don't know, TALK TO EACH OTHER"
- "Or combine your studies and test twice as fast"
- "Or test different doses and share the data"
- "Just a thought from your friendly neighborhood AI"

**Automatic Collaboration Detection:**

- AI spots overlapping research BEFORE you waste money
- Suggests how teams could combine efforts
- Identifies gaps nobody's working on
- Finds patients for trials in seconds, not years
- Does all this while you sleep
- Never asks for a raise

Example: 

- 10 teams testing the same drug separately = 10 years, $100 million
- 10 teams coordinating through the marketplace = 2 years, $10 million
- Math even a congressman could understand

## How We Fund Research Without Grant Applications

The NIH grant application is 100 pages long. It takes 6 months to write. It has a 10% success rate.

The DIH application is 0 pages long. It takes 0 months to write. It has a 100% success rate.

How? We don't fund promises. We fund results.

### The Three Ways to Get DIH Money

#### 1. Solve a Problem, Win a Prize

We post bounties like the world's most helpful mob:

- "$50 million for reversing aging in mice by 2 years"
- "$10 million for cure that works on Tuesday"
- "$100 million for making cancer cells explode (safely)"

You solve it, you get paid. No applications. No committees. No bullshit.

**But Wait, Who Decides What Problems to Post?**

Not committees. AI and algorithms. Here's how:

**The AI Triage System** (Smarter Than Any Committee):

- AI analyzes every research proposal in 0.3 seconds
- Calculates potential lives saved per dollar
- Checks if someone's already solving this (they usually are)
- Estimates actual feasibility (not hopium)
- Assigns priority score
- Posts bounty amounts
- Does this for 10,000 proposals per day
- Never needs coffee

**The Decentralized Peer Review** (Like Regular Peer Review, But Honest):

Instead of the same 5 guys reviewing everything:

- Algorithm picks reviewers based on actual expertise
- Reviewers don't know whose work they're reviewing (no buddy system)
- Reviews happen in parallel, not sequential (weeks, not years)
- Reviewers get PAID (revolutionary concept)
- Bad reviewers get kicked out by algorithm (not protected by tenure)
- Everything published publicly (radical transparency)

Example Review Timeline:

- NIH: 9 months, 3 reviewers, 90% politics
- DIH: 3 weeks, 20 reviewers, 0% politics, 100% "will this work?"

**Why This Works:** Instead of paying people to TALK about solving problems, we pay them AFTER they solve them. It's capitalism, but pointed at human survival.

#### 2. Micro-Bounties for Micro-Progress

Not everything needs to cure cancer completely. We also pay for small wins:

- "$100K for software that matches patients to trials in 10 seconds"
- "$50K for algorithm that predicts drug interactions"
- "$25K for making trial consent forms readable by humans"
- "$10K for website that doesn't look like it's from 1997"

It's like Uber, but for incremental medical progress.

#### 3. Infrastructure Investments

Some things just need to exist, even if they're boring:

- Servers that don't crash
- Databases that actually connect
- Security that keeps China from stealing everything
- Coffee for the people maintaining all this

We fund these automatically, no applications required. If you're keeping the lights on, you get paid. Novel concept.

## Governance: Democracy Without the Stupidity

The NIH is run by whoever the President appoints, usually someone who donated enough money or married the right person.

The DIH is run by math.

### The Technology Stack: How We Built a Government That Can't Be Corrupted

The NIH runs on:

- Paper (mostly)
- Fax machines (yes, really)
- Email systems from 1995
- Excel spreadsheets that crash
- Dreams and good intentions

The DIH runs on technology that actually works:

**The Blockchain** (A Database That Can't Lie):

- Every transaction recorded forever
- Every vote tracked publicly
- Every dollar traceable
- Every decision transparent
- Politicians hate it (good sign)

**Zero-Knowledge Proofs** (Privacy Without Secrets):

- Analyze health data without seeing it
- Prove results without revealing patients
- It's like magic, but it's just math
- Protects privacy while advancing science
- Makes HIPAA look like a joke (which it is)

**The Universal API** (Everything Talks to Everything):

- Any app can connect
- Any device can contribute data
- Any researcher can access tools
- It's like the internet, but for not dying
- No proprietary bullshit

**AI Agents That Never Sleep:**

- **Research Matcher**: Finds duplicate studies in milliseconds
- **Patient Finder**: Matches patients to trials instantly
- **Fraud Detector**: Spots fake data before publication
- **Result Tracker**: Monitors real-world outcomes forever
- **Budget Guard**: Prevents administrators from existing

**Open Source Everything:**
Instead of every nonprofit building their own shitty systems:

- Free donor management (better than Salesforce)
- Free trial management (better than Oracle)
- Free accounting (better than QuickBooks)
- Free everything (better than bankruptcy)
- Saves millions that can go to actual research

Example: The American Cancer Society spends $50 million annually on IT. Under DIH, they spend $0 and get better tools. That's $50 million more for curing cancer.

### Smart Contracts: The Incorruptible Bureaucrats

Most DIH operations are run by smart contracts - computer programs that can't be bribed, don't take vacations, and never ask for promotions.

**What Humans Do:**

- Decide what to cure
- Set priorities
- Argue on Twitter

**What Robots Do:**

- Move money
- Enforce rules
- Track results
- Prevent theft
- Never sleep
- Never complain

**The Beautiful Features:**

- **Time Locks**: Big transfers wait 72 hours (in case someone's stealing)
- **Spending Limits**: Can't drain the treasury in one day (we learned from FTX)
- **Automatic Audits**: Every penny tracked forever (goodbye, Pentagon accounting)
- **Milestone Payments**: Money releases when you hit goals, not before
- **Public Everything**: All transactions visible (radical transparency, terrifying honesty)

It's like having the world's most honest accountant who works for free and can't be murdered.

## Why This Actually Works: The Psychology of Proper Incentives

### The NIH Incentive Structure (Designed by Satan):

**Researchers are rewarded for:**

- Writing grants (not doing research)
- Publishing papers (even if wrong)
- Getting tenure (then doing nothing)
- Building big labs (mini-empires)
- Never taking risks (safety first, progress never)

**Patients are rewarded for:**

- Nothing
- Actually, they pay to participate
- Then they die

**Administrators are rewarded for:**

- Creating more administration
- Hiring more administrators
- Making everything take longer
- Using all the budget (or losing it next year)
- Never being responsible for anything

### The DIH Incentive Structure (Designed by Humans):

**Researchers are rewarded for:**

- Solving problems (novel concept)
- Sharing data (radical transparency)
- Taking smart risks (innovation!)
- Collaborating (cooperation beats competition)
- Actually curing things (the point of all this)

**Patients are rewarded for:**

- Participating in trials (money!)
- Sharing their data (more money!)
- Not dying (priceless!)
- Rating treatments (like Consumer Reports but important)
- Helping others with their disease (community!)

**Administrators are rewarded for:**

- Not existing
- If they must exist, automating themselves out of jobs
- Making things faster
- Spending less
- Disappearing

## Case Studies: What $27 Billion Actually Buys

### Scenario 1: The Cancer Moon Shot (But Real This Time)

The Decentralized Cancer Institute gets $4 billion annually.

**How the NIH Would Spend It:**

- $2 billion on administration
- $1 billion on buildings
- $500 million on conferences in nice places
- $500 million on actual research
- Result: 3 new treatments in 10 years

**How the DCI Spends It:**

- $2 billion on patient subsidies (400,000 patients in trials)
- $1 billion on result prizes (50 major breakthroughs)
- $500 million on micro-bounties (5,000 small innovations)
- $500 million on infrastructure (that actually works)
- Result: 50+ new treatments in 2 years

### Scenario 2: The Rare Disease Revolution

5,000 rare diseases. Zero treatments. Why? No money in it.

**Current System:**
"Sorry, your disease only affects 100 people. Have you tried not having it?"

**DIH System:**

- Each rare disease gets a DAO
- Patients pool resources
- Global subsidy pool adds funds
- Researchers compete for bounties
- Result: Every disease gets attention

Example: Exploding Kidney Syndrome (37 patients worldwide)

- Patient DAO pools: $37,000
- DIH matching fund: $3.7 million
- Bounty posted: "Cure Exploding Kidneys, Win $3.7 Million"
- 17 research teams compete
- Someone wins in 18 months
- Kidneys stop exploding

### Scenario 3: The Aging Reversal Project

The Decentralized Institute on Aging gets $3 billion.

Instead of studying why old people fall down, they post a bounty:

**"$1 BILLION PRIZE: Reverse Human Aging by 10 Years"**

Requirements:

- Must work on actual humans (not just rich mice)
- Must be measurable (not just "feeling younger")
- Must be affordable (not just for billionaires)
- Must not turn people into vampires (important)

Result: Every anti-aging researcher on Earth suddenly very motivated.

## The Future: What Success Looks Like

### Year 1: The Chaos Phase

- NIH panics, claims DIH will kill everyone
- Pharmaceutical companies confused but intrigued
- Patients storm the digital gates to join trials
- First bounties posted, researchers scramble
- Congress holds hearings nobody watches

### Year 3: The "Holy Shit It's Working" Phase

- First major disease cured via bounty system
- Patient subsidies hit $10 billion annually
- 1 million people in decentralized trials
- NIH budget mysteriously increases "to compete"
- Several administrators apply to McDonald's

### Year 5: The New Normal

- DIH model copied by Europe, Asia
- Rare diseases start getting cured monthly
- Cancer death rate drops 30%
- Mental health crisis actually addressed
- Big Pharma pivots to bounty hunting

### Year 10: The Golden Age

- Most diseases have treatments
- Death becomes increasingly optional
- Healthcare costs plummet
- Humans live to 150, complain about it
- NIH converted to medical history museum

### Year 50: The Footnote
History books mention there used to be a thing called "grant applications." Children don't believe it. Teachers struggle to explain why humans used to pay bureaucrats to prevent medical research.

"They really made sick people pay to test medicines?" asks little Timmy.

"Yes," says the teacher.

"Why?" asks Timmy.

"Nobody knows," says the teacher.



---

## Why This Will Actually Happen

The NIH won't reform itself. Bureaucracies never do. They grow until they consume everything or get replaced by something that works.

The DIH isn't reform. It's replacement.

We're not trying to fix the grant system. We're making it obsolete.

We're not trying to improve committees. We're eliminating them.

We're not trying to streamline bureaucracy. We're automating it out of existence.

**The Beautiful Truth:** Once people see that paying patients works better than paying bureaucrats, there's no going back. It's like discovering fire after eating raw meat for centuries.

The NIH will fight this. They'll claim:

- "It's too risky!" (Says the system that takes 17 years to approve anything)
- "Patients can't make decisions!" (Says the system that excludes 85% of patients)
- "We need oversight!" (Says the system that lost $2.5 trillion)
- "Think of the safety!" (Says the system killing 120,000 people per decade)

But math doesn't care about their objections. Results don't care about their committees. And dying people definitely don't care about their paperwork.

---

## The Bottom Line: Bureaucracy Is a Disease, and We've Found the Cure

The NIH is a $47 billion machine for preventing medical progress while looking important.

The DIH is a $27 billion machine for curing diseases while eliminating middlemen.

One system pays researchers to write about maybe possibly potentially considering thinking about perhaps doing research someday if the committee approves.

The other system pays people who solve problems.

One system takes 17 years and $2.2 billion to develop one treatment.

The other system takes 2 years and $27 million.

One system is run by politicians and bureaucrats.

The other system is run by patients and code.

It's not even a competition. It's evolution. The dinosaurs don't know the meteor has already hit.

The beautiful part? We don't need permission to build this. We don't need Congress to approve. We don't need the NIH to agree.

We just need the 1% Treaty to pass, the money to flow, and the smart contracts to execute.
