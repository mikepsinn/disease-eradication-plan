## The Problem: 240x Unused Capacity

![](../../../figures/trial-access-disparity-chart.png){fig-alt="Column chart showing 5M enrolled, 1.2B willing, 2.4B with disease - massive unused capacity"}

Out of 2.4 billion people with chronic disease, [only 5 million participate in trials annually](../appendix/clinical-trial-participants.qmd). That's **0.2%**.

[Half of humanity would volunteer](../references.qmd#patient-willingness-clinical-trials) if they could. We have **240 times more willing participants** than we're using.

This isn't because people don't want to help find cures. It's because the current system can't scale. Trials cost [$41,000 per patient](../references.qmd#trial-cost-41k), require traveling to major medical centers, and have exclusion criteria that reject [85% of actual patients](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-exclusions).

**We're not facing a recruitment problem. We're facing a capacity problem.**

## The Solution: Just Let People Try Stuff (Carefully)

Here's a thought that apparently never occurred to anyone in Washington:

What if sick people could just... try treatments?

And then we could... write down what happens?

And then other sick people could... see what worked?

I know, I know. Without [17 years](../references.qmd#research-to-practice-gap-17-years) of paperwork, how would we know if medicines are safe? We'd have to rely on primitive methods like "observing if people get better or die." It's a bold strategy, considering our current one leaves [95% of rare diseases](../references.qmd#fda-untreated-diseases-95pct) with zero approved treatments and ensures [85% of patients are barred](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-exclusions) from the trials that might save them. We've managed to perfect a system where only the healthy and compliant are allowed to test cures for the sick and desperate. It's genius, in a suicidal sort of way.

This is because trials are designed to test drugs on people who don't actually exist. To get into a study for an antidepressant, for example, you can't have any other pesky problems like anxiety or PTSD. You can't have a history of drug or alcohol use. You can't be on other medications. You have to be the *perfect* kind of sick. The result? One investigation found that only [14.5%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14628985) of real-world patients with depression would actually qualify. The rest of us are too messy for their pristine, clean data.

On top of excluding everyone with a pulse, these "definitive" studies are run on comically small groups. They'll test a new heart drug on [275 people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50886/), a cancer drug on just [20 people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50886/), and a diabetes drug on [100 people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50886/), then prescribe the winner to millions.

![A chart showing a study for Wellbutrin where only 36 patients were in the final analysis, yet the drug is prescribed to millions.](../../../assets/wellbutrin-effectiveness-small-sample-size.png)

We're basing the survival of our species on a sample size smaller than a kindergarten class. So, instead of studying these mythical, perfectly sick unicorns, what if we just collected data from everyone who's *actually* sick?

### The Power of Real-World Evidence (Or: Spying on Sick People for a Good Cause)

The dFDA is built on a simple, powerful, and slightly creepy idea: we can learn more, faster, by analyzing data from real patients in the real world. This is called Real-World Evidence (RWE), which is a fancy term for "watching what happens."

Skeptics will say, "But that's just observational research! Correlation isn't causation!" They'll point to flip-flopping diet advice about eggs and cholesterol as proof that this is all voodoo.

![TIME magazine covers about eggs and cholesterol](../../../assets/eggs-time-covers.png)

They're not wrong about the old way. Old observational studies were flawed because they couldn't easily separate correlation from causation. Did the people who ate eggs also smoke three packs a day? The studies couldn't always tell.

![A comic illustrating that correlation does not equal causation.](../../../assets/correlation-does-not-equal-causation-comic.png)

But here's what's changed: we now have so much data and such powerful computers that we can overcome these problems. With modern data from wearables, apps, and electronic health records, a single person can become their own control group. We can track someone's arthritis pain for a month, have them take Turmeric for a month, then stop, then start again. By doing this, we can see if the Turmeric is actually doing something or if it's just a coincidence.

Modern statistical methods are so good that a [meta-analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200006223422506) found that the results from high-quality observational studies are generally the same as those from expensive, slow randomized controlled trials.

![A chart comparing effect sizes from observational studies and randomized trials for mortality.](../../../assets/observational-vs-randomized-effect-sizes.png)

![A chart comparing effect sizes from observational studies and randomized trials for various outcomes.](../../../assets/observational-vs-randomized-trial-effect-sizes.png)

We have the tools to get reliable answers from real-world data. We just have to actually use them.

### Introducing FDA.gov 2.0: Now With 80% Less Death

The dFDA upgrades FDA.gov from a digital cemetery to something useful. Cost: Less than one fighter jet that doesn't work.

Here's the revolutionary process:

### Step 1: Type in What's Killing You

<img src="../../assets/enter-condition.png" alt="Enter condition" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Revolutionary feature: A search box. The FDA's current website doesn't have this because they assume you've already died.

### Step 2: See What Actually Works (Based on Reality, Not Theory)

<img src="../../assets/clinipedia-inflammatory-pain-small.gif" alt="View ranked treatments" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Instead of "This drug is approved for exactly this condition in exactly these patients on exactly Tuesdays," you get:

"Here's what happened to 50,000 people who tried this:

- 40% got much better
- 30% got somewhat better
- 20% no change
- 10% grew a third nipple (but a useful one)"

It's like Consumer Reports, but for not dying.

**Treatment Rankings: Every Option, Ranked by Reality**

![Treatment Rankings Example](../../../assets/dfda-comparative-effectiveness-ranking-search.png)

Search any condition and see every treatment ranked by real-world effectiveness:

- **FDA Approved treatments** with effectiveness scores from actual patients
- **Phase 3 and Phase 2 trials** you can join right now
- **Experimental options** with preliminary data
- One-click access to join available trials

No more guessing which treatment your doctor half-remembers from a conference. Just clear rankings based on what actually worked for people like you. The current system never publishes negative results, so we waste billions repeating the same failed ideas. This ends that particular brand of expensive stupidity.

### Step 2.5: See the Future (With Financially-Backed Predictions)

To complement the real-world data from past patients, the dFDA will integrate a powerful forecasting tool: **live prediction markets**.

This isn't just polling experts; it's a marketplace where researchers, doctors, investors, and even the public can bet real money on a trial's future outcomes.

For any given trial, you'll see real-time odds on questions like:

- **Effectiveness**: "What are the chances this treatment will reduce tumor size by >50% in the next 6 months?" **Market Price: 38%**
- **Adverse Events**: "What is the probability of patients experiencing severe nausea?" **Market Price: 22%**
- **Completion**: "What are the odds this trial will be fully enrolled by its target date?" **Market Price: 71%**

**Why Trust This?**

1.  **Skin in the Game**: These aren't cheap-talk opinions. Bettors lose money if they're wrong, creating a powerful incentive for accuracy.
2.  **The Ultimate Fact-Checker**: [The DIH](../solution/dih.qmd) automatically resolves these bets using the actual, aggregated, and anonymized patient data collected by the dFDA. If the market predicts a 22% rate of nausea, and the real-world data shows 40%, the market learns and adjusts—or bettors go broke.

This gives patients an invaluable second layer of information: not just what *has happened*, but what the world's collective, financially-incentivized intelligence thinks *will happen*.

### Step 3: Join a Trial from Your Couch (While Dying Comfortably)

<img src="../../assets/autonomous-study-search.gif" alt="Join trials" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Current system: Drive 500 miles to a university hospital, wait 6 months, get rejected for having the wrong kind of dying.

New system: Click button. Get pills. Report if you die.

Revolutionary!

### Step 4: Get Drugs Delivered Like Pizza (But More Life-Saving)

<img src="../../assets/autonomous-cvs.gif" alt="Get treatment" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Amazon can deliver a banana costume in 2 hours but experimental medications take 6 months and require seven forms of ID?

The dFDA fixes that. Your pharmacy becomes a trial site. Your doctor becomes a researcher. Your dying becomes data.

### Step 5: Report Results Without a PhD in Paperwork

<img src="../../assets/reminder-inbox.gif" alt="Report outcomes" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Current system: 500-page case report forms that ask questions like "Rate your suffering on a scale of mauve to burnt sienna."

New system:

- "Are you dead?" Yes/No
- "If no, how dead do you feel?" Slider bar
- "Any new body parts?" Check all that apply

### Step 6: Everyone Benefits from Everyone's Suffering

<img src="../../assets/black-box-model-animation2.gif" alt="Improve rankings" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Your data helps the next person. Their data helps you. It's socialism, but for not dying.

Every pill becomes a tiny experiment. Every patient becomes a scientist. Every outcome gets recorded.

It's what we should have been doing since we invented writing.

## The Money Shot: How We Save 95% on Not Killing People

Look at these incredible savings! It's like Black Friday, but for survival!

| What We're Fixing | Current Insanity | New Reality | Money Saved | Lives Saved |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Clinical Phase Timeline | **[9.1 years (avg)](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-phase-duration)** | **2-3 years** | ~7 years of waiting eliminated | [~50,000/year](../references.qmd#beta-blocker-deaths) |

This eliminates $55 million of paperwork per trial. That's 55 million pieces of paper nobody reads, filed in cabinets nobody opens, in buildings nobody visits.

Those papers killed more people than they saved.

## Why This Works: The Mathematical Impossibility of Committees

Here's the problem with having [~200 FDA bureaucrats](../references.qmd#fda-reviewer-count) decide what 8 billion people can try when they're dying:

### The Math That Proves Centralization Can't Work

Let's calculate how long it would take the FDA to properly evaluate every treatment for every person:

```{python}
# Information processing capacity of the FDA committee
committee_members = 200
hours_per_day = 8
decisions_per_hour = 1
committee_capacity = committee_members * hours_per_day * decisions_per_hour
# = 1,600 decisions/day

# Information that actually needs processing
diseases = 10_000
treatments_per_disease = 100  # Potential treatments to evaluate
patients = 8_000_000_000
patient_variations = patients * 0.1  # Genetic variations matter
total_decisions_needed = diseases * treatments_per_disease * patient_variations
# = 800,000,000,000 decisions needed

# Time for committee to process everything
years_to_process = total_decisions_needed / (committee_capacity * 365)
print(f"Years for FDA to evaluate everything: {years_to_process:,.0f}")
# Output: 1,369,863 years

# Market processing (parallel, decentralized)
market_participants = 8_000_000_000
market_decisions_per_day = market_participants * 1  # One health decision per person
market_years = total_decisions_needed / (market_decisions_per_day * 365)
print(f"Years for decentralized system: {market_years:.2f}")
# Output: 0.27 years (100 days)
```

**The committee needs 1.3 million years. The decentralized system needs 100 days.**

### Why 200 People Can't Replace 8 Billion

The FDA doesn't know:

- What disease **you** have (they haven't met you)
- How **your** body responds to treatments (genetics are unique)
- What risks **you're** willing to take (some prefer death to side effects, others the reverse)
- Whether **you'd** rather die trying or die waiting (only you can answer this)

But they decide for you anyway.

### The Solution: Let 8 Billion Experts Make 8 Billion Decisions

**Current system:**

```
330 Million Americans
        ↓
   200 FDA Bureaucrats (Bottleneck)
        ↓
    17-Year Delays
        ↓
    Millions Die
```

**dFDA system:**

```
8 Billion Humans
    ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ (Parallel Processing)
Millions of Trials Simultaneously
        ↓
    Real-Time Results
        ↓
    Data Saves Everyone
```

This isn't ideology. It's information theory. You mathematically cannot centralize medical decisions for 8 billion unique people. The FDA could work 24/7 for a million years and still be behind.

The only solution is to let patients and doctors make their own decisions, then pool the data so everyone benefits from everyone's experience.

## Real Examples of This Working (While the FDA Wasn't Looking)

### The Oxford Recovery Trial: How the British Accidentally Saved Medicine

During COVID, while America was filling out forms, Oxford University did something crazy: they just tested drugs on dying people to see if they stopped dying.

Cost per patient:

- Normal clinical trials: [$41,000](../references.qmd#trial-cost-41k)
- Oxford pragmatic trials: [$500](../references.qmd#recovery-cost-500)

That's not a typo. Five hundred dollars. The cost of a nice dinner in Manhattan to save a human life.

Results:

- Found that [steroids cut COVID deaths by 30%](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-dexamethasone-results)
- [Saved over 1 million lives globally](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-summary-quote)
- [Took 3 months](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-100-days-to-cure) instead of 3 years
- Cost less than one Super Bowl commercial

The FDA's response: "But did they file the correct paperwork?"

### Wikipedia for Whether You'll Die

The system includes **Clinipedia**: Wikipedia but instead of arguing about whether tomatoes are fruits, we argue about whether they cure cancer.

Every treatment gets a page. Every outcome gets recorded. Every patient contributes data.

Imagine looking up your disease and seeing:

**"Exploding Kidney Syndrome"**

*From Clinipedia, the encyclopedia of not dying*

**Current Treatments Ranked by Not-Dying Score:**

1. Prayer (3% effective, 0% side effects)
2. Experimental Drug XJ-47 (67% effective, 30% chance of jazz hands)
3. Traditional medicine (5% effective, tastes like sadness)
4. Doing nothing (0% effective, 100% chance of exploded kidneys)
5. Essential oils (0% effective, room smells nice while you die)

*This page based on data from 10,847 patients who contributed their suffering to science*

### Become a Scientist from Your Couch

The system also lets you create your own studies. Got a theory that wearing socks inside-out cures baldness? Create a study. Get a link. Invite your balding friends to join. The system handles the rest. Your data gets published. Who knows, maybe you'll win a Nobel Prize. Or maybe you'll just prove that socks are socks. Either way, humanity learns something without spending two billion dollars.

## Your Personal Death-Prevention Assistant: The FDAi

Everyone gets a superintelligent doctor that lives in their phone and doesn't judge them for Googling "is my poop normal?"

The **FDAi** (Food and Drug Artificial intelligence) is like Siri, but instead of telling you the weather, it tells you how not to die.

**You**: "I have diabetes and my foot fell off."
**FDAi**: "Based on 50,000 similar cases, here's what worked:

- 60% success: Reattachment surgery + Drug A
- 30% success: Prosthetic foot + Drug B  
- 10% success: Hopping lessons + Prayer
- 0% success: Essential oils (but your remaining foot will smell lavender-fresh)"

It does this by connecting to all your data—from wearables, apps, and your medical records—and looking for patterns. It's automated root cause analysis for your own body, finding what's wrong while your doctor is still trying to remember your name. It's like having every doctor who ever lived in your pocket, except they actually agree on something.

## The Digital Twin Safe: Your Medical Data's Panic Room

<img src="../../assets/human-file-system.png" alt="Digital Twin Safe" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

Right now, your medical data is scattered across:

- 17 different doctors who don't talk
- 5 insurance companies that hate you
- 3 pharmacies that can't spell your name
- 1 veterinarian (long story)

The Digital Twin Safe puts it all in one place. It's like a Swiss bank account, but for your cholesterol levels.

You control who sees what:

- Insurance companies: "He's mostly alive"
- Doctors: Everything
- Researchers: Anonymized data
- Facebook: Absolutely nothing, Mark

---

## Outcome Labels: Nutrition Facts for Drugs

Food has nutrition labels. Cigarettes have warning labels. Drugs have... incomprehensible 40-page inserts written by lawyers having seizures.

**Outcome Labels** fix that - clear, data-driven summaries showing exactly what happens when real people try a treatment:

![Outcome Labels Example](../../../assets/dfda-outcome-labels.png)

Based on thousands of real patients with real outcomes:

**Cognitive Improvements:**

- Memory Recall: +35%
- Cognitive Function: +28%
- Executive Function: +22%
- Hippocampal Volume: +15%

**Side Effects:**

- Immune Response: +12%
- Headache: +9%
- Fatigue: +7%

No marketing spin. No 40-page legal disclaimers. Just clear data about what actually happens to people like you.

**Example: DEPRESSION CRUSHER 3000™**

*Outcome Label*

Based on 50,000 humans who tried this:

- 📈 Depression: ⬇️ 60% reduction
- 😴 Sleep: ⬆️ 30% improvement
- 🍆 Sex drive: ⬇️ 90% reduction (sorry)
- 🎺 Spontaneous jazz hands: 15% chance
- 💀 Death: 0.01% (better than depression!)

*This label based on actual humans, not laboratory rats who've never paid rent*

## The Disease Eradication Act: Making It Legal to Not Die

<img src="../../assets/right_to_trial_act_image.jpg" alt="Disease Eradication Act" style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%;" />

We need a law that says: "Dying people can try things that might help them not die."

The fact that we need a law for this tells you everything about our species.

**The Right to Trial Act** (working title: "The Stop Being Stupid About Medicine Act"):

**Section 1**: If you're dying, you can try experimental treatments.
**Section 2**: We'll write down what happens.
**Section 3**: Other dying people can read what we wrote.
**Section 4**: Repeat until nobody's dying.
**Section 5**: Seriously, how was this not already the law?

Congress will debate this for 17 years, the same time it takes to approve one drug.

---

## The Future: Where Death Becomes Embarrassing

### 2027: The Beginning of the End of Dying Slowly

FDA.gov becomes actually useful. Millions join trials from home. The first "Wikipedia disease" gets cured entirely through crowdsourced trials. The FDA claims credit.

### 2030: Big Pharma Pivots or Dies

Pharmaceutical companies realize they can't charge $10,000 for pills that cost $1 to make when everyone can see the data. Some adapt. Some become museums.

### 2035: The Great Revelation

We realize we could have done this all along. We had the internet since 1990. We had computers since 1950. We had writing since 3000 BC.

We spent 5,000 years letting people die while we filled out forms.

History books will call us "The Paperwork Age" and children will laugh at our stupidity.

### 2050: Death Becomes Opt-In

Diseases are mostly solved. Death becomes a choice, like smoking or voting Republican. The FDA's job becomes preventing people from becoming immortal too quickly (traffic is bad enough).

The last FDA form is filled out. It's immediately lost. Nobody notices.

### How the dFDA Actually Works

![Black box model animation showing how the dFDA works](../../../assets/black-box-model-animation.gif)

The dFDA achieves [**82x More Efficiency**](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-82x-cost-reduction) through:

- **Cost per patient**: $500 vs the current $41,000
- **Time to results**: 2 years vs the current 17 years
- **Patient access**: Universal access vs [85% excluded](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-patient-participation-rate) currently

{{< include ../../figures/fda-vs-dfda-efficiency-comparison-diagram.qmd >}}
