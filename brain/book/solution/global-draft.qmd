## How to Draft Everyone Into Not Dying

*Your Planet Needs You (Whether You Like It or Not)*

Here's how you implement mandatory service in humanity's first war worth fighting. Unlike previous drafts that sent teenagers to die in mud, this one conscripts everyone to stop dying from preventable stupidity.

The War on Disease isn't a volunteer position for people with too much free time and hemp bracelets. It's total mobilization against the thing that's actually killing you right now. You're already drafted by biology—cancer doesn't check if you signed up. The only question is whether you'll fight back or die confused.

## How to Structure Universal Service

*Two Ways to Serve: Fight or Fund (No Third Option)*

You create the simplest draft in history with only two service options:

### 1. Fight: Become a Referendum Warrior (Spread the Virus of Hope)

Share the referendum and get everyone on Earth to vote YES on the 1% Treaty. Your social network becomes the battlefield. Your shares are acts of war. Your ability to guilt-trip friends into voting is your superpower. You're basically a viral marketer, except instead of selling supplements, you're selling not dying.

- **What you do:** Share WarOnDisease.org with every human you've ever met
- **What you get:** First access to trials when dFDA launches (if you survive that long)
- **Why it matters:** Need 280 million votes to force politicians to act
- **Time commitment:** 5 minutes to vote, lifetime of annoying friends about it
- **Risk level:** Might lose some friends who prefer dying

**Your Current Mission (Since dFDA Doesn't Exist Yet):**

- Vote YES on the referendum yourself (takes 30 seconds)
- Share with 10 people today (copy-paste is your friend)
- Post on every social platform (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, OnlyFans, whatever)
- Text your family (guilt is a powerful motivator)
- Email your coworkers (they're dying too, remind them)
- Track your recruitment score (how many people you've converted)

### 2. Fund: Buy VICTORY Bonds (Profit from Not Dying)

Purchase bonds that fund the entire operation. Your money becomes ammunition in the war against your inevitable demise. You're a venture capitalist investing in humanity not going extinct.

- **What you do:** Invest $1,000+ in perpetual bonds
- **What you get:** `{python} format_percentage(VICTORY_BOND_ANNUAL_RETURN_PCT)` annual returns forever (or until heat death of universe)
- **Why it matters:** Money makes the trials go round
- **Risk level:** If this fails, money won't matter anyway because you'll be dead

## How to Handle Draft Dodgers

*The Philosophical Cowards of the 21st Century*

Those who refuse both options—who neither fight nor fund—are the draft dodgers of our time. They're the people who think dying of preventable disease is a "personal choice," like choosing between Coke and Pepsi, except one option is death.

These are the same people who would have sat out World War 2 because "fascism is just, like, your opinion, man." They want to benefit from everyone else's sacrifice while contributing nothing—basically freeloaders at humanity's potluck who brought nothing but complaints.

**The Social Consequences:**

- Public registry of non-participants (name and shame)
- Last priority for subsidized treatments (back of the line)
- Excluded from VICTORY bond profits (no free rides)
- Tagged as "Chose Death Over Mild Inconvenience" in all databases
- Their grandchildren will ask why they sat out humanity's finest hour

## How to Make the Referendum Their Draft Card

*Voting "Yes" = Reporting for Duty*

Here's how you turn a petition into a draft registration:

1. **Reframe the narrative:** The Global Referendum isn't asking for permission—it's conscription paperwork
2. **Make it binary:** Sign = You're in. Don't sign = You're a draft dodger.
3. **Add immediate benefits:** Signers get first access to subsidized trials
4. **Create urgency:** "Early enlistees get better terms" (FOMO for not dying)
5. **Track everything:** Blockchain verification of who's serving and who's shirking

**The Enrollment Process (Current Phase - Referendum):**

```
Step 1: Visit WarOnDisease.org
Step 2: Vote YES on the 1% Treaty
Step 3: Choose your service:
  - Fight: Share referendum, recruit voters
  - Fund: Reserve your VICTORY bonds (coming soon)
Step 4: Receive your referendum number
Step 5: Start spreading like a beneficial plague
```

**Your Fighter Missions (In Order of Importance):**

1. **The Personal Circle Assault:** Convert family and close friends first (they trust you for some reason)
2. **The Social Media Blitzkrieg:** Spam every platform with referendum links
3. **The Workplace Infiltration:** Slack, Teams, email—use company resources for good
4. **The Dating App Strategy:** Add "Vote on the 1% Treaty" to your bio (sexy and responsible)
5. **The Public Transport Campaign:** QR code stickers in bathrooms (captive audience)

## The Psychology of Mandatory Participation

*How to Make Conscription Feel Like Liberation*

Unlike military drafts that force you to potentially die, this draft forces you to potentially not die. It's the first draft in history where dodging it is literally choosing death over clicking a link.

**The Messaging for the Referendum Phase:**

- "Your grandparents were drafted to kill Nazis. You're drafted to share a link."
- "They stormed Normandy. You storm social media comment sections."
- "Greatest Generation: Defeated fascism. Your Generation: Defeats apathy about death."
- "Draft dodging in 1969: Principled stance. Draft dodging in 2026: Too lazy to click 'share.'"

**The Viral Talking Points (Copy-Paste These Everywhere):**

- "We spend $2.7 trillion on war, $68 billion on curing disease. Vote to fix this."
- "1% of military budgets = cures for 95% of diseases. Simple math."
- "Switzerland spends 0.7% on defense, has $93K GDP per capita. Coincidence?"
- "150,000 people died today while you scrolled Instagram. Vote to change that."

## The Mathematics of the Referendum

*Why 280 Million Votes Changes Everything*

The magic number is 3.5% of global population (280 million). History proves this is the tipping point where peaceful movements become unstoppable. Every major social change hit this threshold:

- Civil rights: 3.5% active support
- Women's suffrage: 3.5% active support  
- Indian independence: 3.5% active support
- Your health freedom: Currently at 0.00001% (that's you and like 12 other people)

**The Viral Math (How You Get to 280 Million):**

- You share with 10 people
- 3 of them vote (30% conversion rate)
- Each of those 3 shares with 10 people
- Process repeats until critical mass
- Day 1: 10 people
- Day 30: 1,000 people
- Day 60: 1 million people
- Day 90: 100 million people
- Day 120: 280 million (WE WIN)

**Current Score:**

- Votes needed: 280,000,000
- Votes collected: [REAL NUMBER HERE]
- Your personal recruitment score: 0 (fix this immediately)

## Your Draft Notice

*This Page Is Your Conscription Letter*

Congratulations, by reading this, you've been drafted. Your mission starts NOW:

**IMMEDIATE ORDERS (Do These in the Next 5 Minutes):**

1. Go to WarOnDisease.org
2. Vote YES on the 1% Treaty referendum
3. Share with 10 people (text, email, carrier pigeon, whatever)
4. Post on social media with #WarOnDisease
5. Set a daily reminder to share until we hit 280 million

**Your Fighter Metrics (Track These):**

- [ ] Personal vote cast
- [ ] 10 people messaged today
- [ ] Social media post shared
- [ ] Family group chat infiltrated
- [ ] Work Slack contaminated with hope
- [ ] Dating profile updated with referendum link
- [ ] Recruitment score: ___ converts

Failure to complete this mission will result in:

- Continuing to live in a world where we spend 40X more on killing than healing
- Watching everyone you love die of preventable diseases
- Missing the chance to be part of humanity's greatest pivot
- Having to explain to future generations why you couldn't be bothered to share a link

The referendum is your weapon. Sharing is your duty. Every vote moves us closer to a world where your parents don't die of cancer, your friends don't die of heart disease, and you don't die of whatever's scheduled to kill you.

Welcome to the War on Disease. Your keyboard is your rifle. Start firing.
