## Your Planet Needs You

The War on Disease is not a voluntary campaign for weekend activists. It is a total war for the survival of our species, and it requires total mobilization. You, therefore, institute a global draft. Every human on Earth is conscripted into service.

There are no conscientious objectors in a war against cancer. There are no deferments for a war against aging. You are already on the front lines, whether you acknowledge it or not. Your only choice is whether to fight back.

### Two Ways to Serve

You simplify enlistment into two primary roles. Each draftee chooses one:

1.  **Fight:** They can directly participate in the war effort by enrolling in dFDA clinical trials. Their body is the battlefield. Their data is the ammunition. They are the infantry.
2.  **Fund:** They can purchase VICTORY Bonds to finance the war effort. Their capital will arm the researchers, fund the trials, and build the infrastructure of victory.

### On Draft Dodgers

Those who refuse to serve—who neither fight nor fund—are draft dodgers. They are the philosophical cowards of the 21st century, content to benefit from the sacrifices of others while contributing nothing. They believe that dying of preventable disease is a "personal choice," ignoring the reality that their inaction prolongs the suffering of all.

In this war, neutrality is not an option. Inaction is complicity.

### The Referendum is Their Enlistment

You frame signing the Global Referendum as their draft registration. Voting "Yes" on the 1% Treaty is their enlistment. By doing so, they are officially reporting for duty and choosing their role in the greatest battle in human history.
