```{python}
#| echo: false
import sys
import os

# Quarto executes from project root (execute-dir: project in _book.yml)

project_root = os.getcwd()
if project_root not in sys.path:
    sys.path.insert(0, project_root)

```

Congratulations! You've passed the [1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) and now you've got $27.2B/year to allocate.

How do you avoid parasitic special interests from stealing it or bureacracy from wasting it all?

**Wishocracy** replaces committees with code and representatives with mathematics. It's how you let 8 billion people collectively decide how to spend $27 billion without it turning into a bureaucratic nightmare.

## The Magic: The Pairwise Smackdown

The core of Wishocracy is a voting method so simple, even a congressman could do it. It's called Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation, or simply, the **Pairwise Smackdown**.

Your brain can't rank a list of 20 priorities. It gives up around [item number seven](../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#cognitive-limit-seven-items). But it's fantastic at comparing two things.

Instead of asking, "Rank these 10,000 problems," the system asks:

**"What's more important right now: Curing cancer or fixing climate change?"**

You make a choice. That's it. You do this a few times with different random pairs. It takes five minutes. Millions of other people do the same. An algorithm then takes these millions of simple, head-to-head "smackdowns" and builds a perfect, real-time ranking of humanity's collective priorities.

It's the wisdom of crowds, but without the crowds having to talk to each other.

### Why This Actually Works (Math Warning)

When millions of people make pairwise choices:

- Random pairs prevent gaming
- [Statistical models (Bradley-Terry, PageRank)](../dih-economic-models/references.qmd#bradley-terry-pagerank-models) extract global preferences
- Outliers cancel out
- Wisdom of crowds emerges

Example with real numbers:

- 5 million people vote
- Each makes 20 comparisons
- 100 million data points
- Algorithm crunches numbers
- Output: "Humanity wants 28% on healthcare, 22% on education, 15% on climate..."

It's democracy without the stupidity. We still get the stupidity, but it's evenly distributed and thus cancels out.

## From Priorities to Projects

Once the Pairwise Smackdown tells you that "Curing Alzheimer's" is a top priority, Wishocracy translates that priority into action.

1.  **AI Breaks It Down:** An AI takes the impossible goal of "Cure Alzheimer's" and breaks it down into thousands of smaller, concrete, fundable tasks. "Cure Alzheimer's" becomes "Map protein structures," which becomes "Run AlphaFold on these sequences," which becomes "Rent computing time." Every impossible problem is just a series of possible steps.

2.  **The Bounty Board:** These tasks are posted to a global marketplace. It's like eBay, but for saving humanity.
    -   **WANTED:** A cure for Alzheimer's. **BOUNTY:** $10 billion.
    -   **WANTED:** A map of all protein misfolding patterns. **BOUNTY:** $500 million.

3.  **The World Competes:** The best teams from around the world, from MIT to some kid in a garage, bid on these tasks. Multiple approaches are funded in parallel. The ones that show promise get more funding. The ones that fail are defunded instantly. It's venture capital, but for not dying.

## The Opposition

**Politicians:** "But how do we get bribes if there's no one to bribe?"

**Answer:** Get a real job.

**Lobbyists:** "But how do we corrupt the system?"

**Answer:** You can't easily bribe a transparent, open-source algorithm being watched by millions. The cost of capture becomes prohibitively high.

**Bureaucrats:** "But who will form committees?"

**Answer:** Nobody. That's the point.

**Consultants:** "But who will make PowerPoints?"

**Answer:** AI makes better ones in seconds.

**Think Tanks:** "But who will write incomprehensible reports?"

**Answer:** AI will write clearer ones, instantly.

**Congress:** "But we're the representatives!"

**Answer:** You [represent donors, not people](../problem/unrepresentative-democracy.qmd).

**Skeptics:** "But people are too stupid to decide!"

**Answer:** People are individually stupid but collectively smart. Politicians are the reverse.

## The Truth: We Already Do This, Just Badly

Every time you:

- Like something on social media (micro-vote)
- Buy something on Amazon (economic vote)
- Choose a restaurant (quality vote)
- Swipe on dating apps (genetic vote)

You're participating in distributed decision systems. We're already a hive mind. We're just a badly organized one.

Wishocracy just makes it official, efficient, and pointed at problems that matter.

Instead of our collective intelligence being used to:

- Determine which cat videos go viral
- Optimize ad targeting
- Make billionaires richer
- Argue about pronouns

This system directs it to:

- Cure diseases
- End poverty
- Fix climate
- Explore space
- Make existence not suck

Same collective intelligence. Better targets.

## Democracy's Operating System Upgrade

Democracy 1.0 was designed for:

- 13 colonies
- 3 million people
- Horse-based communication
- Life expectancy of 40
- Three total issues (British bad, taxes bad, freedom good)

Democracy 2.0 (representative democracy) was designed for:

- Nation states
- Millions of people
- Telegraph communication
- Life expectancy of 60
- Dozens of issues

Wishocracy is Democracy 3.0, designed for:

- Global civilization
- 8 billion people
- Instant communication
- Life expectancy of ∞
- Infinite, interconnected issues

It's not replacing democracy. It's making it work.

Current democracy is like running Windows 95 on a quantum computer. Wishocracy is finally installing the right OS.

Will it be perfect? No.

Will it make mistakes? Yes.

Will it be better than letting cocaine-addled politicians decide based on bribes? Absolutely.

After all, we're all going to die anyway.

Might as well die in a system that actually tries to prevent it.
