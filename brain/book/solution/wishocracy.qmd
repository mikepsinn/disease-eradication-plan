## Wishocracy: What If We Let Everyone Decide, But Cleverly

[Wishocracy](./wishocracy.qmd) is democracy designed by someone who actually understands math and psychology.

Instead of asking 8 billion people to understand everything (impossible), we ask them to make tiny decisions they can actually handle.

It's like building a cathedral where each person only has to place one brick, but somehow the cathedral doesn't look like it was designed by a committee of drunk toddlers.

### The Six-Step Process (Or: How to Herd 8 Billion Cats)

**Step 1: Collect All the Problems**
"What sucks about existence?"

- Cancer (sucks a lot)
- Climate change (planet on fire)
- Poverty (most people have it)
- War (see previous chapters)
- Spotify ads (surprisingly high priority)

**Step 2: Make People Choose (But Gently)**
Don't ask "Rank these 10,000 problems."
Ask: "Cancer or climate change?" 
Just two things. Even Florida Man can handle two things.

**Step 3: Let AI Find Solutions**
Humans: "We want to cure cancer!"
AI: "Here are 50,000 possible approaches, ranked by probable success."
Humans: "...we'll take the top 10."

**Step 4: Break Everything Into Tiny Pieces**
"Cure cancer" becomes:

- Task 1: Sequence these genomes
- Task 2: Test this compound
- Task 3: Build this microscope
- Task 47,293: Make coffee for exhausted researchers

**Step 5: Match Tasks to People/Robots**

- Need genomes sequenced? → Beijing lab (cheapest, fastest)
- Need compound tested? → Swiss robots (never sleep, don't complain)
- Need coffee made? → Unpaid intern (tradition)

**Step 6: Track What Actually Worked**
Did cancer decrease? No? Stop funding that approach.
Did it work? Fund it harder.
It's science, but with receipts.

## The Magic: Aggregated Pairwise Preference Allocation (APPA)

APPA sounds complex because academics need tenure. It's actually simple:

### How Your Broken Brain Currently Tries to Prioritize

"Rank these 20 issues by importance:"

1. Healthcare
2. Education  
3. Climate
4. Defense
5. Infrastructure
6. Welfare
7. Research
8. Agriculture
9. [Brain melts]
10. [Random guessing]
11-20. [Fuck it]

Your brain gives up around [item 7](../references.qmd#cognitive-limit-seven-items). You're not stupid; you're human. This is like asking a goldfish to do your taxes.

### How APPA Makes It Simple

"Healthcare or Education?"

- Healthcare: 60 points
- Education: 40 points

"Climate or Defense?"

- Climate: 70 points
- Defense: 30 points

That's it. Two things. You can handle two things.

Do this 20 times with random pairs. Takes 5 minutes. A computer does magic (statistics). Suddenly we have a perfect ranking of all priorities based on millions of these tiny decisions.

It's like those Facebook quizzes that tell you which Harry Potter character you are, except instead of revealing you're Hufflepuff (disappointing), it reveals humanity's collective priorities (also disappointing, but useful).

### Why This Actually Works (Math Warning)

When millions of people make pairwise choices:

- Random pairs prevent gaming
- [Statistical models (Bradley-Terry, PageRank)](../references.qmd#bradley-terry-pagerank-models) extract global preferences
- Outliers cancel out
- [Wisdom of crowds](../references.qmd#wisdom-of-crowds) emerges

Example with real numbers:

- 5 million people vote
- Each makes 20 comparisons
- 100 million data points
- Algorithm crunches numbers
- Output: "Humanity wants 28% on healthcare, 22% on education, 15% on climate..."

It's democracy without the stupidity. We still get the stupidity, but it's evenly distributed and thus cancels out.

## The AI Parliament: Your Digital Representative Who Actually Represents You

Here's the beautiful part: You don't even have to vote.

You get a **Digital Twin** - an AI that knows what you want and votes for you. It's like having a representative who:

- Actually represents you
- Never takes bribes
- Never gets drunk at fundraisers  
- Never tweets stupid things at 3 AM
- Works 24/7 for free

### How Your Digital Twin Works

**Training Phase:**
"Do you prefer funding cancer research or heart disease?"
"Cancer."
"How about cancer vs. mental health?"
"Mental health."
[20 questions later]
"Got it. You care about mental health > cancer > heart disease > everything else."

**Autonomous Phase:**
Your twin votes on millions of micro-decisions while you sleep, eat, or watch Netflix. It knows your values better than your therapist.

**The Collective Result:**
8 billion digital twins negotiating constantly, finding optimal compromises, allocating resources based on what humans actually want rather than what politicians think we want.

It's like the world's most boring multiplayer game, but it ends poverty.

## The Problem Marketplace: Capitalism for Good

Once we know what problems to solve and have budgets, we need solutions. Enter the marketplace.

### Current System: Grant Hell

**How research funding works now:**

1. Researcher has idea
2. Writes 100-page grant proposal  
3. Waits 18 months
4. Gets rejected
5. Dies inside
6. Repeat

**Success rate:** [10%](../references.qmd#nih-sbir-grant-success-rate)
**Time wasted:** 90%
**Researchers who quit in frustration:** Most

### Wishocracy System: eBay for Solutions

**How it works with Wishocracy:**

Post: "WANTED: Cure for Alzheimer's"
Bounty: $10 billion
Deadline: ASAP

Responses flood in:

- MIT: "We can do it with gene therapy for $5 billion"
- Chinese lab: "We'll try 10,000 compounds for $2 billion"
- Some kid in garage: "I have an idea for $50,000"
- Elon Musk: "I'll fix it with rockets somehow"

Best proposals get funded. Multiple approaches run in parallel. Someone succeeds. Humanity wins.

It's venture capital but for not dying.

## Breaking Down Problems: The Task Tree of Life

Big problems are scary. "Cure cancer" sounds impossible.

But "cure cancer" is really just:

- Understand these 200 cancer types
- Which is really: sequence these genomes
- Which is really: run this machine 50,000 times
- Which is really: press this button repeatedly

Every impossible problem becomes possible when you break it down enough.

### The Alzheimer's Example

"Cure Alzheimer's" (impossible, scary, $10 billion)
├── Understand protein misfolding ($2 billion)
│   ├── Map all protein structures ($500 million)
│   │   ├── Run AlphaFold on these sequences ($10 million)
│   │   │   ├── Rent computing time ($1 million)
│   │   │   ├── Pay grad students ($9 million worth of ramen)
├── Test 10,000 drug candidates ($3 billion)
│   ├── Synthesize compounds ($500 million)
│   │   ├── Order chemicals ($50 million)
│   │   ├── Mix chemicals ($450 million)
│   ├── Test in mice ($1 billion)
│   │   ├── Buy mice ($10 million)
│   │   ├── Feed mice drugs ($990 million of tiny pills)

And so on until every task is so simple a robot or intern can do it.

The beauty: Multiple problems share tasks. Cancer research needs protein mapping. So does Alzheimer's. So does longevity. Fund once, solve multiple problems.

It's efficiency, but without the usual corporate evil.

## Real Example: How Wishocracy Would Handle COVID (If We'd Had It)

### What Actually Happened (A Clusterfuck):

**January 2020:** "It's just flu"
**February 2020:** "It's still just flu"
**March 2020:** "OH FUCK IT'S NOT FLU"
**April 2020:** "Try everything randomly!"
**2021:** "Vaccines work but half of people think they contain 5G"
**2022:** "Whatever, we're tired"
**2023-2025:** "COVID? What COVID?"

**Death toll:** [7+ million](../references.qmd#pandemics-vs-wars)
**Economic damage:** [$16 trillion](../references.qmd#covid-economic-damage-16t)
**Trust in institutions:** Deceased

### What Would Have Happened with Wishocracy:

**Week 1: Problem Identified**

- "New virus killing people"
- Priority votes flood in
- Budget: $500 billion (immediately)

**Week 2: Solutions Proposed**

- 10,000 research teams submit proposals
- AI ranks by probability of success
- Top 100 get immediate funding

**Week 3: Tasks Distributed**

- "Sequence viral genome" → Wuhan lab (they're closest)
- "Test existing drugs" → Every hospital globally
- "Design mRNA vaccine" → Moderna, BioNTech (parallel)
- "Manufacture masks" → Every textile factory
- "Create testing protocol" → South Korea (they're competent)

**Month 2: First Results**

- Genome sequenced, published
- [Dexamethasone identified as treatment](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-dexamethasone-results)
- Vaccine candidates in trials
- Mask production at 1 billion/day

**Month 6: Victory**

- Multiple vaccines approved
- Treatment protocols established
- Testing everywhere
- Death rate down 90%

**Total deaths:** Maybe 500,000 instead of 7 million
**Trust in institutions:** Slightly less dead

The difference? No committees. No politics. No bureaucracy. Just problems, solutions, and execution.

## The Opposition (And Why They're Terrified)

**Politicians:** "But how do we get bribes if there's no one to bribe?"
**Answer:** Get a real job.

**Lobbyists:** "But how do we corrupt the system?"
**Answer:** You can't bribe an algorithm.

**Bureaucrats:** "But who will form committees?"
**Answer:** Nobody. That's the point.

**Consultants:** "But who will make PowerPoints?"
**Answer:** AI makes better ones in seconds.

**Think Tanks:** "But who will write incomprehensible reports?"
**Answer:** AI will write clearer ones, instantly.

**Congress:** "But we're the representatives!"
**Answer:** You [represent donors, not people](../references.qmd#unrepresentative-democracy). You're fired.

**Skeptics:** "But people are too stupid to decide!"
**Answer:** People are individually stupid but collectively smart. Politicians are the reverse.

## Implementation Timeline: How to Boil Democracy Slowly

### Phase 1: The Trojan Horse (Year 1)
Launch as "supplementary advisory system"

- Politicians can "consider" the recommendations
- No threat to existing power
- Everyone thinks it's cute
- Meanwhile, it's learning

### Phase 2: The Proof (Year 2)
Small victories accumulate:

- City uses Wishocracy for parks budget, satisfaction up 400%
- Company uses it for R&D, innovation triples
- WHO uses it for disease priorities, actually prioritizes correctly
- Results impossible to ignore

### Phase 3: The Pressure (Year 3)
Public demands grow:

- "Why doesn't Congress use this?"
- "The AI represents me better than my representative"
- "Wishocracy says fund schools, why are we funding submarines?"
- Politicians sweat

### Phase 4: The Capitulation (Year 4)
First major government adopts it:

- Probably Estonia (they're weird like that)
- Or Singapore (they like efficiency)
- Works spectacularly
- Other countries panic

### Phase 5: The Cascade (Year 5)
Domino effect:

- EU adopts for budget allocation
- California tries it (of course)
- China builds their own version
- Even UK does it (after 5 committees approve)

### Phase 6: The New Normal (Year 10)

- Democracy 1.0 looks like bloodletting
- Politicians become ceremonial (like British royalty)
- Decisions based on data not donations
- Problems actually get solved
- History books mock the old system

## What the World Looks Like with Wishocracy

### Year 1: Chaos and Confusion

- Media: "THE ROBOTS ARE DECIDING EVERYTHING!"
- Reality: Humans are deciding, robots are just counting
- First budgets are weird (turns out humanity really hates mosquitoes)
- Traditional power structures panic

### Year 5: The Efficiency Revolution

- Government waste down 90%
- Decision speed up 100X
- Corruption becomes technically impossible
- Former lobbyists selling insurance
- Problems solved faster than created

### Year 10: The Golden Age Begins

- Poverty trending toward zero
- Diseases cured monthly
- Climate change reversing
- Education free and excellent
- Wars fought in video games only

### Year 50: Looking Back in Horror

- Museums dedicated to "The Time We Let Politicians Decide Things"
- Children learn about lobbyists like we learn about witch trials
- "Congress" becomes slang for "purposeless gathering"
- Democracy 1.0 viewed like we view leeches as medicine

### Year 100: Post-Scarcity

- All basic problems solved
- Humanity argues about which planets to colonize
- Death optional
- Work optional
- Wishocracy decides what to explore next
- Someone proposes bringing back politicians as a joke
- Proposal receives 0 votes

## The Beautiful Truth: We Already Do This, Just Badly

Every time you:

- Like something on social media (micro-vote)
- Buy something on Amazon (economic vote)
- Choose a restaurant (quality vote)
- Swipe on dating apps (genetic vote)

You're participating in distributed decision systems. We're already a hive mind. We're just a badly organized one.

Wishocracy just makes it official, efficient, and pointed at problems that matter.

Instead of our collective intelligence being used to:

- Determine which cat videos go viral
- Optimize ad targeting
- Make billionaires richer
- Argue about pronouns

We could use it to:

- Cure diseases
- End poverty
- Fix climate
- Explore space
- Make existence not suck

Same collective intelligence. Better targets.

## The Bottom Line: Democracy's Operating System Upgrade

Democracy 1.0 was designed for:

- 13 colonies
- 3 million people
- Horse-based communication
- Life expectancy of 40
- Three total issues (British bad, taxes bad, freedom good)

Democracy 2.0 (representative democracy) was designed for:

- Nation states
- Millions of people
- Telegraph communication
- Life expectancy of 60
- Dozens of issues

Wishocracy is Democracy 3.0, designed for:

- Global civilization
- 8 billion people
- Instant communication
- Life expectancy of ∞
- Infinite, interconnected issues

It's not replacing democracy. It's making it work.

Current democracy is like running Windows 95 on a quantum computer. Wishocracy is finally installing the right OS.

Will it be perfect? No.
Will it make mistakes? Yes.
Will it be better than letting cocaine-addled politicians decide based on bribes? Absolutely.

After all, we're all going to die anyway.

Might as well die in a system that actually tries to prevent it.

*P.S. - Your congressman doesn't know what an API is but votes on internet regulation. Your digital twin would at least Google it first.*

*P.P.S. - The Wishocracy protocol is open source. Unlike democracy 1.0, which apparently runs on corruption and prayer.*

*P.P.P.S. - If you think letting AI help make decisions is scary, remember: we currently let people who can't convert PDF to Word decide nuclear policy.*

#### Wishocracy: Preventing Capture

**Protecting the $24.3B From Special Interest Hamburglers**

**The Problem**: After we pay back the 10% to investors (the oligarchy that made this all possible), we still have $24.3 billion per year. Without safeguards, lobbyists and special interests will swarm like vultures. Within 5 years, the [DIH](./dih.qmd) would become just another captured institution funneling money to whoever has the best K Street connections.

**The Solution**: Wishocracy - where everyone votes on DIH budget allocation, preventing capture.

![Wishocracy Public Budget Voting Example](../../../assets/wishocracy-slider.png)

**How it protects the $24.3B from capture**:

1. **Anyone can propose projects**: Patient subsidies, trial infrastructure, expanding to a 2% treaty - all competing for funding
2. **Everyone votes through pairwise comparisons**: "Fund Alzheimer's trials" vs "Build trial infrastructure in Africa?" Simple choices, not 10,000-item ballots
3. **Mathematical aggregation prevents gaming**: Can't buy 51% of votes when there are 8 billion voters
4. **Real-time transparency**: Every allocation is public.

**Why this matters**: Investors who funded this deserve their 10% returns. But the remaining 90% must serve humanity, not special interests.

Without Wishocracy, the DIH becomes another captured institution and repeats the exact same failures all over again.
