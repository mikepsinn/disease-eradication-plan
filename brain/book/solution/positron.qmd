## The Engine of the DIH

The [DIH](dih.qmd) is the mission, [Wishocracy](wishocracy.qmd) is the operating system for setting priorities, and the **Positron framework** is the execution engine that gets the work done.

Think of it this way:
-   **The DIH** is the entity conducting the War on Disease.
-   **Wishocracy** is the tool humanity uses to tell the DIH what to do (e.g., "Cure cancer").
-   **Positron** is the army of AI agents that takes those orders and executes them.

The Positron framework is an open-source system for the autonomous production of public goods. Its core purpose is to **discover and execute positive-sum games**—actions that create more value than they consume. While we discuss it here as the engine for the DIH, it's designed for **any nonprofit organization** to run their own instance, dramatically increasing their operational efficiency and impact.

Here's how you build it.

### The Network Structure

The framework is a decentralized network of AI agents working in concert. At a high level, it looks like this:

```mermaid

    PN[Positron Global Network]
    NAA[Network Architect Agent]
    BA[Builder Agents]
    MN[Mission Network]
    CA[Coordinating Agent]
    PN1[Positron Node A]
    PN2[Positron Node B]
    TA1[Task Agent 1]
    PMA1[Performance Monitor]

    subgraph Global Level
        NAA -- Recommends --> BA
        BA -- Implements --> PN
    end

    subgraph Mission Level
        PN -- Contains --> MN
        MN -- Contains --> CA
    end
    
    subgraph Node Level
        CA -- Coordinates --> PN1
        CA -- Coordinates --> PN2
        PN1 -- Contains --> TA1
        PN1 -- Contains --> PMA1
    end

```

### Step 1: Create Positron Nodes

A "Positron Node" is just a fancy term for a container that holds your AI agents. Think of it as a digital barracks. Any nonprofit or group aligned with the mission can run one. Its job is to give your agents a place to live and the tools they need to work.

Inside each node, you have **Task Agents**. These aren't generalist AIs that write poetry; they are hyper-focused digital workers. Each one has a single, brutally specific job. They use a shared brain (retrieval augmented generation) for long-term memory, a scratchpad (context management) for short-term tasks, and a set of tools (APIs) to interact with the real world.

### Step 2: Define the Mission for Each Agent

Every agent gets a crystal-clear mission definition. No vague corporate nonsense. You do this by giving it:

1.  **A Wildly Important Goal (WIG):** One and only one. An agent designed to find potential cancer researchers does *only* that. It doesn't also try to organize their schedules. This prevents digital ADHD.
2.  **A Lead Measure:** The thing the agent *does*. For our researcher-finding agent, this is simple: "Number of qualified researchers contacted per day." It's a dumb, countable action.
3.  **A Lag Measure:** The *result* you want. For the same agent, this is the Key Performance Indicator (KPI): "Number of researchers who sign up for a dFDA trial." This tells you if the dumb action is actually working.

This structure, borrowed from "The 4 Disciplines of Execution," turns vague goals into a machine that you can measure and improve.

### Step 3: Let Them Compete

Anyone can design and launch a new agent to compete with existing ones. If someone thinks they have a better way to find cancer researchers, they can build an agent for it. You run them side-by-side and see which one delivers better results for less cost. The network evolves through ruthless, Darwinian competition.

### The Organizing Framework

The design of these agents isn't random. It's based on the six practices of high-impact nonprofits, as outlined in the book *Forces for Good*. This gives us a proven model for structuring our AI army.

This framework ensures our agents are designed not just for efficiency, but for high-impact, systemic change.

### How to Build It Without Skynet Taking Over (Human-AI Cooperation)

Current AI isn't smart enough to do this alone, which is probably for the best. The most effective approach is a model of **Human-AI Cooperation**.

The framework uses familiar developer workflows to manage the interaction between humans and AI:

*   **AI Proposes:** Agents create GitHub issues to recommend new strategies or improvements.
*   **Humans Review:** Human maintainers review, discuss, and approve these proposals.
*   **AI Implements:** Once approved, "Builder Agents" implement the changes, writing code and documentation and submitting them as pull requests.
*   **Humans Approve:** Humans perform the final review and merge the changes.

This model allows us to build the infrastructure for an autonomous future while pragmatically addressing the technology's current limitations, ensuring the humans are still in charge.
