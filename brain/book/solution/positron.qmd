## Your Army for the War on Disease

The [DIH](dih.qmd) is mission control, [Wishocracy](wishocracy.qmd) is the targeting system, and the **Positron Network** is your army of AI agents for fighting the War on Disease.

Think of it this way:
-   **The DIH** declares the war.
-   **Wishocracy** tells the army what hills to take (e.g., "Cure cancer").
-   **Positron** is the army of autonomous agents that actually takes those hills.

The Positron Network is an open-source system for building this army. Its core purpose is to **discover and execute positive-sum games**—actions that create more value than they consume. While we're showing you how to use it for the War on Disease, it's designed for **any nonprofit organization** to build their own AI army and maximize their impact.

Here's how you build your army.

### Why Your Army is Necessary (The Balance of Power)

Before we get to the "how," let's cover the "why." Superintelligence will amplify the primary objective of whoever wields it. Society has four major actors, each with a different goal:

1.  **Criminals:** Drain maximum resources from the productive economy. AI is a perfect tool for this.
2.  **Politicians:** Maximize power. Dark triad traits are highly predictive of political success, and AI will be the ultimate tool for Machiavellian power games.
3.  **Corporations:** Maximize profit. This is sometimes good, but often leads to lobbying for subsidies and regulations that stifle competition—a game AI will master.
4.  **Nonprofits:** Maximize global health and happiness.

Only one of these has an objective function aligned with humanity's best interests. Unfortunately, it's also the one that's the most outgunned and least efficient. The Positron Network is designed to fix this. It's about giving the good guys the same force-multiplying technology that the bad guys are already building.

### The Network Structure

The Positron Network is a decentralized system of AI agents working in concert. At a high level, it looks like this:

```mermaid
graph TD
    PN[Positron Global Network]
    NAA[Network Architect Agent]
    BA[Builder Agents]
    MN[Mission Network]
    CA[Coordinating Agent]
    PN1[Positron Node A]
    PN2[Positron Node B]
    TA1[Task Agent 1]
    PMA1[Performance Monitor]

    subgraph Global Level
        NAA -- Recommends --> BA
        BA -- Implements --> PN
    end

    subgraph Mission Level
        PN -- Contains --> MN
        MN -- Contains --> CA
    end
    
    subgraph Node Level
        CA -- Coordinates --> PN1
        CA -- Coordinates --> PN2
        PN1 -- Contains --> TA1
        PN1 -- Contains --> PMA1
    end

```

### Step 1: Deploy a Positron Node (Your AI Operating System)

A "Positron Node" is a configurable **AI operating system for your nonprofit**. Think of it less as a simple container and more as a digital headquarters where your AI army lives, trains, and works. Any nonprofit can deploy a node to automate its operations and radically increase its efficiency.

#### What Your AI Operating System Does For You

For a nonprofit, a Positron Node isn't just a technical tool; it's a force multiplier. It allows you to:

*   **Automate the Grunt Work:** Deploy agents to handle the soul-crushing tasks that burn out your staff, like grant research, donor outreach, and social media monitoring.
*   **Build Your Movement:** Use "Movement Building Agents" to find and engage supporters, turning casual followers into a dedicated base of evangelists.
*   **Master Advocacy:** Launch "Advocacy Agents" that can track legislation, coordinate public comment campaigns, and ensure your voice is heard by policymakers, all while you sleep.
*   **Optimize Everything:** Use "Agent Evaluators" to constantly measure what's working and what's not, allowing you to allocate your limited resources with ruthless, data-driven precision.

Inside this OS, you have **Task Agents**. These aren't generalist AIs that write poetry; they are hyper-focused digital workers. Each one has a single, brutally specific job. They use a shared brain (retrieval augmented generation) for long-term memory, a scratchpad (context management) for short-term tasks, and a set of tools (APIs) to interact with the real world.

### Step 2: Define the Mission for Each Agent

Every agent gets a crystal-clear mission definition. No vague corporate nonsense. You do this by giving it:

1.  **A Wildly Important Goal (WIG):** One and only one. An agent designed to find potential cancer researchers does *only* that. It doesn't also try to organize their schedules. This prevents digital ADHD.
2.  **A Lead Measure:** The thing the agent *does*. For our researcher-finding agent, this is simple: "Number of qualified researchers contacted per day." It's a dumb, countable action.
3.  **A Lag Measure:** The *result* you want. For the same agent, this is the Key Performance Indicator (KPI): "Number of researchers who sign up for a dFDA trial." This tells you if the dumb action is actually working.

This structure, borrowed from "The 4 Disciplines of Execution," turns vague goals into a machine that you can measure and improve.

### Step 3: Let Them Compete

Anyone can design and launch a new agent to compete with existing ones. If someone thinks they have a better way to find cancer researchers, they can build an agent for it. You run them side-by-side and see which one delivers better results for less cost. The network evolves through ruthless, Darwinian competition.

### The Organizing Framework

The design of these agents isn't random. It's based on the six practices of high-impact nonprofits, as outlined in the book *Forces for Good*. This gives us a proven model for structuring our AI army.

This organizing framework ensures our agents are designed not just for efficiency, but for high-impact, systemic change.

### How to Build It Without Skynet Taking Over (Human-AI Cooperation)

Current AI isn't smart enough to do this alone, which is probably for the best. The most effective approach is a model of **Human-AI Cooperation**.

The network uses familiar developer workflows to manage the interaction between humans and AI:

*   **AI Proposes:** Agents create GitHub issues to recommend new strategies or improvements.
*   **Humans Review:** Human maintainers review, discuss, and approve these proposals.
*   **AI Implements:** Once approved, "Builder Agents" implement the changes, writing code and documentation and submitting them as pull requests.
*   **Humans Approve:** Humans perform the final review and merge the changes.

This model allows us to build the infrastructure for an autonomous future while pragmatically addressing the technology's current limitations, ensuring the humans are still in charge.

### Data Sharing and Incentives (How to Not Build Silos)

A network is only as smart as the information that flows through it. To prevent nonprofits from hoarding their data, the network has two simple rules:

1.  **Share to Play:** To use the powerful, shared "Mission Network" agents that are funded by the collective, you have to agree to share your anonymized performance data back to the network.
2.  **Get Paid to Share:** For high-value data, the network can directly compensate nodes for their contributions, creating a market for insights that benefits everyone.

This ensures that every success and failure is a lesson for the entire network, making the whole army smarter over time.
