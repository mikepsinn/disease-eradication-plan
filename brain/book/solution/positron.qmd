## How to Build Your Coordination Army

You've got mission control ([DIH](dih.qmd)) and a targeting system ([Wishocracy](wishocracy.qmd)). Now you need an army of AI agents that actually executes the war on disease.

Here's the division of labor:
- **The DIH** declares the war
- **Wishocracy** tells your army what to fight for (e.g., "Cure cancer")
- **Your AI agents** coordinate the millions of people and resources needed to actually win

Here's how you build this coordination infrastructure. (We'll call it the "Positron Network" for reference, but what matters is understanding how to build it yourself.)

### Where Your Agents Get Their Missions

Your agents don't randomly decide what to work on. They pull from [Wishocracy's Task Tree](wishocracy.qmd#breaking-down-problems-the-task-tree-of-life)—the globally-prioritized breakdown of humanity's highest-priority problems into executable tasks.

Wishocracy creates the list. For example, "Cure Alzheimer's" becomes:
- Map protein structures → Run AlphaFold on these sequences → Rent computing time → Find cheapest cloud provider
- Test drug candidates → Recruit trial participants → Find people age 65+ with early symptoms → Contact researchers who study aging

Your agents work from this same list. Whether you're deploying agents from a nonprofit in Boston, a university in Beijing, or a biotech in Switzerland—all agents see the same prioritized tasks. This is how you coordinate millions of people without central control.

The secret (discovered by *Forces for Good*): Successful nonprofits don't work in isolation. They coordinate across sectors—with other nonprofits, businesses, governments, and the public. The way you do this at global scale is by having all agents work from one shared task list, regardless of who deployed them.

### Why You Need This (The Coordination Problem)

The NIH can't coordinate millions of researchers. The FDA can't coordinate global trials. Defense contractors coordinate trillions in spending, but health advocates can't coordinate billions.

The problem isn't lack of willing people—it's lack of coordination infrastructure. You can't manually coordinate:
- Millions of potential research participants across 195 countries
- Thousands of qualified researchers who need funding matches
- Hundreds of treaty advocates across different time zones
- Real-time trial data from decentralized sources worldwide

AI doesn't have this limitation. It can coordinate at scale, 24/7, across languages and time zones. The way you win the War on Disease is by building coordination infrastructure that your adversaries (NIH bureaucracy, FDA delays, defense lobbies) can't match.

    end

```

### Step 1: Deploy Your Coordination Hub

The way you join the network is by deploying a "node"—your organization's AI coordination hub. Think of it as your digital headquarters where AI agents work 24/7 to coordinate your piece of the War on Disease.

Here's what you use your node for:

**To Fund the War:**

You deploy agents that identify potential donors, foundations, and grant opportunities aligned with health causes. They draft grant applications, match funders with specific research needs, and coordinate fundraising campaigns. A human development director might research 20 foundation fits per week. Your agents research 200 per day and draft the applications.

**To Mobilize Support:**

You launch advocacy agents that track health legislation, coordinate treaty signature campaigns, organize awareness events, and recruit volunteers. Instead of one coordinator trying to schedule volunteers across time zones, your agents handle logistics while humans focus on relationships and strategy.

**To Accelerate Research:**

You automate the coordination work that slows medical progress—matching researchers with funding, recruiting trial participants, tracking outcomes, synthesizing literature, coordinating data sharing between labs. What used to take months of emails and phone calls happens continuously.

**To Build Awareness:**

You deploy content agents that create educational materials, track public sentiment on health issues, coordinate social media campaigns, and identify high-impact messaging. Instead of a marketing team manually A/B testing campaigns, your agents test hundreds of variations and optimize in real-time.

**To Optimize Impact:**

You use "Agent Evaluators" to measure which strategies actually save lives. Instead of guessing what works based on annual reports, you get real-time data showing which fundraising approaches work, which advocacy tactics change minds, which research collaborations accelerate progress. You double down on what works, kill what doesn't.

Inside your node, you build **Task Agents**—hyper-focused AI workers, each with one specific job in the War on Disease. They share a knowledge base for long-term memory, coordinate through a shared context system, and interact with research databases, government systems, and other nodes through APIs.

### Step 2: Define Each Agent's Mission (From the Task Tree)

Your agents pull their missions from Wishocracy's Task Tree. The way you prevent them from becoming useless generalists is by mapping each agent to one specific task from that tree. Here's how:

**1. Pick a Task from the Tree:**

Wishocracy's Task Tree breaks "Cure Alzheimer's" down into executable tasks like "Find researchers studying protein misfolding" or "Recruit trial participants age 65+ with early symptoms." You pick one task. Your agent does *only* that task. This prevents digital ADHD.

**2. Define the Lead Measure (the action):**

The thing the agent *does* to complete its task. For a "find researchers" agent: "Number of qualified researchers contacted per day." Simple, countable, and the agent controls it completely.

**3. Define the Lag Measure (the result):**

The outcome you actually care about. For the same agent: "Number of researchers who sign up for a dFDA trial." This tells you if the action is working.

This structure (borrowed from "The 4 Disciplines of Execution") turns tasks from Wishocracy's global list into specific agent missions you can build, measure, and improve.

The key: Every agent across the entire network works from the same Task Tree. Your cancer research agent in Boston might be working on "Find protein researchers" while someone's agent in Beijing works on "Find computing resources for AlphaFold." Both tasks come from the same Alzheimer's cure branch of the tree. This is how you coordinate globally without meetings.

### Step 3: Enable Competition Between Agents

Here's how you make the system evolve: You let anyone design and launch new agents to compete with existing ones.

If someone thinks they have a better way to find cancer researchers, they build an agent for it. You run both agents side-by-side and measure which one delivers better results for less cost. The winner gets more resources. The loser gets improved or retired.

The network evolves through ruthless, Darwinian competition. The best strategies win. The worst die. No committees. No politics. Just results.


### How This Enables Cross-Sector Coordination (The Forces for Good Secret)

*Forces for Good* studied the difference between successful and unsuccessful nonprofits. The key finding: Successful nonprofits coordinate across sectors—they work with other nonprofits, businesses, governments, and the public. Unsuccessful ones work in isolation.

The problem: Cross-sector coordination is nearly impossible to do manually. How do you coordinate a cancer nonprofit in Boston with a biotech in Switzerland, a university in Beijing, and individual researchers across 50 countries?

The solution: All agents work from the same global Task Tree. Your nonprofit's agent and the biotech's agent and the university's agent all see "Find researchers studying protein misfolding" as the next priority task. They automatically coordinate because they're working from the same list.

You base your agent design on the six practices from *Forces for Good*:

![The six-part organizing framework from the book Forces for Good.](../../assets/forces-for-good-organizing-framework.png)

This ensures your agents enable the proven success pattern—cross-sector coordination—rather than just automating isolated organizational tasks.

### How You Keep Control (Human-AI Cooperation)

Current AI can't run a global health movement alone. Good—you want humans making strategic decisions. Here's the cooperation model you use:

**AI Proposes:**

Your agents analyze what's working across the network and propose new strategies (via GitHub issues). Example: "Trial recruitment is 3x higher when we contact researchers on weekends."

**You Decide:**

Movement leaders review and approve strategic changes. Humans set direction. AI executes coordination.

**AI Implements:**

Once approved, "Builder Agents" update the coordination infrastructure—writing code, updating agent instructions, submitting improvements as pull requests.

**You Verify:**

You do final review to ensure changes align with the mission before they go live across the network.

This keeps you in strategic control while letting AI handle the coordination work humans can't scale. You're building infrastructure to coordinate millions of people fighting disease, not building Skynet.

### How You Prevent Data Silos

A coordination network is only as smart as the information flowing through it. Here's how you prevent organizations from hoarding data:

**Rule 1 - Share to Play:**

To use the powerful shared coordination agents (funded by the collective), you agree to share your anonymized performance data back to the network. No sharing, no access to the network effects.

**Rule 2 - Get Paid to Share:**

For high-value data, the network directly compensates your node. You create a market for insights that benefits everyone.

This ensures every success and failure becomes a lesson for the entire network. The whole army gets smarter over time, not just individual organizations.
