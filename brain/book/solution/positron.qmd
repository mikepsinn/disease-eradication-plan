## Your Army for the War on Disease

The [DIH](dih.qmd) is mission control, [Wishocracy](wishocracy.qmd) is the targeting system, and the **Positron Network** is your army of AI agents for fighting the War on Disease.

Think of it this way:
- **The DIH** declares the war.
- **Wishocracy** tells the army what hills to take (e.g., "Cure cancer").
- **Positron** is the army of autonomous agents that actually takes those hills.

The Positron Network is an open-source system for mass coordination. Its core purpose is to enable millions of individuals and organizations to coordinate their efforts in fighting disease—something that's impossible to do manually but trivial for AI. Instead of relying on slow, centralized bureaucracies, Positron creates a decentralized network where AI agents coordinate research, mobilize advocates, and accelerate trials 24/7.

Here's how you build the coordination infrastructure.

### Why Your Army is Necessary (The Balance of Power)

Before we get to the "how," let's cover the "why." Superintelligence will amplify the primary objective of whoever wields it. Society has four major actors, each with a different goal:

1.  **Criminals:** Drain maximum resources from the productive economy. AI is a perfect tool for this.
2.  **Politicians:** Maximize power. Dark triad traits are highly predictive of political success, and AI will be the ultimate tool for Machiavellian power games.
3.  **Corporations:** Maximize profit. This is sometimes good, but often leads to lobbying for subsidies and regulations that stifle competition—a game AI will master.
4.  **Nonprofits:** Maximize global health and happiness.

Only one of these has an objective function aligned with humanity's best interests. Unfortunately, it's also the one that's the most outgunned and least efficient. The Positron Network is designed to fix this. It's about giving the good guys the same force-multiplying technology that the bad guys are already building.

### The Network Structure

The Positron Network is a decentralized system of AI agents working in concert. At a high level, it looks like this:

```{mermaid}
graph TD
    PN[Positron Global Network]
    NAA[Network Architect Agent]
    BA[Builder Agents]
    MN[Mission Network]
    CA[Coordinating Agent]
    PN1[Positron Node A]
    PN2[Positron Node B]
    TA1[Task Agent 1]
    PMA1[Performance Monitor]

    subgraph Global Level
        NAA -- Recommends --> BA
        BA -- Implements --> PN
    end

    subgraph Mission Level
        PN -- Contains --> MN
        MN -- Contains --> CA
    end
    
    subgraph Node Level
        CA -- Coordinates --> PN1
        CA -- Coordinates --> PN2
        PN1 -- Contains --> TA1
        PN1 -- Contains --> PMA1
    end

```

### Step 1: Deploy a Positron Node (Your Coordination Hub)

A "Positron Node" is your **AI coordination hub for fighting disease**. Think of it as digital headquarters where your AI agents coordinate research efforts, mobilize advocates, and accelerate trials. Organizations join the network by deploying nodes that work together to execute the War on Disease strategy.

#### How Your Node Fights Disease

Your Positron Node solves the coordination problems that slow medical progress:

* **To Coordinate Research:** Deploy agents to identify qualified researchers, match them with funding opportunities, and coordinate trial participation. They work 24/7 to connect people who can cure disease with the resources to do it.
* **To Mobilize Advocates:** Launch advocacy agents that track health legislation, mobilize treaty supporters, and coordinate public campaigns. This gives your movement the reach of a global organization without centralized control.
* **To Accelerate Trials:** Automate the coordination of decentralized efficacy trials—recruiting participants, tracking outcomes, analyzing data. What used to take years of bureaucratic coordination now happens continuously.
* **To Optimize Impact:** Use "Agent Evaluators" to measure which strategies actually save lives. Double down on what works, kill what doesn't, based on real-time data instead of bureaucratic inertia.

Inside your node, you have **Task Agents**—hyper-focused digital workers, each with a single, specific job in the War on Disease. They use a shared knowledge base for long-term memory, context management for coordinating tasks, and APIs to interact with research databases, government systems, and other nodes.

### Step 2: Define the Mission for Each Agent

Every agent gets a crystal-clear mission definition. No vague corporate nonsense. You do this by giving it:

1.  **A Wildly Important Goal (WIG):** One and only one. An agent designed to find potential cancer researchers does *only* that. It doesn't also try to organize their schedules. This prevents digital ADHD.
2.  **A Lead Measure:** The thing the agent *does*. For our researcher-finding agent, this is simple: "Number of qualified researchers contacted per day." It's a dumb, countable action.
3.  **A Lag Measure:** The *result* you want. For the same agent, this is the Key Performance Indicator (KPI): "Number of researchers who sign up for a dFDA trial." This tells you if the dumb action is actually working.

This structure, borrowed from "The 4 Disciplines of Execution," turns vague goals into a machine that you can measure and improve.

### Step 3: Let Them Compete

Anyone can design and launch a new agent to compete with existing ones. If someone thinks they have a better way to find cancer researchers, they can build an agent for it. You run them side-by-side and see which one delivers better results for less cost. The network evolves through ruthless, Darwinian competition.


### The Organizing Framework

The design of these agents isn't random. It's based on the six practices of high-impact nonprofits, as outlined in the book *Forces for Good*. This gives us a proven model for structuring our AI army.

This ensures your AI army is pointed at the right enemy: systemic stupidity, not just inefficient spreadsheets.

### How to Build It Without Losing Control (Human-AI Cooperation)

Current AI isn't smart enough to coordinate a global health movement alone, which is actually good—you want humans making strategic decisions. The network uses **Human-AI Cooperation** to build coordination infrastructure:

* **AI Proposes Strategies:** Agents analyze what's working across the network and propose new coordination strategies (via GitHub issues). For example: "Trial recruitment is 3x higher when we contact researchers on weekends."
* **Humans Decide:** Movement leaders review, discuss, and approve strategic changes. Humans set the direction, AI executes the coordination.
* **AI Implements:** Once approved, "Builder Agents" update the coordination infrastructure—writing code, updating agent instructions, and submitting improvements as pull requests.
* **Humans Verify:** Final review ensures changes align with the mission before they go live across the network.

This keeps humans in strategic control while letting AI handle the massive coordination work that humans can't scale. You're building infrastructure to coordinate millions of people fighting disease, not building Skynet.


### Data Sharing and Incentives (How to Not Build Silos)

A network is only as smart as the information that flows through it. To prevent nonprofits from hoarding their data, the network has two simple rules:

1.  **Share to Play:** To use the powerful, shared "Mission Network" agents that are funded by the collective, you have to agree to share your anonymized performance data back to the network.
2.  **Get Paid to Share:** For high-value data, the network can directly compensate nodes for their contributions, creating a market for insights that benefits everyone.

This ensures that every success and failure is a lesson for the entire network, making the whole army smarter over time.
