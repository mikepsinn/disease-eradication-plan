## Why You Never, Ever Bring Your Own Contract to a Gun Fight

*(A Guide to Grant Agreements)*

So, a foundation wants to give you money, and your first instinct is to be helpful and draft the agreement for them. **Do not do this.** It's like showing up to a potluck at a Michelin-star restaurant with a bag of chips. You mean well, but you're embarrassing yourself and insulting the chef.

### The Golden Rule of Grant Agreements: They Write, You Sign

Here’s why the foundation **always** provides the contract:

1.  **Legal Counsel & Risk:** They have expensive lawyers whose entire job is to write iron-clad agreements that protect the foundation's money and tax-exempt status. Their legal team has vetted every clause. Your contract, written by a well-meaning revolutionary, is a legal liability to them.
2.  **Standardization:** A large foundation might issue hundreds of grants a year. They use a standard template for all of them to ensure consistency and manage their portfolio efficiently. They are not going to use a one-off agreement from a grantee.
3.  **Power Dynamics:** He who has the gold makes the rules. They are giving you money; you are accepting their terms. Providing your own contract is seen as naive at best and arrogant at worst. It signals that you don't understand how the grantmaking world works.

### So, What Do We Do? Be Prepared

Our job isn't to write the agreement, but to be ready to analyze the one they send us. To do that, we need to understand the key components of a typical grant agreement.

Think of this as an "annotated" sample agreement. This is our internal guide for what to expect and what to watch out for.

## Anatomy of a Standard Grant Agreement (For Our Eyes Only)

Here are the sections you will almost certainly find in the foundation's contract.

### 1. The Parties

*   **Who:** Identifies the "Grantor" (the foundation) and the "Grantee" (us, or more likely, our fiscal sponsor).
*   **What to check:** Are our legal names and addresses correct?

#### 2. Grant Amount & Purpose

*   **How much:** States the exact dollar amount of the grant (e.g., \$40,000).
*   **Why:** This is the most important section. It will explicitly state the **"charitable purpose"** of the grant. It will likely reference our proposal.
*   **What to check:** Does the purpose statement accurately reflect the project we proposed? Is it so restrictive that we can't actually do the work? For example, if it says "for the creation of 10 blog posts," we can't use the money for social media ads.

#### 3. Grant Term

*   **When:** The start and end dates for the grant period (e.g., "October 1, 2025, to September 30, 2026").
*   **What to check:** Can we realistically spend the money in this timeframe? If not, we might need to ask for an extension *before* signing.

#### 4. Payment Schedule

*   **How we get paid:** Outlines when and how the funds will be disbursed.
*   `Lump Sum:` All at once (best case).
*   `Milestone-Based:` Payments are released after we complete certain deliverables (more common for larger grants).
*   **What to check:** Are the payment terms clear? If it's milestone-based, are the milestones achievable?

#### 5. Reporting Requirements

*   **The price of the money:** This section details the reports we have to submit to prove we did what we said we would.
*   `Narrative Report:` A written summary of our progress.
*   `Financial Report:` A detailed accounting of how we spent every penny.
*   **What to check:** What are the due dates for these reports? What format do they need to be in? **Missing a report is the fastest way to get blacklisted.**

#### 6. Use of Funds & Restrictions

*   **The rules:** The legal "do's and don'ts." This section will explicitly state that the funds can **only** be used for 501(c)(3) charitable purposes.
*   **It will forbid:**
*   Lobbying or attempting to influence legislation.
*   Campaigning for political candidates.
*   Personal enrichment (no buying a new car).
*   Re-granting the money to another organization without permission.
*   **What to check:** Are there any unusual restrictions that would hinder our work?

#### 7. Record-Keeping

*   **The audit trail:** Requires us to keep detailed financial records for a certain number of years (usually 3-7).
*   **What to check:** Do we have a system in place to do this? (Our Airtable `Treasury` table is a good start).

#### 8. Publicity & Intellectual Property

*   **Bragging rights:** Outlines how we can (or cannot) talk about their grant publicly. Some foundations want to be acknowledged everywhere; others prefer to remain anonymous.
*   **Who owns what:** Clarifies who owns any "intellectual property" (e.g., software, reports, educational materials) created with the grant funds. Usually, the grantee retains ownership, but the grantor gets a license to use it.
*   **What to check:** Are we okay with their publicity requirements? Do we retain ownership of our work?

#### 9. Termination Clause

*   **The escape hatch:** Explains the conditions under which they can demand their money back. This usually involves misuse of funds or failure to complete the project.
*   **What to check:** What are the specific conditions for termination?

### Our Action Plan

1.  **Acknowledge the Offer:** Thank the foundation and ask them to send their standard grant agreement for our review.
2.  **Internal Review:** When we receive their agreement, we will compare it against the sections outlined above.
3.  **Legal Review (When Possible):** Once we have funding, we will have a nonprofit lawyer review all grant agreements. In the early days, we'll have to rely on our own diligence.
4.  **Sign and Return:** Once we're confident we can comply with all terms, we sign and return the agreement promptly.

By following this process, we demonstrate professionalism and ensure we are building a sustainable, compliant organization from day one.
