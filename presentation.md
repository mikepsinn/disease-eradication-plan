# The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ending War and Disease: A TED Talk

## SLIDE 1: Title Slide
**Visual**: Speaker standing next to a giant toilet made of money, flames coming out the top
**Text**: "How to Trick Humanity Into Not Killing Itself"
**Subtitle**: "A Love Story"

**SPEAKER**: 
"Hi. I'm here to talk about humanity's favorite hobby: spending $119 trillion a year to suffer and die. 

[pause for uncomfortable laughter]

Don't worry, this has a happy ending. Well, one of the endings does. The other one involves nuclear winter and eating bugs. "

## SLIDE 2: Meet Earth, Inc.
**Visual**: Organizational chart of "Earth, Inc." with drunk CEO, golfing board, and departments actively murdering each other
**Text**: "Current Management Structure"

**SPEAKER**: 
"Let's talk about Earth like it's a company. The security department spends a quarter of our budget shooting up the accounting department. The medical department watches everyone die while buying Band-Aids in bulk. The CEO is drunk. The board is playing golf. And somehow we're surprised the stock is tanking.

No other species does this. Dolphins don't have a military-industrial complex. Your dog doesn't invest in missiles. Just us. We're special."

## SLIDE 3: Humanity's Family Budget
**Visual**: Pie chart where military and disease spending dominate, medical research is literally invisible without magnifying glass
**Text**: "We spend 40X more on killing each other than curing each other"

**SPEAKER**: 
"Here's humanity's budget as a household making $100,000 a year:
- Healthcare: $8,200 - that's treating symptoms after we're sick
- Military: $2,700 - that's our 'home defense' 
- Medical research: $68 - that's finding actual cures

[click to zoom in with magnifying glass]

You literally need a magnifying glass to see the research budget. We spend more on Halloween costumes than curing cancer. One fighter jet costs more than all rare disease research combined.

This is like buying 1,600 mops instead of fixing the burst pipe."

## SLIDE 4: The $119 Trillion Death Toilet
**Visual**: Animated toilet with money flowing in - $9.7T (war) + $109.1T (disease burden) = $119T annually. Tiny $68B droplet labeled "research"
**Text**: "Annual Spending on Human Suffering"

**SPEAKER**: 
"Every year, we flush $119 trillion down the Death Toilet. 

$9.7 trillion on war - that's the direct cost of turning cities into parking lots and people into statistics.

$109.1 trillion on disease - that's the cost of letting everyone slowly fall apart while we watch.

And this tiny droplet here? [points] That's our research budget. It's like bringing a water pistol to a forest fire."

## SLIDE 5: The Pentagon's Magic Trick
**Visual**: Pentagon building with "$2.46 TRILLION" disappearing in a puff of smoke
**Text**: "Now you see it... now you don't!"

**SPEAKER**: 
"Fun fact: The Pentagon has LOST $2.46 trillion. Not spent. LOST. Like change in a couch, except the couch is the size of Nebraska and the change could cure cancer 250 times.

For context, that's enough money to give every human on Earth $300 just to stop asking questions."

---

## SLIDE 6: Your Democracy Score
**Visual**: Graph showing correlation between public opinion and policy outcomes - it's a flat line at 0%
**Text**: "Princeton University: 'Democracy is Already Dead'"

**SPEAKER**: 
"Here's a fun graph from Princeton. It shows how much your opinion matters in democracy. 

[pause]

It's zero. The line is flat. You have as much political power as your houseplant. Less, actually - at least politicians pretend to care about the environment."

---

## SLIDE 7: The FDA Death Counter
**Visual**: Graveyard with tombstones labeled "Died waiting 17 years" next to a single "APPROVED" stamp
**Text**: "95% of diseases have ZERO approved treatments"

**SPEAKER**: 
"The FDA takes 17 years to approve a drug. SEVENTEEN YEARS. That's longer than most dogs live. It costs $2.6 billion. And they ignore 95% of diseases because they're not profitable enough.

Know what takes less than 17 years? Dying from the disease you're trying to cure.

They kill 21,000 to 120,000 people per decade through delays. That's a mid-sized city worth of corpses because of paperwork. But hey, at least the forms were filled out correctly."

---

## SLIDE 8: NIH - Soviet Science in America  
**Visual**: NIH building as Soviet-style bureaucracy with "REJECTED" stamps raining down
**Text**: "90% rejection rate | 200 people pretending to know everything"

**SPEAKER**: 
"The NIH is literally Soviet central planning for science. 200 reviewers pretend to understand all of human biology. They reject 90% of grant applications. NINETY PERCENT.

Scientists spend 60% of their time writing grants, 40% doing science. It's like making Leonardo da Vinci fill out TPS reports.

We give them $48 billion a year to pick winners and losers. Spoiler alert: We're all losers."

---

## SLIDE 9: The War on Humanity vs The War on Disease
**Visual**: Two armies facing each other - one massive ($2.7T) labeled "War on Humanity", one tiny ($68B) labeled "War on Disease"
**Text**: "Guess which one we're losing?"

**SPEAKER**: 
"We're fighting two wars:
- The War on Humanity: $2.7 trillion a year, 75 years running, no victory possible
- The War on Disease: $68 billion a year, barely fighting

We fund death 40 times more than life. This explains everything wrong with our species."

---

## SLIDE 8: The Solution (That's Too Obvious)
**Visual**: Big red "X" over current spending, arrow pointing to flipped version
**Text**: "Step 1: Stop being idiots"

**SPEAKER**: 
"Here's an idea so obvious a child could think of it: Stop spending $2.7 trillion on murder and spend it on not dying instead.

[pause]

PROBLEM: This makes too much sense for Earth."

---

## SLIDE 9: The 1% Solution
**Visual**: Military budget as a pie, tiny 1% slice being removed
**Text**: "The smallest ask in human history"

**SPEAKER**: 
"So here's the compromise: Just 1%. One percent of the murder budget. A rounding error. Pentagon couch cushion money.

That's $27 billion a year. We'd still have $2.69 trillion for killing - enough to murder everyone on Earth 67 times instead of 68. 

I think we can live with that. Pun intended."

---

## SLIDE 10: What $27 Billion Buys
**Visual**: Animated counter showing what 1% could achieve
**Text**: 
- "54,000 clinical trials"
- "10-20 diseases cured annually"  
- "27 million patients treated"
- "Your grandma living to see 100"

**SPEAKER**: 
"With just 1% of the military budget, we could run 54,000 clinical trials. Cure 10-20 diseases every year. Treat 27 million patients. 

Or we could buy one aircraft carrier that will rust in a dock. Your choice."

---

## SLIDE 11: The Secret Weapon - Human Greed
**Visual**: Graph showing lobbying ROI - $1 in → $1,813 out
**Text**: "The best investment in the world (if you don't mind the screaming)"

**SPEAKER**: 
"The military-industrial complex spends $1 on lobbying and gets $1,813 back. It's a money printer powered by human suffering.

So we're going to do the exact same thing, but backwards. We're going to make curing cancer more profitable than causing it."

---

## SLIDE 12: VICTORY Bonds
**Visual**: WWII propaganda poster style - "BUY VICTORY BONDS - 40% RETURNS - DEFEAT DEATH"
**Text**: "Better than cocaine trafficking, legal-er too"

**SPEAKER**: 
"Introducing VICTORY bonds: 40% annual returns. That's better than:
- The stock market: 10%
- Real estate: 8%  
- Your cousin's crypto scheme: -100%
- Cocaine trafficking: 35%, but risky

It's capitalism, but pointed at not dying.

But wait - before we hand $27 billion to anyone, we need to talk about a problem..."

---

## SLIDE 13: The Capture Problem
**Visual**: NIH/FDA buildings with puppet strings attached to pharma/defense contractors
**Text**: "Why we can't just give $27B to existing systems"

**SPEAKER**: 
"You might think - great, we get $27B, give it to NIH and FDA, problem solved!

WRONG. They're already captured. NIH rejects 90% of grant applications. FDA takes 17 years to approve anything. They're run by ex-pharma executives who go back to pharma with 400% salary increases.

If we pour $27B into broken systems, we'll get $27B worth of broken results. We need systems that CAN'T be captured."

---

## SLIDE 14: How Wishocracy Works
**Visual**: Flow diagram - Anyone proposes → Random pairs shown → Swipe to allocate → Funds flow automatically
**Text**: "Democracy that actually works"

**SPEAKER**: 
"Current democracy: 535 people pretend to represent 335 million while actually representing whoever paid for their campaign.

Wishocracy: Instead of 200 bureaucrats deciding how to spend $27B, we let 8 billion people decide. You swipe left or right on funding proposals. Like Tinder, but for not dying. 

No committees to bribe. No gatekeepers to capture. Just millions of micro-decisions adding up to smart allocation. The $27B flows where humanity wants it, not where lobbyists want it."

---

## SLIDE 15: The Money Flow
**Visual**: Flow chart: Treaty → $27B Treasury → Wishocracy voting → DIH/dFDA → Actual cures → Bigger treaties
**Text**: "Money flows from voters to cures, no middlemen"

**SPEAKER**:
"Here's how the money flows:
1. Treaty creates $27B annual treasury
2. 8 billion people vote on what to fund through Wishocracy  
3. Money goes to Decentralized Institutes - mental health, cancer, aging
4. They fund trials through the dFDA marketplace
5. Cures happen, people live, everyone votes for bigger treaties
6. Repeat until death optional

No politicians. No committees. No corruption. Just math."

---

## SLIDE 16: dFDA vs FDA
**Visual**: Side-by-side comparison - FDA: 17 years, $2.6B, 95% diseases ignored vs dFDA: 2-3 years, $2M, 100% diseases covered
**Text**: "82X improvement (not a typo)"

**SPEAKER**: 
"The FDA is Soviet central planning. Takes 17 years, costs $2.6 billion, ignores 95% of diseases.

The dFDA is Amazon for clinical trials. Takes 2 years, costs $2 million, covers everything. 

Oxford already proved this works. They spent $500 per patient and saved a million lives. America spent $41,000 per patient and saved a million forms."

---

## SLIDE 17: The Two Timelines
**Visual**: Split screen - top timeline descending into darkness (Gollumland), bottom ascending into light (Wishonia)
**Text**: "Choose your own adventure"

**SPEAKER**: 
"We have two futures:

Path A - Gollumland: We keep funding the War on Humanity. By 2050, nuclear winter, eating bugs, fighting over bunker supplies. Life expectancy: 35. Mental illness: 80%. WiFi: Probably terrible.

Path B - Wishonia: We fund the War on Disease. By 2050, death is optional, suffering is extinct, everyone has their own AI doctor. Life expectancy: Whatever you want. Mental illness: What's that? WiFi: Telepathic.

We're literally choosing between Star Trek and Mad Max."

---

## SLIDE 18: Your Personal Death Clock
**Visual**: Interactive timer showing "150,671 people have died from preventable disease since this talk started"
**Text**: "This could be you"

**SPEAKER**: 
"While I've been talking, over 150,000 people died from preventable diseases. That's like a small city just... gone. 

Based on your age, you have a 23% chance of dying from something we could cure if we just moved some numbers in a spreadsheet.

But sure, let's build another aircraft carrier."

---

## SLIDE 19: The DIH Feedback Loop
**Visual**: Circular diagram showing: Peace dividend → Funds trials → Health outcomes → Bigger treaties → More peace dividend
**Text**: "Success creates more success (1% → 2% → 10% → Peace)"

**SPEAKER**: 
"Here's the beautiful part: Success compounds. Every disease we cure justifies bigger budgets. Treaty grows from 1% to 2% to 10%. Every life saved creates a voter for more funding. Every healthy person is a productive person who generates wealth.

It's a virtuous cycle, the opposite of the death spiral we're in now. Eventually, we're spending more on curing than killing. That's when we know we've won."

---

## SLIDE 20: Everyone Wins (Except Death)
**Visual**: Happy montage - defense contractors counting VICTORY bond returns, pharma companies high-fiving patients, politicians getting reelected, Death filing for unemployment
**Text**: "The ending where nobody dies"

**SPEAKER**: 
"In this new world:
- Defense contractors collect 40% returns forever from VICTORY bonds
- Politicians look like heroes and get reelected
- Pharma gets 80X more drugs to sell
- Insurance companies... actually, they can find real jobs
- You get to see your grandchildren graduate
- Death gets fired

Everyone wins. The military-industrial complex keeps 99% of their budget AND gets massive returns from the 1% that goes to health. It's not sacrifice - it's the best investment they'll ever make."

---

## SLIDE 21: The Call to Action
**Visual**: Big button labeled "STOP BEING IDIOTS" with website below
**Text**: "WarOnDisease.org - Vote on the Referendum. Buy VICTORY bonds. Live forever."

**SPEAKER**: 
"We're the only species that pays to kill itself. But we're also the species that invented cheese in a can, so clearly we're capable of miracles.

All we're asking is to move 1% of the murder budget to the not-dying budget. One percent. The military will still have enough to end the world 66 times.

Go to WarOnDisease.org. Vote on the Referendum. Buy VICTORY bonds if you like money. Tell your representatives you'd prefer to live.

Because here's the thing..."

---

## SLIDE 22: Final Slide
**Visual**: Earth from space, slowly transforming from gray/brown to green/blue
**Text**: "We can be the first species to defeat death... or the last species to cause it."

**SPEAKER**: 
"We put humans on the moon using computers weaker than your phone. We split the atom. We made the McRib. Surely we can figure out how to stop killing each other.

The people in charge aren't evil. They're just following incentives. So let's change the incentives. Let's make saving lives more profitable than ending them.

We can keep being the stupidest species in the universe, or we can try something else.

The choice is yours. Choose wisely. Your grandchildren are watching.

Well, they will be. If they exist.

Thank you."

[Speaker drops mic, toilet explodes with confetti shaped like pills and peace signs]

## Q&A Prep Notes:

**Q: "Isn't this just socialism?"**
A: "No, it's capitalism pointed at not dying. We're using the exact same system that built the military-industrial complex, just backwards. Free markets, but for cures instead of corpses."

**Q: "How do we know this will work?"**
A: "Oxford already did it. $500 per patient, saved a million lives. We're just doing that, but everywhere."

**Q: "What if countries cheat?"**
A: "Same thing that happens when they cheat on nuclear treaties - we publicly shame them and their citizens get mad. Plus blockchain receipts."

**Q: "This seems too simple."**
A: "The best ideas usually are. 'Wash your hands' seemed too simple. 'Don't dump sewage in drinking water' seemed too simple. 'Stop spending all our money on killing each other' is the same level of obvious."

**Q: "Are you calling us idiots?"**
A: "I'm calling us the species that spends 40 times more on killing than healing. You can pick your own adjective for that."
