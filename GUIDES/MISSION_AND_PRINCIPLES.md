This repository documents "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ending War and Disease," a book about getting every nation to sign the **1% Treaty** to redirect 1% of military spending to cure diseases instead of cause them. 

The plan involves creating a **Wishocratically governed** (using randomized pairwise preference allocations where everyone divides budget allocations between random pairs of priorities) global **Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)** that subsidizes patient participation in **80X more efficient decentralized pragmatic clinical trials**. 

All data flows through the **Decentralized FDA (dFDA)** which provides **Outcome Labels** for every food and drug, plus personalized treatment effectiveness rankings for all diseases.

## Core Principles

- **Primary Focus:** The unnecessary suffering and death from war (14M deaths/year) and disease (55M deaths/year). Every year we lose 69 million lives that could be saved.
- **The Problem:** Humans spend $119 trillion annually on war and disease while investing just 0.06% of that on finding cures. Children die of rare diseases while we build nuclear submarines.
- **The Solution:** Redirect just 1% of military spending to medical research through systems that are 80X more efficient than current approaches.
- **The Mission:** Save millions of lives by making curing people more profitable than killing them
- **Core Benefits to Emphasize:** The DIH delivers **80X more efficient medical research** (proven by Oxford RECOVERY trial: $500/patient vs $41,000), tests **1,000X more treatments** with the same budget, uses **economic analysis to minimize DALYs/maximize QALYs**, provides **complete data transparency** (no hidden failures), and enables **100% patient participation** (vs 15% in traditional trials). Focus on OUTCOMES (more cures, faster, cheaper), not mechanisms (patient control, DAOs).
- **Healthcare Integration Model:** The DIH functions as a **clinical trial insurance provider** that works WITHIN existing healthcare infrastructure. Patients pay small copays ($20-50), doctors recommend trials like any treatment, pharmacies dispense trial meds like regular prescriptions. We're NOT "paying patients directly" - we're covering their costs like insurance. This maintains medical ethics while removing financial barriers.
- **Anchor in Public Choice Theory:** All strategic arguments must be framed through the lens of public choice theory. Assume that all actors (politicians, corporate leaders, voters) act in their own rational self-interest. Avoid arguments based on abstract "national interests" and instead focus on the specific, concrete incentives that drive individual decision-makers.
- **Be Specific About the Goal:** Avoid generic phrases like "saving the world." Our objective is specific and measurable: to redirect 1% of global military spending toward curing disease. Frame the mission in these concrete terms, as the first step toward the complete eradication of war and disease. If you need shorthand for the goal say "End War and Disease" instead of "Save the World" or such nonsense
- **Identify the Incentive Gaps:** Frame the _problem_ not as a moral failure, but as a system with flawed incentives. The status quo is a rational response by individuals to a system that rewards rent-seeking and concentrates benefits for a few while diffusing costs to the many.
- **Engineer a Better Deal:** Frame the _solution_ as an exercise in incentive engineering. The goal is to create a new system with a superior set of **concentrated benefits** for a broader coalition of key actors. Always answer the question: "What's in it for them, personally and professionally?"
- **Co-Opt, Control:** Acknowledge that powerful interest groups exist. The strategy is not to destroy them but to make it more profitable for them to support our goals than to oppose them. This is "politics as exchange."
- **Use History Wisely:** Central planning has a documented history of causing unnecessary death (Soviet famines, Great Leap Forward, etc.). Use these examples as evidence that committee-based systems fail in complex domains - but present them as historical lessons, not ideological attacks. Walk readers logically from "committees failed at agriculture" to "committees are failing at medical research." Both Democrats and Republicans can agree that some problems need distributed solutions.
- **Be Concise and Direct:** Use short sentences, simple words, and powerful language.
- **Speak Plainly:** Avoid weak corporate euphemisms. Write like a human.
- **Quantify Everything:** All claims must be backed by data and citations.
- **Tell a Compelling Story:** This is not just a plan; it's a movement. Use the "chapters" to build a powerful narrative:
  - `problem.md` should graphically and emotionally depict the human cost of war and disease. It must build urgency.
  - `solution.md` should paint a vivid, hopeful picture of the future we are building—a world without war and disease. It must inspire.
