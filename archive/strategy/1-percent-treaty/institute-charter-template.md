## Institute Name

DIH–{Domain} (e.g., DIH–Aging)

## Mission

One paragraph on purpose, focusing on accelerating evidence generation, patient access, and alignment to the 1% Treaty referendum.

## Scope

- Diseases/conditions covered
- Key programs (registries, trials-on-dFDA, advocacy, standards contributions)

## Roles & Titles

- Institute Chair (term: 1 year, renewable once)
- Fellows / Founding Fellows
- Ambassadors (regional/domain)
- Affiliate Partners (org-level MOUs)
- Ad hoc Expert Reviewers (credentialed by attestations; auto-selected per proposal)

All appointments are criteria-based, conflict-of-interest disclosed, and listed in a public directory.

## Governance & Operations

- Continuous OKRs auto-computed from data and on-chain events; public dashboards
- No standing meetings; asynchronous review windows with timeboxed decisions
- Execution by smart contracts; emergency-only human custodianship (credentialed multisig with sunset)
- Code of Conduct and COI policy adherence (attested and machine-checked)

## Interfaces

- Coordination with DIH Treasury, Safety, Data/Interop, and AI/Methods
- dFDA Infrastructure usage: trial templates, data standards, and outcome reporting
- On-chain modules used: grants/QF rounds, outcome bounties, patient subsidies
- Oracles consumed: evidence, identity/COI, safety; institute maintains a public attestation feed

## Success Metrics

- Referendum signatures mobilized, orgs endorsed, trials launched, participants subsidized, evidence produced, savings redeemed, incident rate/time-to-mitigation, and adoptions of standards.

## Branding & Title Use

- Titles are honorary/programmatic (no regulatory authority). Use DIH brand per brand guide; revocable for violations.

## Safety & Risk Controls

- Circuit-breaker for payouts upon severity-scored incidents; remediation plan and staged unpause
- Clawback rules for falsification or misconduct; immutable audit logs and public reports
