# Operation Wartime General: A Strategy for Recruiting the Supreme Allied Commander, War on Disease

## Executive Summary

We are not filling a job vacancy. We are recruiting the founding **Supreme Allied Commander, War on Disease**. With an initial grant of $60,000 from lifespan.io, our objective is to find and empower a unique leader—a brilliant AI-executor—to build and command an army of AI agents to win the war against human suffering.

This person's first battle is clear: **achieve a 3.5% survey submission rate across all nations** using `@/proposals/survey.md` as the primary recruitment tool, and **generate a self-sustaining income stream** to fund the ongoing offensive.

This is not a role for a mere strategist; it is a role for a master builder who will personally architect and deploy the automated systems necessary for victory.

## Part 1: The Commander Profile

We are searching for a rare combination of world-class engineering talent, strategic vision, and relentless drive.

**Key Attributes:**

1.  **The Full-Stack AI-Executor:** This is a non-negotiable, hands-on-keyboard role. The candidate must be a brilliant architect and implementer, with demonstrated mastery in two key areas:

    - **Autonomous Systems:** Creating complex, autonomous AI agent workflows.
    - **Full-Stack Development:** Building robust applications (React, API design, data engineering, and blockchain).
2.  **The Automation Architect:** They must think in terms of systems and scale. Their primary instinct should be to automate everything: outreach, fundraising, data analysis, and operational logistics.
3.  **The Growth Tactician:** They must have a deep understanding of what drives viral growth and how to build feedback loops. Their first product is an automated machine for recruiting humanity to the cause.
4.  **Deeply Mission-Aligned:** The ideal candidate will see the "War on Disease" as their life's work. They must have the resilience to pursue a monumental goal and the moral clarity to command a mission of this magnitude.

## Part 2: The Recruitment & Selection Strategy

This role requires a targeted, outbound search for proven executors.

**Step 1: The Prospect List (Where to Hunt)**

- **AI Agent & Automation Builders:** Identify the top contributors and creators of leading open-source AI agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, AutoGPT) and workflow automation tools (e.g., n8n).
- **Growth Engineers from Hyper-Scale Startups:** Find the early engineers who built the referral and growth systems at companies known for viral scaling.
- **Founders of AI-Native Startups:** Look for founders (especially technical founders) from the YC/top-tier accelerator ecosystem who have built companies around AI and automation.

**Step 2: The Outreach (The Call to Arms)**

- **Subject:** A command in the War on Disease
- **Body:** "Hi [Name], I'm reaching out because I was impressed by your work on [Specific AI Project/Framework]. The architecture of [Specific System] demonstrates a mastery of building scalable, autonomous systems. We are recruiting the founding Supreme Allied Commander for the War on Disease, a mission to automate the fight against human suffering. The first objective is to build an AI-driven engine to mobilize 3.5% of humanity. Given your background, I believe you may have the unique skills required to lead this offensive. Would you be open to a confidential briefing?"

**Step 3: The "Interview" - A Mutual Due Diligence Process**

1.  **The Mission Deep Dive (Call 1):** A conversation about the vision and the mandate.
2.  **The Strategic Plan Review (Call 2):** The candidate presents their initial 90-day plan of attack for building the AI army to achieve the 3.5% goal and financial sustainability.
3.  **The Architectural Session (Final Stage):** A 2-hour, deep-dive technical session where you and the candidate co-design the high-level architecture of the AI agent system. This tests their technical depth, strategic thinking, and collaborative ability under pressure.

## Part 3: The Offer & The Mandate (The First Battle Plan)

**The Offer:**

- **Title:** Supreme Allied Commander, War on Disease (initial title: Founding AI Architect & Mission Lead).
- **Compensation:** A $60,000 "War Chest" Grant to provide runway for the initial 4-6 month offensive.
- **Incentive:** A commanding equity stake in the legal entity to be formed.

**The Mandate: The 3.5% Offensive**
Upon accepting, the Commander's sole focus is to build the systems required to achieve the following success conditions, unlocking the next phase of funding and hiring.

- **Primary Objective: Build the "AI Recruitment Engine"**
- **Mission:** Architect and deploy an army of AI agents to automate the process of driving submissions to the global survey and converting supporters into donors.
- **Key Actions:** 1. Develop automated systems for identifying and reaching potential supporters across various platforms. 2. Create AI-driven communication workflows to engage individuals and communities, maximizing viral sharing of the survey. 3. Build and optimize automated funnels to convert survey participants into recurring donors, creating a sustainable income stream.
- **Success Metrics (to be achieved within runway period):**
  - **Traction:** Demonstrate a clear, scalable, and cost-effective pathway to reaching the 3.5% survey submission goal.
  - **Financial Sustainability:** Generate enough recurring monthly income to cover all operational costs, including the Commander's own compensation.

Achieving these metrics will constitute victory in the first battle, validating the strategy and unlocking the resources to expand the team and open the next front in the War on Disease.

## Part 4: Contingency Plan

This recruitment strategy is designed to find an exceptional individual, a true unicorn. We acknowledge that such a candidate may not be found within our desired timeframe.

If a suitable Commander is not identified and commissioned within 60 days of initiating the search, the strategy will pivot:

1.  **Re-scope the Mission:** The initial objective will be reduced to building a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the "AI Recruitment Engine" with a more limited feature set.
2.  **Hire a Specialist Team:** The $60,000 war chest will be used to hire a small, elite contract team (e.g., one AI/backend engineer, one frontend engineer) for a fixed-term project to build the MVP.
3.  **Re-evaluate:** The success of the MVP will determine the next steps for funding and leadership.

This ensures that the initiative moves forward, even if the ideal commander proves elusive.
