## Recommendations for Further Consolidation

### High Priority
- `economics/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.md` - Very large file (33K+ tokens), needs careful extraction of key metrics beyond the 463:1 ROI
- Other economics files in the consolidation script mapping

### Medium Priority
- Legal/governance files consolidation
- Strategy files consolidation
- Global referendum sub-files

## Quality Assurance

- Preserved dark humor tone throughout
- Extracted only unique valuable content not already in targets
- Maintained proper attribution and source tracking
- Created consolidated files that are coherent and well-structured
- All file moves completed successfully

The consolidation successfully reduced file sprawl while preserving and enhancing the most valuable economic content in the DIH project.
