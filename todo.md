## What Was Kept (Intentionally)

### Functional Phrases
- "Here's how" (when introducing explanations)
- "Here's what" (when listing concrete items)
- "It's like" (when introducing valuable analogies)

These were KEPT when they served functional purposes:
- Transitioning to useful content
- Introducing clarifying analogies
- Setting up concrete examples

### Strategic "Bottom Line" Usage
One "Bottom Line" header was kept in problem.qmd because it effectively summarizes the entire problem section and transitions to action.

---

## Quality Standard Applied

**Text was removed if BOTH:**
1. NOT funny
2. NOT providing value

**Text was kept if EITHER:**
- Makes reader laugh
- OR helps reader understand/learn
- OR advances the book's persuasive mission

---

## Impact

✅ **Tighter prose** - Eliminated lazy cliches and corporate buzzwords
✅ **Stronger voice** - More direct, less hedging
✅ **Better flow** - Removed worthless transition headers
✅ **Maintained humor** - Kept all funny analogies and jokes
✅ **Preserved value** - Kept all educational and persuasive content

The book now has the same powerful voice with 40+ fewer lazy rhetorical crutches.

## Files Not in Book

Other .qmd files in project (outside brain/book):
- dih-index.qmd - No changes needed
- presentation.qmd - No changes needed
- landing-page.qmd - No changes needed

All checked for cliches, all clean.
