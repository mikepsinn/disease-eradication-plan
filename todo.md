# DIH Book Launch - Master To-Do List

This is the master checklist for completing and launching the book, website, and presentation. 

**UPDATED STRATEGY (2025-09-27):** Write first, research later. Focus on getting all content written with placeholder citations, then do a systematic research pass.

## Phase 0.5: DIH as Free Market Alternative to NIH Central Planning (IN PROGRESS)

### Core Conceptual Reframing: NIH = Communism, DIH = Capitalism

**NEW FRAMING:** Position DIH as the free market/capitalist alternative to NIH's Soviet-style central planning. Leverage:
- **Hayek's Information Theory**: Markets as superior information aggregation mechanisms
- **Wisdom of Crowds**: Distributed decision-making beats expert committees
- **Market Mechanisms**: Price signals, competition, and incentives vs bureaucracy
- **Blockchain Question**: Evaluate if necessary for transparency/anti-corruption

### Files to Update with Market-Based Framing:

- [ ] **Core DIH Positioning:**
    - [ ] `brain/book/solution/dih.qmd` - Reframe as market-based research funding system
    - [ ] `brain/book/solution/dfda.md` - Emphasize market competition in trials
    - [ ] `brain/book/solution/wishocracy.md` - Position as inequality-addressing mechanism within capitalist framework
    - [ ] `brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.md` - Show transition from central planning to markets

- [ ] **Problem Diagnosis (New Angle):**
    - [ ] Chapter 1.3.1 "Why NIH is Terrible" - Frame as failure of central planning
    - [ ] Add comparison: NIH grant committees = Soviet planning bureaus
    - [ ] Show information bottlenecks and misallocated resources

- [ ] **Economic Arguments:**
    - [ ] `brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd` - Markets pricing future health gains
    - [ ] `brain/book/economics/economic-impact-summary.md` - Market efficiency vs bureaucratic waste

### Key Conceptual Shifts:

1. **NIH = Central Planning Problems:**
   - Information bottlenecks (committees can't know all science)
   - Political capture and bureaucratic incentives
   - Slow adaptation to new information
   - Winner-picking by committees vs market discovery

2. **DIH = Market Solutions:**
   - Distributed knowledge aggregation (Hayek)
   - Competition between research approaches
   - Price signals for research value
   - Rapid iteration and failure tolerance

3. **Wishocracy = Addressing Market Failures:**
   - Democratic input for public goods
   - Equity considerations in pure capitalism
   - Collective wisdom for research priorities
   - Balance between efficiency and fairness

4. **Insurance Model Reconsideration:**
   - May keep as implementation detail
   - Or pivot to direct market mechanisms
   - Focus on incentives and information flow

### New Theoretical Foundations to Incorporate:

- [ ] **Hayekian Knowledge Problem**: Why NIH can't efficiently allocate $48B
- [ ] **Prediction Markets**: Could DIH use them for research prioritization?
- [ ] **Wisdom of Crowds**: James Surowiecki's principles applied to research
- [ ] **Public Choice Theory**: Why NIH serves bureaucrats, not patients
- [ ] **Mechanism Design**: Optimal incentives for medical innovation
- [ ] **Blockchain/Transparency**: Necessary or nice-to-have for anti-corruption?

### Writing Tasks:

- [ ] Draft new introduction comparing NIH to Gosplan (Soviet planning committee)
- [ ] Create comparison table: Central Planning vs Market Mechanisms in Research
- [ ] Write section on Hayek's "Use of Knowledge in Society" applied to medical research
- [ ] Develop concrete examples of market mechanisms in DIH operations
- [ ] Address "but healthcare isn't a normal market" objections
