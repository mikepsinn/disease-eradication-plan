## The Problem: We're Paying $119 Trillion to Die Badly

### Welcome to Earth's Stupidest Budget Meeting

Imagine humanity as a family making $100,000 a year. Here's what we spend:

- **$91,800** dealing with disease (mostly watching people rot, not curing them)
- **$9,700** on weapons to murder each other
- **$68** trying to cure diseases

That's right. We spend **1,750 times more** mopping up death than preventing it. It's like buying 1,600 mops instead of fixing the burst pipe.

### The $119 Trillion Death Toilet (A Breakdown)

Every year, humanity flushes **$119 trillion** down what I call the Death Toilet:

{{< include brain/figures/war-hidden-direct-curing-diseases-column-chart.qmd >}}

**The War Department**: $9.7 trillion annually

- Direct military spending: $2.72 trillion (enough nuclear bombs to end civilization 67 times)
- Rebuilding what we blew up: The rest
- The Pentagon alone has LOST $2.5 trillion. Not spent. Lost. Like couch change that could cure cancer.

**The Disease Department**: $109.1 trillion annually

- Treating symptoms forever: Most of it
- Actually curing things: A rounding error
- Insulin costs $300/vial because cured diabetics don't buy insulin (bad for business)

**The Research Department**: $68 billion annually
- That's 0.06% of the problem
- We spend more on toilet paper for the Pentagon

### Your Body Is a Broken Robot (And We Know How to Fix Robots)

Here's what nobody tells you: **Death isn't mandatory. It's just bad maintenance.**

Your body is a self-repairing meat robot:
- **Software**: DNA (buggy code we can now edit with CRISPR)
- **Hardware**: Organs (we already replace hearts like swapping hard drives)
- **Self-repair**: You build 330 billion new cells daily (your iPhone can't do that)

**Animals That Already Beat Death:**

- Hydras: Biologically immortal, been alive since before your country existed
- Naked mole rats: Don't get cancer, live 10X longer than they should, look terrible
- Bowhead whales: 200+ years old, probably know all the good sea shanties

Harvard scientists already reversed aging in mice. Made them young again. Fixed their vision. Reset their biological clocks. We're just big mice with mortgages. The technology exists. We just spend the money on bombs instead.

### The Speed of Stupidity

![Annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)

While you read this sentence, **17 people died** from preventable diseases. 

Every single day:

- **150,000 people die** (that's fifty 9/11s)
- **$137 million burns** in inefficiency
- **$196,900 per second** goes to war instead of cures

Your cancer cells are multiplying RIGHT NOW. Your telomeres are shortening. You are literally dissolving. And we're spending 40X more on new ways to kill you than cure you.

### Democracy Can't Save You

Think voting will fix this? Adorable.

Princeton analyzed 1,779 policy decisions over 20 years. The correlation between what you want and what happens? **Zero percent.**

When economic elites want something? **78% success rate.**

You have less political power than a houseplant. At least politicians water houseplants.

## The Solution: Weaponized Greed for Good

### The Stupidly Simple Idea

Take **1%** of the murder budget. Just 1%. A Pentagon rounding error.

That's $27 billion annually. We'd still have $2.69 trillion for killing (enough to murder everyone 66 times instead of 67).

### The Four-Step Master Plan

**Step 1:** Sell VICTORY Bonds to raise $1 billion (270% returns to investors)

**Step 2:** Use the money to get 280 million humans to vote YES on the 1% Treaty (that's just 3.5% of us)

**Step 3:** Spend $1 billion on legal bribes (aka "lobbying")

**Step 4:** Watch every nation redirect funds to the Decentralized Institutes of Health

### How to Get $1 Billion (Sell Hope to Rich People)

Remember war bonds? We funded WWII by promising returns to patriots. Same playbook, different war.

**VICTORY Bonds: The Best Investment Since Insider Trading**

- **Promise**: 270% annual returns
- **Better than**: Stock market (10%), Real estate (8%), Your cousin's crypto (-100%)
- **How**: We redirect $27B annually with just $1B investment (27:1 leverage, forever)
- **Why it works**: We only capture 26% of value created. Humanity keeps the other 74%.

### The Coalition of the Willing to Get Rich

**Defense Contractors**: "We can make 270% returns AND keep 99% of military budget? Sold."

**Big Pharma**: Currently burns $48,000 per trial patient. With our system, patients PAY THEM. From biggest expense to revenue stream. CEOs literally crying money tears.

**Insurance Companies**: Every cure = billions saved. They're finally betting on you living.

**Politicians**: Vote for the treaty or our Super PAC funds your opponent with graphs showing you hate cancer kids.

**Billionaires**: Cure death? Current wealth becomes pocket change.

## How It Actually Works (The Amazon-ification of Not Dying)

### Three Systems to Replace Bureaucratic Death

#### 1. The Decentralized FDA (dFDA): Amazon for Clinical Trials + Consumer Reports for Drugs

Current FDA: Soviet central planning. One committee decides everything. Takes 17 years. Costs $2.2 billion. Everyone dies waiting.

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/system-comparison-visualization.qmd >}} -->

**The dFDA Instead**:

- Browse treatments like Netflix
- Read actual patient reviews (not pharma propaganda)
- One-click enrollment from your doctor's iPad
- Oxford RECOVERY trial proved it: $500/patient vs FDA's $41,000
- That's **82X cheaper**

#### 2. The DIH: Markets Beat Committees

NIH: 200 bureaucrats pretend to know everything, reject 90% of ideas, scientists spend 60% of time begging for grants.

**DIH Instead**: 

- Patients choose what to fund (with subsidies)
- Markets pick winners, not politics
- Like Kickstarter for cancer research
- Fund 1,000 ideas, not 10

## Your Two Possible Futures

### Path A: Idiocracy (Keep Funding War)

**The Three Subs** by 2050:

- 🧠 **Sub-Intelligence**: IQ dropping, eating lead paint for nutrients
- ⏳ **Sub-Longevity**: Life expectancy 35, dying like a pirate  
- 😢 **Sub-Wellbeing**: 80% mentally ill, happiness illegal

Your kid gets cancer: You sell the house, start a GoFundMe, she dies anyway.

### Path B: Wishonia (Fund Cures Instead)

**The Three Supers** by 2050:

- 🧠 **Super-Intelligence**: Merge with AI, actually understand quantum physics
- ⏳ **Super-Longevity**: Death optional, respawn enabled
- 😊 **Super-Wellbeing**: Adjustable happiness baseline, suffering extinct

Your kid gets cancer: Doctor uploads DNA, computer designs cure, pharmacy prints it, she's fine by Thursday. Cost: $0.

## The Money Shot: Why Even Sociopaths Should Care

### The Returns That Break Capitalism

- **Investment needed**: $1 billion
- **Annual redirect**: $27 billion (forever)
- **ROI for investors**: 270% annually
- **ROI for society**: 463:1 
- **Value created**: $16.5 trillion annually at scale


### Why This Actually Works

**Oxford already proved it**: Tested COVID treatments for $500/patient. America spent $41,000/patient on paperwork.

**The math is simple**:

- Current drug development: $2.2 billion
- With competition: ~$27 million
- Efficiency gain: 82X
- Lives saved: Millions
- Jobs lost: Zero (same companies, different products)

**Everyone wins**:

- Weapons makers: Paid to make medical equipment
- Politicians: Heroes who get reelected
- Pharma: 80X more drugs to sell
- Insurance: Fewer claims to pay
- Rich people: Get richer AND live forever
- Poor people: Don't die of preventable bullshit
- You: See your grandkids graduate
- Death: Unemployed

## The Bottom Line

Humanity spends **$119 trillion annually** on death and suffering.

We're asking for **1%** of the military budget. One percent.

The military keeps 99% - enough to end the world 66 times instead of 67.

This isn't liberal or conservative. It's not capitalism or socialism. It's math.

We can keep building bombs until the sun explodes, or we can cure cancer.

We can keep treating symptoms until everyone's bankrupt, or we can eliminate disease.

We can keep being the stupidest species in the universe, or we can evolve.

The people in charge aren't evil. They just really like money. So we're going to make saving lives more profitable than ending them.

**The choice is binary:** Continue funding our extinction, or redirect 1% toward immortality.

*P.S. - We put humans on the moon with computers weaker than your phone. We split the atom. We invented spray cheese. Surely we can figure out how to stop murdering each other.*

*P.P.S. - If you're still skeptical, remember: The alternative is dying of something stupid while Jeff Bezos builds another yacht shaped like a smaller yacht.*
