# The Elevator Pitch That Ends Human Stupidity

Listen: Humanity spends **$119 TRILLION** annually on war and disease—that's like burning 119 trillion dollar bills every year while complaining about being cold. We spend $2.7 trillion building murder robots but only $68 billion trying to cure ALL DISEASES COMBINED. That's 40X more on killing each other than healing each other. Your grandma is dying of something curable while we build our 10,000th nuclear warhead.

**THE PROBLEM:** Democracy is fake (Princeton proved it—0% correlation between what you want and what happens), the FDA takes 17 years and $2.6 billion to approve one drug while 95% of diseases have ZERO treatments, and we're all dying while committees debate. The Pentagon LOST $2.5 trillion. Not spent. Lost. Like couch change, except the couch is Nebraska and the change could cure cancer 500 times over.

**THE SOLUTION:** The 1% Treaty. Every nation cuts 1% from their War on Humanity and redirects it to the **War on Disease**. That's $27 billion globally—Pentagon's couch cushion money. No country loses relative power (everyone cuts equally). We'd still have enough nukes to end civilization 66 times instead of 67.

**HOW IT WORKS:** 
1. **Wishocracy** replaces committees with 8 billion brains. You see two options: "Sarah's autism trial" vs "MIT's cancer vaccine." Swipe to allocate. Takes 5 minutes. Math happens. Perfect budget emerges. No politicians, no corruption, just humanity's actual priorities.

2. **The dFDA** is Amazon for clinical trials. Browse treatments like products, read real patient reviews, join with one click. Oxford already proved this works: $500/patient vs FDA's $41,000. That's 82X cheaper. Include everyone (not just healthy people), get results in months (not decades).

3. **The DIH** replaces the NIH's Soviet central planning with markets. Instead of 200 bureaucrats guessing, millions of patients choose which trials to fund. Money flows automatically via smart contracts. Zero gatekeepers between ideas and funding.

**THE MONEY:** VICTORY bonds. 40% annual returns forever (better than Buffett's 20%). We're selling $3.375 billion to fund lobbying for the treaty. Once passed, bondholders get 5% of all DIH inflows perpetually. It's like Bitcoin but instead of wasting electricity, we're curing cancer.

**WHY EVERYONE WINS:**
- **Defense contractors:** Keep 99% of budget PLUS 40% returns on VICTORY bonds
- **Big Pharma:** Patients PAY THEM for trials (covered by DIH subsidies) instead of burning $48,000/patient
- **Politicians:** We fund their campaigns if they support it, their opponents if they don't
- **Insurance companies:** Every cure = billions they don't pay out
- **You:** Your diseases actually get cured, healthcare becomes free through trial participation

**THE MATH:**
- Investment: $40M platform cost
- Return: $50B annual savings from efficiency
- ROI: 463:1 for society, 40% for investors
- Lives saved: 180,000 annually from just 1%
- Timeline: 2-3 years to market vs 17 years

**HISTORICAL PROOF:** The Oxford RECOVERY trial tested COVID treatments for $500/patient while America spent $41,000 on paperwork. Oxford saved a million lives. America saved a million forms. Pre-1962, 144,000 doctors ran successful trials through JAMA. Then FDA centralized everything, drug costs went up 35X, approvals dropped 70%. We're just undoing that catastrophe.

**THE ENDGAME:** Success creates hunger for more. Year 1: Major advances in 15 diseases. Year 5: 5% treaty. Year 20: War looks as insane as human sacrifice. Death becomes optional. We become the first species to defeat its own mortality through weaponized capitalism pointed at biology instead of each other.

**THE ASK:** We need 3.5% of humanity (280 million people) to click "YES" on "Do you want to not die?" History shows 3.5% active support = peaceful revolution succeeds. We make it profitable: participate in trials, get paid. Vote for budget allocation, get power. Buy VICTORY bonds, get rich.

**WHY NOW:** Every day we wait, 150,671 people die from preventable disease. That's fifty 9/11s. While you read this pitch, 17 people died. The daily holocaust of inaction costs $137 million in burnt efficiency and 2,301 Quality-Adjusted Life Years.

**THE CHOICE:** Keep building bombs until the sun explodes, or cure cancer. Keep treating symptoms until everyone's bankrupt, or eliminate disease. Keep being the stupidest species in the universe (spending money to kill ourselves), or try literally anything else.

This isn't liberal or conservative. It's math. We put humans on the moon with computers weaker than your phone. We split the atom. We invented cheese in a can. Surely we can figure out how to stop murdering each other with the money we could use to live forever.
