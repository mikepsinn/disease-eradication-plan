# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the future direction and planned features for "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ending War and Disease." It serves as a central place to understand our priorities for versions beyond the initial Minimum Viable Book (MVB).

## v2 and Beyond

The primary goal of the first version is to deliver a concise, compelling, and complete argument. Many valuable topics, deeper dives, and additional analyses have been intentionally deferred to future versions to maintain this focus.

## How We Track Ideas

All future work, feature requests, and ideas are tracked as **[Issues in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/dih/dih/issues)**.

This approach allows for:
- Detailed discussion on each specific topic.
- Prioritization and transparent progress tracking.
- Community contributions and feedback.

If you have an idea for a new chapter, a request for a more detailed economic model, or any other suggestion, please **[open an issue](https://github.com/dih/dih/issues/new)**.
