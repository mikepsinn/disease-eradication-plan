# Project Roadmap: Decentralized Health Research & Development Platform

## North Star Objective
To establish a global public good that transforms how all diseases are studied and cured by building a hyper-efficient, patient-centric ecosystem for medical innovation.

## High-Level Budget & Timeline
- **Total Grant Allocation:** $600,000
- **Total Estimated Duration:** 20 Months
- **Average Monthly Spend:** ~$30,000

## Phased Execution Plan

This project will be executed in four distinct phases. Each phase will be governed by a separate Statement of Work (SOW) executed under the Master Service Agreement. This structure provides regular checkpoints for review and ensures fiscal accountability.

### **Phase 1: The Blueprint & Strategic Analysis**
*   **Objective:** Conduct all foundational research to create a comprehensive strategic, economic, and legal blueprint. This de-risks the entire project before significant technical development begins.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  Health & Economic Impact Analysis (QALY model).
    2.  Detailed Economic & Governance Model (Voucher system, insurance framework).
    3.  Comprehensive Legal, Regulatory & Treaty Framework Analysis.
    4.  A high-level technical architecture document and a detailed roadmap for subsequent development phases.
*   **Status:** **Current Phase** (Governed by `SOW-01_Strategic_Blueprint.md`)
*   **Estimated Cost:** **$120,000**
*   **Estimated Duration:** **4 months**

### **Phase 2: Core dFDA Infrastructure Prototype**
*   **Objective:** Build the core technical engine of the platform, focusing on the most complex privacy, security, and data integrity components.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  Working prototype of the "Digital Twin Safe" using Zero-Knowledge Proofs.
    2.  Prototype of the patient consent management system.
    3.  Prototype of the multi-signature treasury controls for financial transparency.
*   **Status:** Pending
*   **Estimated Cost:** **$210,000**
*   **Estimated Duration:** **7 months**

### **Phase 3: Intelligence & Governance Layer Prototypes**
*   **Objective:** Develop the "brains" and "voice" of the platform—the AI-driven systems and the user-facing democratic allocation tools.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  Prototype of the AI-driven treatment matching and side-effect prediction algorithms.
    2.  Prototype of the Wishocracy platform, including the voting interface and identity verification mechanisms.
*   **Status:** Pending
*   **Estimated Cost:** **$210,000**
*   **Estimated Duration:** **7 months**

---

### **Phase 4: Integration & Public Launchpad**
*   **Objective:** Integrate the core prototypes and develop the initial public-facing materials needed to begin building a community and preparing for a pilot.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    1.  Basic integration of the dFDA, AI, and Wishocracy prototypes.
    2.  Creation of initial public education materials (white papers, explainers).
    3.  A finalized, detailed implementation plan for a live pilot (to be defined in a future SOW).
*   **Status:** Pending
*   **Estimated Cost:** **$60,000**
*   **Estimated Duration:** **2 months**
