## Contributor Workflow

The plan _is_ the repository. We're building a book that's so clear anyone can read it.

1.  **Set up your environment:** Follow the [Development Environment Setup](GUIDES/TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md#development-environment-setup).
2.  **Find something to improve:** Look at the `todo.md` for priorities.
3.  **If changing book structure:** Update the [Book Outline in README.md](./README.md#book-outline) first.
4.  **Make your changes:** Fork the repo and create a branch, or just edit on GitHub if you're not technical.
5.  **Follow the standards:** Use the rules in this document and the specialized guides.
6.  **Submit a pull request:** Explain how your change makes things better.

## Automation and CI

- **Link Checker:** Pull requests with dead internal links will fail.
- **Frontmatter Validator:** Pull requests will fail if required frontmatter fields are missing.
