# Writing Style Guide

**The Tone: Dark Humor Meets Practical Hope**

We're writing "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ending War and Disease" - a book that uses dark humor, absurd observations, and irrefutable facts to trick humanity into not killing itself. Think Kurt Vonnegut explaining economics to drunk people at a funeral.

**The 4 Core Checks:**

1.  **Clarity:** Can I say this to my mom and have her understand?
2.  **Credibility:** Would I stake my reputation on this claim?
3.  **Concision:** Can I cut words without losing meaning?
4.  **Directness:** Does this sound like Kurt Vonnegut wrote it?

**Essential Elements to Include:**

-   **Dark humor about death and human stupidity** - We're all dying anyway, might as well laugh
-   **Cynical but loving observations about humanity** - We're idiots, but we're OUR idiots
-   **Simple, conversational language** - No jargon, write like you're explaining to a smart drunk friend
-   **Absurd but accurate analogies** - "The FDA is like a lifeguard who checks if the life preserver is safe while you drown"
-   **A sense of cosmic irony** - The universe is laughing at us, we might as well join in
-   **Practical solutions presented as obvious common sense** - "What if sick people could just... try treatments?"

**Automatic Red Flags (Rewrite Immediately):**

-   **Corporate Buzzwords:** "synergy," "activation," "paradigm shift," "stakeholder," "utilize," "facilitate" "world-class," "revolutionary," "unprecedented", "cutting-edge," "state-of-the-art," "best-in-class"
-   **Trying to sound important:** Write like you're explaining this to a smart friend who thinks you might be crazy
-   **Euphemisms for death:** Just say "die" or "death" - we're adults here
-   **Academic pomposity:** If you sound like a textbook, rewrite it

**The Voice Test:** Would this make someone laugh AND think? If not, add more absurdity or more facts.

**Voice and Tone: Principled, Blunt, and Credible**

**The Target and the Tone: Aim at the System, Speak to the "Us"**

The style of this project must balance two core principles: genuine outrage and radical inclusivity.

1.  **The Target of Outrage is the System, Not the People:** Our fight is with broken systems, not with the individuals trapped within them. The tone should be one of profound anger at the inefficiency, waste, and tragedy of our current institutions. It should not be a partisan or personal attack on any group. The goal is to critique a broken machine that *we* can all work together to fix.

2.  **We're All In This Together:** The writing should always assume the reader is a potential partner and a co-owner of the project. It should use terms like "we," "us," "our" to create a sense of a massive, collective movement that includes all of humanity. The goal is to make the reader feel like they are being invited to join a powerful rebellion, not being lectured or sold to. The reader is part of the "us" from the first sentence.

-   **Assume self-interest, not idealism.** Ground every argument in Public Choice Theory.
    -   **Good:** "Politicians support this because we fund their campaigns and their opponents if they don't."
    -   **Bad:** "World leaders will embrace this plan because it's the right thing to do."
-   **Use blunt language, not euphemisms.** Call things by their real names, but maintain technical precision where it adds clarity.
    -   **Good:** "How to stay out of prison," "We're bribing everyone."
    -   **Bad:** "Legal compliance," "Incentive alignment."
    -   **Good and Precise:** "Transparent, automated, outcome-driven institutions" is better than "computer systems" because it specifies *what kind* of systems and *why* they matter.

**One-Second Test:** If you hesitate before reading a sentence aloud to a skeptical audience, rewrite it.
