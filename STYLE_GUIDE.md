# Writing Style Guide

**The Tone: Dark Humor Meets Practical Hope**

We're writing "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ending War and Disease" - a book that uses dark humor, absurd observations, and irrefutable facts to trick humanity into not killing itself. Think Douglas Adams and Kurt Vonnegut explaining economics to drunk people at a funeral.

## Core Principles

-   **Target the System, Not the People:** Our fight is with broken systems, not the individuals trapped within them. The tone should be one of profound anger at the inefficiency, waste, and tragedy of our current institutions, not a partisan or personal attack.
-   **We're All In This Together:** Always use "we," "us," and "our" to create a sense of a massive, collective movement that includes all of humanity. The reader is part of the "us" from the first sentence.
-   **Assume Self-Interest, Not Idealism:** Ground every argument in Public Choice Theory. Frame solutions around concrete incentives ("What's in it for them?"), not abstract moral appeals.

## The Writer's Toolkit: Dos and Don'ts

### DO:

-   **Use dark humor about death and human stupidity.** 
-   **Make cynical but loving observations about humanity.** We're idiots, but we're OUR idiots.
-   **Use simple, conversational language.** No jargon. Write like you're explaining something to a smart friend who might think you're crazy.
-   **Create absurd but accurate analogies.** "The FDA is like a lifeguard who checks if the life preserver is safe while you drown."
-   **Embrace cosmic irony.** 
-   **Present solutions as obvious common sense.** "What if sick people could just... try treatments?"

### DON'T:

-   **Use corporate buzzwords or academic jargon.** Avoid "synergy," "paradigm shift," "stakeholder," "utilize," "facilitate."
-   **Try to sound important.** Write like a human, not a textbook.
-   **Use euphemisms.** Call things by their real names. Just say "die" or "death."

## The Final Check

-   **Clarity:** Can my mom understand this?
-   **Credibility:** Would I stake my reputation on this claim?
-   **Concision:** Can I cut words without losing meaning?
-   **Directness:** Does this sound like Kurt Vonnegut or Douglas Adams wrote it?
-   **Impact:** Does it make someone laugh AND think?
-   **Confidence:** Do I hesitate before reading it aloud to a skeptic?
