# The Problem in Numbers

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="60%"}
| What We Waste | Annual Cost |
|---------------|-------------|
| Disease Burden | $109.1T |
| War & Conflict | $9.7T |
| **Total Waste** | **$118.8T** |
| **Finding Cures** | **$0.068T** |
::::

:::: {.column width="40%"}
We spend **1,600X more** treating disease than curing it.

That's like buying 1,600 mops instead of fixing the pipe.

# Part I: Your Democracy Is Dead {.center}

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## Key Points
- Evolution trapped us in violence (warrior genes)
- $119T spent on war + disease annually
- Democracy is mathematically broken (Princeton study)
- You have 0% influence on policy

# Part II: Why Markets Beat Committees {.center}

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## The Theory
- Central planning kills (Soviet famines, FDA delays)
- Markets aggregate knowledge better than bureaucrats
- Public choice: Everyone acts in self-interest
- Wisdom of crowds: 8B brains > 200 experts

# Part III: The Solution (Wishocracy) {.center}

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## The 1% Treaty
- Redirect 1% of military spending ($27B/year)
- Wishocracy: Pairwise voting on health priorities
- DIH subsidizes patient participation
- dFDA marketplace: Amazon for clinical trials

**Cost:** $500/patient (vs $41,000 FDA standard)
**Time:** 2 years (vs 17 years)
**Access:** 100% (vs 15%)

# Part IV: The Economics {.center}

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## VICTORY Bonds
- 40% annual returns (better than Medallion Fund)
- $3.375B total issuance (scarce)
- 5% of all DIH inflows forever
- Scales as treaty expands (1% → 2% → 5%)

# Part V: The Implementation {.center}

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## 3-Step Plan
1. **Prove Mandate:** 280M signatures (3.5% of humanity)
2. **Fund Mission:** $2.5B via VICTORY Bonds
3. **Ratify Treaty:** Lobbying + public pressure

# Part VI: This Already Works {.center}

::: {.content-visible when-format="revealjs"}
## Oxford RECOVERY Trial
- **Cost:** $500 per patient
- **FDA Standard:** $41,000 per patient
- **Efficiency:** 82X better
- **Lives Saved:** 1 million+
- **Time:** Months, not years

**Proof:** Decentralization works. We just need to scale it.

# Part VII: Choose Your Future

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
### Path A: Gollumland
- AI optimized for killing
- Crime economy > productive economy
- Cybercrime unpunished
- Currency collapse
- Life expectancy: 35 years
- **The Three Subs:** Sub-intelligence, Sub-longevity, Sub-wellbeing
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### Path B: Wishonia
- AI optimized for healing
- Disease becomes optional
- Death becomes optional
- Universal prosperity
- Life expectancy: Choose your age
- **The Three Supers:** Super-intelligence, Super-longevity, Super-wellbeing
:::
::::

**The difference:** One 1% budget reallocation in 2026.

# Call to Action {.center background-color="#e74c3c"}

## Three Things You Can Do Today

::: {.incremental}
1. **Sign** the global referendum at **WarOnDisease.org** (3 minutes)
2. **Invest** in VICTORY Bonds - 40% perpetual returns (if you have capital)
3. **Build** with us - developers, organizers, educators (if you have skills)
:::

---

# Why This Will Work {.center}

::: {.incremental}
- **Not ideological:** Math, not politics
- **Everyone profits:** Defense contractors, pharma, patients, investors
- **Already proven:** Oxford did it, we're scaling it
- **Unstoppable at 3.5%:** Historical precedent (civil rights, suffrage)
:::

:::{.notes}
This is the pitch. Keep it simple. Show them the door. Get them to act.

# Appendix: The Math

**Investment:** $2.5B (VICTORY Bonds)
**Annual Return:** $27B (1% treaty) → $135B (5% treaty)
**ROI:** 10:1 annually, scaling with treaty expansion
**Lives Saved:** 180,000+ annually at 1%, millions at scale

**This isn't charity. This is the best investment in human history.**
