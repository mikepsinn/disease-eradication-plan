## The Problem in Numbers

| What We Waste Money On | Annual Cost | What We Get |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| War & Conflict | $9.7T | Destruction, refugees, and disabilities |
| Disease Burden | $109.1T | Suffering and lost potential |
| **Total Waste** | **$118.8T** | **The dumbest possible use of our limited resources** |
| **Medical Research**| **$0.068T** | Actual cures and treatments |

## The 1% Solution

1.  **Nations redirect 1%** of military budgets to cure disease
2.  **Patients get paid** to participate in clinical trials
3.  **Research becomes 80x more efficient** using proven methods
4.  **EVERYONE profits** from the $16.5T annual peace dividend
