Hi, Allison!  

Thanks for your patience! I wanted to put together a comprehensive health and economic model and plan before wasting your valuable time with my handwaving. 

So, according to this preliminary model at https://impact.dih.earth (which I would love criticism of), if one were to simply run a large-scale research and educational survey that eventually led to 1% of global military spending being reallocated to subsidize patient participation in hyper-efficient pragmatic trials, one would:
Increase annual trial capacity (the primary bottleneck to medical progress) by 25X (given less than 1% of willing patients are currently able to participate in trials, and we have a backlog of over 10k proven safe treatments that have never been tested for the majority of potential conditions they could improve)
This would enable over 500 years' worth of clinical research in 20 years.  A ubiquitous pragmatic trial system that allows any patient to join Phase 2-4 efficacy trials (after Phase 1 safety is proven) through standard healthcare would advance access to new cures by 8.2 years for most patients.  This 8.2 shift would be on top of any acceleration from increased trial capacity and the lowering of the cost barrier, making many currently economically unviable treatments suddenly viable.  So 8.2 years is a likely floor.  And you don’t need to know when the cure will occur for that.
Based on annual deaths and burden of eventually curable diseases, this 1% shift would eventually save over 416 million lives for $0.13/DALY (over 600X more cost-effective than malaria bed nets)
Tractability: Based on these numbers, even if there is only a 1% chance of success the expected value is still 6X higher than the next best alternative (bed nets)

Draft Proposal (Criticism Appreciated)

Step 1.  Determine if these numbers are actually correct. You and any other economists you know who might be interested in being contributors/co-authors saving 416 million lives, quickly do a sanity check on the model/parameters/uncertainty distributions, etc. at https://impact.dih.earth/knowledge/appendix/parameters-and-calculations and add inline comments using the hypothes.is integrated comment system. 

Step 2. We incorporate suggestions until it’s something you and others would be willing to put your name on.  If we get to this point, you then decide if you want to abandon or move to Step 3.

Step 3. I help to create presentation materials based on the data and you could present to potential large donors (Gates Foundation, etc.) to support a Foresight Clinical Trial Abundance Initiative (or whatever framing you’re comfortable with). This iniative would be used to fund your efforts to get as close to 280M responses to this 2 question completely 501c3 compliant research and educational survey at https://www.trialabundancesurvey.org as possible through advertising, referral rewards, persuading other orgs to share with their members, etc.

Step 4. We run the survey. The most similar existing surveys suggest the public would desire an allocation of at least 50% to medical research and less than 50% to weapons and military systems.  Thus the proposal to move the actual allocation from 95% military to 94% military is at least 40X less radical than what the public actually wants. 

Step 5. 501c4’s and others present this information to policy makers. If the world is actually comprised of mostly representative democracies, this would result in policy adoption.  If the desires of humanity are not sufficient to transform the utility function of politicians sufficient for policy adoption, you then decide if you want to help find external non-501c3 partners to help with step 6. 

Step 6. Optimize Incentive Alignment Bond Archtecture - This draft proposes a mechanism to solve the diffuse costs/concentrated benefits problem by adjusting the utility function of politicians to include
