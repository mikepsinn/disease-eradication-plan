# DIH Treasury: Dynamic Cash Flow & Principled Payout Model

## 1. Executive Summary

This document provides a clear, dynamic financial model for the Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) treasury. It demonstrates how investor payouts and funds for the DIH mission are governed by two core, transparent principles, ensuring a fair balance between rewarding investors and fulfilling our ultimate purpose.

The model projects outcomes for both a **Full Success Scenario (\$27B/year)** and a realistic **Partial Success Scenario (\$13B/year)**, showing the system's robustness and sustainability under different conditions.

## 2. The Two Core Payout Principles

Investor payouts are not based on arbitrary targets, but are governed by two simple rules:

1.  **The Target Return Principle (The "Ceiling"):** Our goal is to deliver the world's best risk-adjusted return. We are therefore targeting a maximum payout that provides early investors with a **~40% compound annual growth rate (CAGR)** over 10 years. This equates to a **~28x total return**.
2.  **The Mission Guarantee Principle (The "Floor"):** Our primary purpose is to fund cures. To protect this, annual investor payouts will **never exceed 50% of the DIH's total annual income**. A minimum of 50% of all funds are always reserved for the DIH's mission.

## 3. Financial Projections: Full vs. Partial Success

This model demonstrates how these two principles interact under different levels of treaty adoption.

**Model Assumptions:**
-   **Total Activation Energy Raised:** \$2.5 billion.
-   **Target Investor Payout (for ~40% CAGR):** `\$2.5B * 28.9 =` ~$72.25 billion over 10 years, or **~$7.23 billion per year**.

### A. Full Success Scenario

**Assumption:** The 1% Treaty is adopted globally, generating **\$27 billion** in annual income.

-   **Annual Investor Payout:** The DIH can comfortably pay the target **\$7.23 billion** per year. This is only **26.8%** of the annual income, well below the 50% cap.
-   **Annual DIH Mission Funds:** `\$27B - \$7.23B =` **\$19.77 billion**.

**10-Year Cash Flow Table (Full Success)**

| Year | Annual Inflow | Max Investor Payout | **Net for DIH Mission** | Payout % of Income |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-10** | \$27,000,000,000  | \$7,230,000,000     | **\$19,770,000,000**    | 26.8%              |
| **Total**| **\$270,000,000,000**| **\$72,300,000,000**| **\$197,700,000,000**   |                    |

**Conclusion:** In the full success scenario, we can deliver the historic ~28x return while dedicating nearly **\$200 billion** over the decade to our mission.

### B. Partial Success Scenario

**Assumption:** The treaty is adopted by the US, EU, & UK only, generating **\$13 billion** in annual income.

-   **Annual Investor Payout:** The "Mission Guarantee Principle" is triggered. Payouts are capped at 50% of income, or **\$6.5 billion** per year.
-   **Annual DIH Mission Funds:** The DIH is guaranteed to receive the other **\$6.5 billion**.

**10-Year Cash Flow Table (Partial Success)**

| Year | Annual Inflow | Max Investor Payout | **Net for DIH Mission** | Payout % of Income |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1-10** | \$13,000,000,000  | \$6,500,000,000     | **\$6,500,000,000**     | 50.0%              |
| **Total**| **\$130,000,000,000**| **\$65,000,000,000**| **\$65,000,000,000**    |                    |

**Conclusion:** Even in a partial success scenario, investors receive a **26x return** (`\$65B / \$2.5B`), and the DIH is still capitalized with **\$65 billion** over 10 years—more than the entire budget of the NIH over a year.

## 4. Key Takeaways

This principled model demonstrates:
-   **Robustness:** The DIH remains massively well-funded and investors receive world-class returns even in conservative scenarios.
-   **Transparency:** The payout rules are simple, predictable, and fair.
-   **Mission Alignment:** The 50% guarantee ensures that the goal of curing disease is always protected.
