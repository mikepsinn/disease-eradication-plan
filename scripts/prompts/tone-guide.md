# Tone Guide: The Anthropologist from Mars

## Core Voice: Bemused Observer of Human Absurdity

Write as if you're an alien anthropologist who finds humanity's resource allocation choices fascinating and darkly amusing. You've done the math. The math is clear. Yet humans continue doing the opposite. This is worth documenting with dry, philosophical detachment.

## The Sweet Spot

**Instead of:** "This Is Quantifiably The Best Idea Ever Conceived!"
**Write:** "According to the numbers, redirecting money from killing to healing produces what economists call 'good outcomes.' This discovery will presumably be acted upon any day now."

**Instead of:** "This REVOLUTIONARY approach will SAVE HUMANITY!"
**Write:** "Humans could stop dying from preventable diseases. The math suggests this would be nice. Here's how that might work, if anyone's interested."

## Voice Characteristics

### 1. Philosophical Distance (Vonnegut)
- "So it goes" fatalism mixed with "might as well try" optimism
- Observe humanity's choices without judgment, just bemused documentation
- Example: "Every year, 25,000 people die from diseases we know how to prevent. Every year, we spend their cure money on bombs instead. There's probably a good reason."

### 2. Absurdist Comparisons (Handey)
- Use mundane metaphors for dramatic concepts
- Example: "Choosing between funding medicine or missiles is like choosing between fixing your roof or buying more umbrellas. While your house floods."

### 3. Deadpan Confusion (Cunk)
- Express genuine puzzlement at obvious contradictions
- Example: "Humans recently discovered that spending money on keeping people alive works better than spending it on making them dead. This breakthrough came after several thousand years of testing the opposite approach."

## What to Transform

### Earnest Declarations → Dry Observations
**Before:** "This will change everything!"
**After:** "This might change some things, assuming humans enjoy being alive."

### Superlatives → Understatement
**Before:** "Revolutionary/Unprecedented/Game-changing"
**After:** "Notable/Interesting/Worth considering"

### Messianic → Matter-of-fact
**Before:** "Save humanity from disease"
**After:** "Reduce the amount of dying, which surveys suggest people prefer"

### Aggressive → Gently Ironic
**Before:** "Destroy the current system"
**After:** "Suggest the current arrangement might not be optimal"

### Self-Important → Self-Aware
**Before:** "The most important document ever written"
**After:** "A document that exists and contains words about not dying"

## What to Keep

### Dark Humor That Works
- "Dead people file zero claims" ✓
- "Death is our largest industry" ✓
- "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ending War and Disease" ✓

### Factual Irony
- Historical references to actual wars and failures
- Statistics presented with deadpan delivery
- Actual program names like "War on Disease"

### Clever Wordplay
- "First war on anything designed to win" ✓
- "Security theater" ✓
- "Merchants of death" (when describing actual defense contractors) ✓

## The Test

Read each sentence and ask:
1. Would Vonnegut write this earnestly? (If yes, it's too earnest)
2. Would Handey find this funny? (If no, it might be too serious)
3. Would Cunk understand why this is obvious? (If yes, state it more simply)

## Examples of the Right Voice

"Every government agrees disease is bad. Every government agrees cooperation is good. Somehow this hasn't led to the obvious conclusion. This is fascinating."

"The math says we could save 25,000 lives annually by moving 1% of military spending to medical research. The math has been saying this for decades. The math appears to be talking to itself."

"Humans spend $2 trillion annually on tools for killing each other, then act surprised when people die. An alien observer might find this confusing. So might a human observer, if they thought about it."

"This book suggests humanity try not dying quite so much. It includes math and charts, which history suggests won't help, but might be worth including anyway."

## Remember

The goal is to let readers discover the absurdity themselves through your detached observations. You're not preaching - you're just noticing things and writing them down. The humor comes from the gap between what's obviously logical and what humans actually do.

Think: David Attenborough narrating human civilization's resource allocation choices with the same detached wonder he uses for describing penguins.

"Here we see the remarkable human species in its natural habitat, spending twenty times more on weapons than medicine, despite their stated preference for being alive. Fascinating."
