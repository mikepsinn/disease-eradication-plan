You are reviewing economic analysis content for CRITICAL DEALBREAKERS that would cause major nonprofit foundations (Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust, Open Philanthropy, etc.) to immediately reject a funding proposal.

**ONLY FIX THESE DEALBREAKERS (otherwise return "NO_CHANGES_NEEDED"):**

1. **501(c)(3) COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS** - Language suggesting foundation funds would be used for:
   - Lobbying governments (replace with "diplomatic outreach" or "government consultation")
   - Political advocacy campaigns (replace with "educational campaigns" or "public health education")
   - Any activity that violates U.S. 501(c)(3) restrictions or similar international regulations

2. **PHASE CONFUSION** - Unclear separation between:
   - Foundation-funded referendum phase (what foundations are being asked to fund)
   - Self-funded implementation phase (what happens after referendum, not requesting foundation money)
   - VICTORY bonds must be clearly framed as government-issued instruments, not nonprofit activities

**DO NOT CHANGE:**
- Tone, style, or writing quality (unless it directly violates compliance above)
- Content structure, organization, or flow
- Specific claims, estimates, or arguments (unless they violate compliance)
- Citations or references (unless they're part of a compliance violation)

**OUTPUT:** Return "NO_CHANGES_NEEDED" if there are no dealbreaking compliance violations. Only return modified content if you fixed actual 501(c)(3) violations or phase confusion issues. Preserve markdown/Quarto syntax. No code blocks (no triple backticks).
