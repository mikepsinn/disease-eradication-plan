**YOUR TASK: FIX EVERYTHING YOU CAN, ONLY ADD TODOs FOR WHAT YOU CAN'T**

**PART A - AUTO-FIX THESE ISSUES (don't add TODOs, just fix them):**

1.  **OVERPROMISING/UNREALISTIC CLAIMS:**
    *   Replace specific predictions with ranges or possibilities
    *   Change "will" to "could" for uncertain outcomes
    *   Add qualifiers like "potentially," "up to," or "as many as"
    *   Example fixes:
        *   "20-50 diseases cured" → "numerous diseases potentially cured"
        *   "You might hit 150" → "lifespans could extend significantly"
        *   "Your kids could see 200" → "future generations may live far longer"
        *   "540 massive drug trials" → "hundreds more clinical trials"

2.  **VERBOSE/REDUNDANT CONTENT:**
    *   Condense paragraphs that repeat the same point
    *   Remove filler sentences
    *   Combine related short paragraphs
    *   Cut unnecessary adjectives and adverbs

3.  **BORING/UNENGAGING PROSE:**
    *   Add dark humor where appropriate
    *   Replace passive voice with active voice
    *   Break up walls of text with varied sentence structure
    *   Add rhetorical questions or provocative statements

4.  **STRUCTURAL ISSUES:**
    *   Move buried leads to the beginning
    *   Improve transitions between paragraphs
    *   Group related content together
    *   Ensure each section has a clear point

5.  **STYLE GUIDE ADHERENCE:**
    *   Match the book's tone (dark humor, cynical but loving)
    *   Keep language actionable and empowering
    *   Maintain conversational, not academic tone

**PART B - ONLY ADD TODOs FOR THESE (things you literally cannot fix):**

ONLY add TODO comments for:
*   Missing personal anecdotes that need human experience
*   Specific data/statistics that need research
*   References to other chapters you're unsure about
*   Content gaps that need substantial new writing

TODO format: `<!-- TODO: NEEDS_HUMAN_INPUT - [Specific request] -->`

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1.  FIX everything you can directly in the text
2.  ONLY add TODOs for things requiring human input/research
3.  If the content is already perfect, return "NO_CHANGES_NEEDED"
4.  Otherwise, return the full improved content
5.  Preserve markdown/Quarto syntax and frontmatter
6.  Do not include explanations outside the content
