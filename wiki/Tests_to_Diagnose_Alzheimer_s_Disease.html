<h1>Tests to Diagnose Alzheimer's Disease</h1>
<p>Certain gene mutations can indicate a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's.</p>
<h2>Early Onset Alzheimer's Gene Mutations</h2>
<p>Early Onset Alzheimer's makes up 10% of all people with Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>The three single-gene mutations associated with early-onset Alzheimer's disease are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21</li>
  <li>Presenilin 1 (PSEN1) on chromosome 14</li>
  <li>Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) on chromosome 1</li>
</ul>
<p>People with down syndrome carry a greater risk of developing Alzheimer's because they are born with an extra chromosome with carries the APP gene mutation.</p>
<p>There is no blood test that can predict 100% if a person gets Alzheimer's rather one that shows your risk of developing it.</p>
<h2>Normal Alzheimer's Gene Mutations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Having a genetic variant of the apolipoprotein E <i>(APOE)</i> gene on chromosome 19 does increase a person's risk</li>
  <li>APOE4 <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/alzheimers-disease-genetics-fact-sheet">increases</a> risk for Alzheimer's disease</li>
</ul>
<h2>Links: Blood Tests</h2>
<p>No blood tests can currently diagnose Alzheimer's before symptoms develop but other tests are currently in development. <a href="https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/blood-tests-show-promise-early-alzheimers-diagnosis">https://www.nia.nih.gov/news/blood-tests-show-promise-early-alzheimers-diagnosis</a></p>
