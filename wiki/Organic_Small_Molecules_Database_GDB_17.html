<h1>Organic Small Molecules Database GDB-17</h1>
<p>Exscientia is just one of a growing number of groups in industry and academia that are turning to computers to explore the mind-bogglingly large chemical universe. Chemists estimate that 10<sup>60</sup> compounds with drug-like characteristics could be made that's more small molecules than there are atoms in the Solar System. The hope is that algorithms will catalog, characterize and compare the properties of millions of compounds <i>in silico</i> to help researchers quickly and affordably find the best drug candidates for a target. Proponents argue that these strategies could make medicines safer, ensure that fewer drugs fail in clinical trials, and enable the discovery of new classes of therapeutics. They could also help to open up areas of chemical space left unexplored or assumed to be barren.</p>
