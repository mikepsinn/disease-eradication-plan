<p><strong>API Documentation</strong></p>
<p>Humana offers a variety of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to help you make data more manageable, accessible, and valuable for clients and consumers. This list will continue to grow as more APIs become available.</p>
<h3>Being RESTful</h3>
<p>Humana APIs follow the Representational state transfer (REST) format, allowing resources (accounts, clients, etc) to be standardized with a uniform set of <code>GET, POST, PUT, DELETE HTTP</code> requests. Communication with Humana follows the REST architecture constraints, including being stateless &amp; cacheable. All responses are returned as JSON objects.</p>
<h3>Swagger</h3>
<p>Swagger is used to describing and documenting RESTful APIs. More information can be found at Swagger.IO</p>
<h3>FHIR</h3>
<p>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources is a standard for data formats for application programming interfaces for exchanging health information. More information can be found at HL7.org/FHIR</p>
<h3>Endpoints</h3>
<p>Humana is a multi_tenated environment, with all tenants having access to their own sub_domain. To make a request to a tenant, use the pattern <code>?.humana.com/api/</code>.</p>
<h3>Posting data</h3>
<p>API requests which post data can either use url_encoding or json to enter data. The content_type header must be set &nbsp;<code>"application/json"</code> for the json request. The following two example shows the two methods for posting data. Note that for some requests, much more information can be posted using the json input that is available with url_encoding, but all url_encoded requests are supported with their json equivalents.</p>
