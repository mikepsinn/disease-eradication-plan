<h1>GNU Health</h1>
<p>The GNU Health project provides the tools for individuals, health professionals, institutions, and governments to proactively assess and improve the underlying determinants of health, from the socioeconomic agents to the molecular basis of disease. From primary health care to precision medicine.</p>
<p>GNU Health is a Libre, community-driven project from GNU Solidario, a non-profit humanitarian organization focused on Social Medicine. Our project has been adopted by multilateral organizations to national public health systems around the world.</p>
