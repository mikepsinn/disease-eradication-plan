<p>The DMT and ayahuasca experience are often called a <a href="https://kahpi.net/meeting-the-dmt-trip-entities-in-art/">journey or trip</a> as it gives the sensation of going on an epic expedition of the soul.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The DMT trip includes the classic psychedelic effects of holographic rainbow patterns, time and space distortions, and emotional intensities. But it usually includes an extra element.</p>
<p>People who take DMT often report encountering and interacting with beings, spirits, extradimensional aliens, or figures of the mind (*choose a word that suits your belief system).&nbsp;<a href="https://kahpi.net/dmt-art-trip-entities/"><strong>Artists</strong></a> and <a href="https://kahpi.net/mind-blowing-ayahuasca-dmt-visuals/"><strong>video animators</strong></a> have been busy trying to depict their inner DMT visions in mind-bending artworks. And wordsmiths have been ascribing their visions <i>en masse</i>. You can read hundreds of descriptions of DMT experiences at <a href="https://erowid.org/chemicals/dmt/dmt.shtml"><strong>Erowid</strong></a>.</p>
<p>But many profess that the only way to possibly know the DMT experience is to tackle it head-on.&nbsp;<br>Author <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/new-psychedelics-research-is-on-a-knife-edge-of-meaning"><strong>Erik Davis put it well</strong></a>: “Like our loving and like our dying, our [psychedelic] trips are ultimately known if anything is ultimately known at all, from the inside”.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To study its safety and the medicinal and religious elements of DMT,&nbsp;<a href="https://kahpi.net/rick-strassman-dmt-the-spirit-molecule/"><strong>Dr. Rick Strassman</strong></a> conducted research at the University of New Mexico in the 1990s. He gave 50+ people 600 doses of DMT over a period of several years.</p>
<p>He discovered that the molecule is biologically very safe and not harmful to the body. Recent research has shown that DMT has anxiolytic or antianxiety <a href="https://kahpi.net/ayahuasca-brain-effects/"><strong>effects on the brain</strong></a> and that it grows new brain cells in the hippocampus (which is an area of the brain important for memory and imagination).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ayahuasca brew (which contains DMT) has recently shown promise in helping heal <a href="https://kahpi.net/ayahuasca-tea-rapidly-helps-severe-depression/"><strong>treatment-resistant depression</strong></a>&nbsp;in a pioneering study in Brazil.</p>
<p>But with its soul-expanding qualities, DMT can be extremely psychologically challenging.</p>
<h2><strong>DMT and “bad trips”</strong></h2>
<p>The possibility of a scary or “bad” trip is very real. There are many things that can influence the DMT experience, including your personal psychology and the setting or environment of the trip. But it’s important to know that not all people see “bad trips” as bad. Many people on the psychedelic path relate to scary or challenging material in their visions as opportunities for letting go or for learning about themselves and their emotional habits. They prefer to talk about these experiences as not bad but challenging experiences that are insightful and essential parts of the psychedelic path (see videos on the&nbsp;<a href="https://courses.kahpi.net/courses/the-ayahuasca-path"><strong>ayahuasca path</strong>&nbsp;</a>for more about this).</p>
<p>This brings us back to the concept of <i>druuuuuuuuugs</i>.</p>
<p>We should be careful with how we use language. The fact is that words are kind of like <i>magical instruments</i>, especially when&nbsp;it comes to something like DMT. Because, what you expect, believe, and think will shape your DMT experience in very powerful ways. If you truly believe DMT is a toxic drug, then you will likely have terrifying visions. The experience is very prone to suggestibility.</p>
