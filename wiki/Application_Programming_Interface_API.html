<h1>Application Programming Interface (API)</h1>
<p>Some damn pipes for conveying data from one source to another.</p>
<p>Or in greater detail from IBM's website, “An&nbsp;application programming interface, or API, enables companies to open up their applications’ data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies. This allows services and products to communicate with each other and leverage each other’s data and functionality through a&nbsp;documented interface. Developers don't need to know how an API is implemented; they simply use the interface to communicate with other products and services.&nbsp;API use&nbsp;has surged over the past decade, to the degree that many of the most popular&nbsp;web applications&nbsp;today would not be possible without APIs.”</p>
