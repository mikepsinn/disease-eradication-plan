## Overview

This site contains the complete economic analysis for the **1% Treaty** and **Decentralized FDA (dFDA)** initiative, designed for foundation economists and funding decision-makers.

## Key Economic Findings

### Return on Investment

- **Conservative ROI**: [463:1](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) (dFDA R&D savings only, 10-year NPV)
- **Complete ROI**: [1,239:1](economics/economics.qmd) (all eight primary benefit categories, 10-year average)

### Cost-Effectiveness

- **Cost per life saved**: Net societal benefit of [$6.56M per life](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)
- **Annual lives saved**: [26,446](appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) (conservative estimate)
- **QALYs generated**: [840,000 annually](appendix/dfda-qaly-model.qmd)

### Financial Structure

- **Annual funding**: $27.2B (1% of global military spending)
- **Peace dividend**: [$113.6B annually](appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) from reduced conflict costs
- **Health savings**: [$50.0B+ annually](appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) from 82x cost reduction in clinical trials
- **VICTORY Bonds returns**: [271.8% annually](economics/victory-bonds.qmd), perpetually

## Methodology

All economic models use:

- **Net Present Value (NPV)** analysis with conservative assumptions
- **Peer-reviewed research** as data sources
- **Sensitivity analysis** for key parameters
- **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY)** for health outcomes
- **Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)** for intervention comparison

## For Foundation Economists

This analysis is designed to support funding decisions by providing:

1. **Transparent calculations** with all assumptions documented
2. **Conservative estimates** using peer-reviewed data sources
3. **Sensitivity analysis** for key parameters
4. **Comparison benchmarks** against other high-ROI interventions
5. **Risk assessment** with mitigation strategies

All models are reproducible and use centralized parameters from [`economic_parameters.py`](economic_parameters.py).
