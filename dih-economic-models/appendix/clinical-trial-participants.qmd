Here's a fun fact: humanity spends [$83 billion a year on clinical trials](../references.qmd#global-clinical-trials-market-2024), but **nobody tracks how many people actually participate**.

Not the WHO. Not the FDA. Not ClinicalTrials.gov. Nobody.

We can tell you how many trials exist (515,000 registered globally). We can tell you how much money gets spent ($83B). But ask "how many humans participated last year?" and you get... silence.

It's like running a restaurant that tracks food costs and table counts but has no idea how many customers showed up.

## So We Built a Script and Did the Math

We pulled 100,000 trials from ClinicalTrials.gov and counted actual enrollment numbers:

### US Trials (Cumulative)

- Phase 1: 722,619 people (median: 33 per trial)
- Phase 2: 2,181,530 people (median: 60 per trial)
- Phase 3: 6,548,474 people (median: 237 per trial)
- Phase 4: 2,718,541 people (median: 90 per trial)
- **Total: 12.2 million people** across all active/recruiting/completed US trials

But that's cumulative - trials running over many years. To get annual enrollment, divide by average trial duration (~2.7 years):

That's the old estimate based on average trial duration. But we can do better.

## The Better Method: Count Completed Trials

We analyzed trials that **actually completed** each year (not estimates):

**US Interventional Trials (Phase 1-4 drug trials only):**

- 2024: 1.66M participants (3,038 completed trials)
- 2023: 1.56M participants (3,557 completed trials)
- 2022: 1.52M participants (3,631 completed trials)
- 2021: 842K participants (3,601 trials)
- 2020: 951K participants (3,366 trials)

**Average US: ~1.5 million/year** (interventional drug trials)

The US represents [54% of the global trials market](../references.qmd#us-clinical-trials-market-2024), so:

**Global: ~2.8 million participants/year** (strict definition - interventional only)

But this excludes observational studies, device trials, and behavioral interventions. If you count everything:

**Global: ~5-8 million participants/year** (all clinical research)

England's data confirms the scale: [1.05 million participants in 2023/24](../references.qmd#england-trial-participants-2023-24) across all study types.

## The Tragedy in Numbers

World population: 8 billion

Clinical trial participants annually (midpoint): 5 million

### Participation rate: 0.06%

Six-hundredths of one percent. If clinical trials were a lottery, your odds would be 1 in 1,600.

Meanwhile, [150,000 people die every day](../references.qmd#daily-death-toll) from diseases we're studying.

## The Access Lottery

But here's the real kicker: [2.4 billion people are living with chronic diseases](../references.qmd#global-burden-disease-chronic-conditions-2013) right now. That's cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, COPD, mental illness, chronic pain.

They're alive. They're suffering. And they could potentially benefit from the treatments we're studying.

**The ratio: 1 person gets access to trials for every 480 living with disease.**

## The Willingness Gap

And here's what makes it even more infuriating: [surveys show 49-51% of people are willing to participate in clinical trials](../references.qmd#patient-willingness-clinical-trials).

**Half of humanity would say yes if asked.**

But only **0.2% actually get to participate.**

That's not a recruitment problem. That's an exclusion problem.

The system isn't failing because people don't want to help find cures. It's failing because:

- Trials only exist at major academic medical centers
- Most people live too far away
- Eligibility criteria exclude 90% of patients
- Enrollment caps fill up instantly

We have 1.2 billion people with chronic disease who are willing and able to participate. We're enrolling 5 million.

**We're turning away 99.6% of willing participants.**

## The Cost Per Patient

$83 billion ÷ 5 million participants = **$16,600 per participant annually**

That's not per treatment. That's the overhead cost per human enrolled, covering:

- Regulatory paperwork
- Compliance monitoring
- Data collection
- Insurance against lawsuits
- Committees reviewing committees
- The salaries of people whose job is writing protocols

Phase 3 trials ([median 237 participants](../references.qmd#clinicaltrials-gov-enrollment-data-2025)) cost [$20 million each](../references.qmd#phase-3-cost-per-trial). That's $84,388 per patient. Not for the drug. For the *trial*.

You could buy each participant a new Honda Civic and still have money left over.

## Why This Matters

If you get cancer, your odds of getting into a clinical trial are about 5%. If you're unlucky enough to get a rare disease, your odds of a trial *existing* are basically zero.

The system isn't designed to help sick people try treatments. It's designed to generate data clean enough to satisfy regulators. The fact that some people get treatment is a side effect.

**Humans spend $83 billion a year to help 0.2% of the 2.4 billion people suffering from chronic disease.**

The other 99.8% get to wait. And suffer. And while they wait, 150,000 die every day.

## The Data We Have

Here's what we pulled from [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/data-api/api):

| Phase | Trials | Total Enrollment | Median/Trial | Cost/Patient |
|-------|--------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Phase 1 | 11,833 | 722,619 | 33 | $15,909 |
| Phase 2 | 14,852 | 2,181,530 | 60 | $9,174 |
| Phase 3 | 8,989 | 6,548,474 | 237 | $5,650 |
| Phase 4 | 5,790 | 2,718,541 | 90 | $6,437 |

(Cost per patient calculated from [phase spending estimates](global-clinical-trial-spending-by-phase.qmd) divided by participant counts)

**The absurd part:** These are the *best* numbers available, and they're educated guesses based on trial durations we estimated from other research.

## What the 1% Treaty Could Do

The math is straightforward:

### Today's Capacity

- [Global military spending: $2.7 trillion](../references.qmd#global-military-spending)
- Clinical trials spending: $83 billion
- Participants: 5 million/year at $16,600 each

#### With 1% of Military Spending Redirected

- 1% of $2.7T = **$27 billion additional**
- New total: **$110 billion** (32% increase in funding)

#### With Decentralized FDA

- Enrollment isn't limited by proximity to trial sites
- Patients report outcomes via smartphone
- Trials run continuously instead of in isolated batches
- Cost per participant drops to **~$1,000** (from $16,600)

#### The Result

- $110B ÷ $1,000 = **110 million participants/year**
- Current: 5 million/year
- **Medical progress accelerates 22x**

A cure that would take 22 years could take 1 year.

And we'd only be using **9% of available capacity** (1.2 billion willing participants).

The data would be better too. More diverse. More representative. Collected from people living their actual lives instead of visiting clinics every week.

## The Bottom Line

Nobody knows how many people participate in clinical trials because nobody bothers to track it.

We had to build a script to count.

The answer: **5 million people a year, at a cost of $16,600 each.**

**2.4 billion people are living with chronic disease.**

### The ratio: 1 in 480.

The 99.8% who don't get access? They suffer. And 150,000 die every day.
