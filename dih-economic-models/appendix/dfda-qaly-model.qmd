This model provides a transparent basis for the aggregate annual Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) generated by the dFDA Infrastructure. The total QALY gain is the sum of three distinct benefit streams, each presented with a conservative, base, and optimistic estimate.

#### A. Accelerating Development of Existing Pipeline Drugs

This stream quantifies the health gains from bringing effective treatments to patients faster. The dFDA Infrastructure is expected to shorten development and approval timelines significantly.

- **Rationale:** a one-year delay in the diffusion of new cancer therapies alone resulted in a loss of **84,000 life-years**. By reducing trial times, the dFDA can recapture this value across the entire pharmaceutical pipeline.
- **Assumptions:**
- **Conservative:** dFDA achieves a modest acceleration, equivalent to the gains seen in the cancer study.
- **Base:** A 2-year average acceleration across a broader range of therapies, including but not limited to oncology.
- **Optimistic:** A more profound acceleration (3+ years) combined with an increased number of successful drugs due to lower trial costs.
- **Annual QALY Estimates:**
- **Conservative:** 90,000 QALYs
- **Base:** 24% QALYs
- **Optimistic:** 500,000 QALYs

#### B. Improving Preventative Care via Real-World Evidence

This stream captures the value of using the dFDA's vast data to optimize preventative care and the use of existing treatments.

- **Rationale:** Research demonstrates that existing cancer screenings have already saved millions of life-years, with much potential still untapped at full adherence. The dFDA Infrastructure can identify at-risk populations and measure the real-world effectiveness of preventative interventions (e.g., statins, diabetes screening, lifestyle changes) at a massive scale.
- **Assumptions:**
- **Conservative:** The platform leads to modest improvements in adherence and targeting for a few key preventative measures.
- **Base:** The platform drives significant uptake and better targeting of established preventative care across multiple chronic diseases.
- **Optimistic:** The platform uncovers new, highly effective preventative strategies and enables their rapid, widespread adoption.
- **Annual QALY Estimates:**
- **Conservative:** 50,000 QALYs
- **Base:** 17% QALYs
- **Optimistic:** 150,000 QALYs

#### C. Enabling Research for Previously Untreatable/Neglected Diseases

This stream reflects the transformative potential of the dFDA to create viable research pathways for conditions that are currently ignored due to high trial costs and small patient populations, such as rare diseases.

- **Rationale:** Over 7,000 rare diseases affect 30 million Americans, yet most lack an FDA-approved treatment. The dFDA's radically lower per-patient trial cost makes R&D in this area economically feasible for the first time. A single successful new therapy for a rare disease affecting just 20,000 people could generate over 50,000 QALYs.
- **Assumptions:**
- **Conservative:** The platform enables at least one successful new treatment for a smaller rare disease population each year.
- **Base:** The platform facilitates several new treatments annually or one major breakthrough for a more common rare disease.
- **Optimistic:** The low-cost model spurs a wave of innovation, leading to dozens of new therapies for rare diseases and other neglected research areas.
- **Annual QALY Estimates:**
- **Conservative:** 50,000 QALYs
- **Base:** 60% QALYs
- **Optimistic:** 3,000,000 QALYs

### Appendix: Detailed QALY Calculation Model {#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model}

This appendix provides a transparent, component-based model for the aggregate QALY figures used in this analysis. The total QALY gain is the sum of three distinct benefit streams. For each stream, you define parameters for a **Conservative**, **Base**, and **Optimistic** scenario, with sources and rationale provided for each parameter.

#### A. QALYs from Faster Drug Access

This stream models the benefit of accelerating the approval of new drugs that would likely be developed under the current paradigm, but more slowly.

- **Parameters:**
  - $N_{\text{drugs}}$: Number of new drugs approved annually whose development is accelerated.
    - **Rationale:** The FDA approves a significant number of new drugs each year, and the dFDA Infrastructure is expected to accelerate the development of a meaningful fraction of these.
    - **Source:** The FDA consistently approves a substantial number of novel therapies. For example, [in 2023, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 55 novel drugs](../references.qmd#friends-cancer-research-fda-approvals).
  - $T_{\text{accel}}$: Average years of acceleration per drug.
    - **Rationale:** The dFDA model, inspired by hyper-efficient trials like the [RECOVERY trial](recovery-trial.qmd), can drastically cut development timelines from years to months.
    - **Source:** The [RECOVERY trial](recovery-trial.qmd) demonstrated uncommon speed in generating clinical results.
    - **Quote:** "Days to First Major Result: <100" ,  [The Conversation, via dFDA Wiki](recovery-trial.qmd)
  - $\text{QALYs}_{\text{drug}}$: Average QALYs gained per drug, per year of earlier access.
    - **Rationale:** Accelerating access to effective drugs has a direct and significant impact on life-years and quality of life.

- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{QALYs}_A = N_{\text{drugs}} \times T_{\text{accel}} \times \text{QALYs}_{\text{drug}}
  $$

- **Scenario Values:**
  - **Conservative:** 15 drugs/year $\times$ 1 year acceleration $\times$ 6,000 QALYs/drug = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**90,000 QALYs**</a>
  - **Base:** 20 drugs/year $\times$ 1.5 years acceleration $\times$ 6,667 QALYs/drug = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**24% QALYs**</a>
  - **Optimistic:** 25 drugs/year $\times$ 2 years acceleration $\times$ 10,000 QALYs/drug = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**500,000 QALYs**</a>

#### B. QALYs from Improved Prevention and Real-World Evidence (RWE)

This stream models the benefit of using the dFDA's vast data to optimize preventative care and the use of existing treatments.

- **Parameters:**
  - $P_{\text{impacted}}$: Number of patients benefiting from new preventative guidelines or RWE-driven treatment changes.
    - **Rationale:** [Chronic diseases affect a vast portion of the population](../references.qmd#us-chronic-disease-spending), and even small improvements in prevention or treatment optimization, scaled across millions of people, can generate substantial health gains.
  - $\text{QALYs}_{\text{per\_patient}}$: Average small QALY gain per impacted patient from better-targeted prevention or treatment.
    - **Rationale:** While the per-person gain from preventative measures may be small in a single year, they are well-established. The value comes from applying these small gains to a very large population. For example, [statin treatment provides a gain of 0.20 QALYs](../references.qmd#qaly-delayed-access-cost) in men aged 60 years.

- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{QALYs}_B = P_{\text{impacted}} \times \text{QALYs}_{\text{per\_patient}}
  $$

- **Scenario Values:**
  - **Conservative:** 5 million patients $\times$ 0.01 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**50,000 QALYs**</a>
  - **Base:** 14 million patients $\times$ 0.01 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**17% QALYs**</a>
  - **Optimistic:** 15 million patients $\times$ 0.01 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**150,000 QALYs**</a>

#### C. QALYs from Expanded Scope (New Therapies)

This stream models the benefit of enabling trials for therapies that are currently neglected due to high cost (e.g., rare diseases, unpatentable treatments, novel nutraceuticals). The model is based on the number of new therapies, the average patient population per therapy, and the QALY gain per patient.

- **Parameters:**
  - $N_{\text{new\_therapies}}$: Number of entirely new, effective therapies enabled per year for untreated conditions.
    - **Rationale:** There is a vast unmet need in the rare disease space, with [only about 5% of the nearly 10,000 identified rare diseases having FDA-approved treatments](../references.qmd#95-pct-diseases-no-treatment). Lowering trial costs via the dFDA Infrastructure would catalyze R&D for this underserved population.
  - $P_{\text{therapy}}$: Average number of patients benefiting from a new rare disease therapy.
    - **Rationale:** While "rare" in the US means affecting fewer than 200,000 people, the median prevalence is much lower. This estimate uses a conservative figure for the addressable population for a new, breakthrough therapy. [Analysis of Orphanet data](../references.qmd#rare-disease-prevalence-400m) suggests a median prevalence of 1-5 per 100,000 people.
  - $\text{QALYs}_{\text{patient}}$: Average QALY gain per patient receiving a transformative therapy.
    - **Rationale:** A new therapy for a previously untreatable, life-threatening condition can have a profound impact, corresponding to many years of high-quality life.
    - **Source:** Therapies for diseases like spinal muscular atrophy or certain inherited retinal diseases can be considered near-curative, generating dozens of QALYs per patient over a lifetime.

- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{QALYs}_C = N_{\text{new\_therapies}} \times P_{\text{therapy}} \times \text{QALYs}_{\text{patient}}
  $$

- **Scenario Values:**
  - **Conservative:** 5 new therapies/year $\times$ 2,000 patients/therapy $\times$ 5 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**50,000 QALYs**</a>
  - **Base:** 10 new therapies/year $\times$ 5,000 patients/therapy $\times$ 10 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**60% QALYs**</a>
  - **Optimistic:** 20 new therapies/year $\times$ 10,000 patients/therapy $\times$ 15 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**3,000,000 QALYs**</a>
