The dFDA Infrastructure costs **$40M per year** to run.
It saves the world **$50.0B per year** in clinical trial costs.
That's a **463:1 return on investment**.

Here's how.

## The Math: From $41,000 to $500 Per Patient

Traditional Phase III trials cost **$40,000-120,000 per patient**. That's more than a Tesla per person to find out if a pill works. The pill costs 37 cents to make. The paperwork weighs more than the patient.

The Oxford RECOVERY trial proved humans can do the same thing for **$500 per patient**. They tested COVID treatments on 40,000+ patients by:

- Using existing hospital staff (revolutionary concept: doctors treating patients)
- Collecting data electronically (instead of sacrificing forests to the paperwork gods)
- Focusing on what actually matters: does the patient live or die? (not "did they complete form 27-B in triplicate?")

The dFDA takes this model global. **80-160x cost reduction**. Same quality data. Better real-world applicability. Turns out you don't need 17 committees to ask "did the medicine work?"

## Where the $50 Billion Comes From

Global clinical trial spending: **$100.0B per year** (and growing).

Conservative estimate: dFDA captures 50% efficiency gains across the market.

- 50% of $100B = **$50B saved annually**

Optimistic scenarios show up to 95% cost reduction (like RECOVERY achieved), potentially saving **$95B annually**.

## What $50 Billion Buys You

With the money saved every year, humans could:

- Fund **10,000 new trials** (at $5M each using efficient methods)
- Test treatments for **7,000 rare diseases** currently ignored (because orphan diseases aren't profitable enough for your orphan-making economic system)
- Cut drug development time from 17 years to 3-5 years (most terminal patients don't have 17 years, which seems like a design flaw)
- Make medicines affordable by eliminating $2.2B development costs (the $2.2B is mostly lawyers arguing about commas)

## Daily Opportunity Cost

Every day we don't implement this represents a massive societal cost: **$137 million** in wasted trial inefficiency and **2,301 QALYs** lost to delayed treatments.

**For detailed calculations and sensitivity analysis**, see [Daily Opportunity Cost of Inaction](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#daily-opportunity-cost-of-inaction).

## The Platform Cost Breakdown

The dFDA costs approximately **$40M annually** to operate at scale, with a similar one-time build cost. This includes cloud infrastructure, a lean engineering team, compliance, and global integration.

**For detailed cost analysis including ROM estimates, market comparables, and sensitivity scenarios**, see [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd).

## ROI Scenarios

The 463:1 ROI is the central estimate based on NPV analysis over 10 years. Even in worst-case scenarios (higher costs, lower adoption), the ROI remains exceptional at 66:1.

**For interactive charts, sensitivity analysis, and detailed NPV calculations**, see [Interactive Financial Modeling & Computational Analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#interactive-financial-modeling--computational-analysis).

## Why This Isn't Happening Already

Simple: The people getting rich from the current system aren't the ones paying for it.

- **CROs** make billions from inefficiency
- **Regulators** protect their bureaucratic empires
- **Pharma** passes costs to patients anyway
- **Patients** have no power to change the system they're dying in

Until now. The dFDA changes the game by aligning incentives: everyone profits from efficiency.

## The ROI

$40M to save $50 billion.
463:1 ROI.
80x cost reduction per patient.
10,000x more trials possible.

This isn't a moonshot. The RECOVERY trial already proved it works. The only thing left to do is scale it globally. But humans are still debating whether saving $50 billion is worth $40 million, which is like debating whether picking up a hundred-dollar bill is worth bending over.

Every day you wait costs $137 million and 2,301 lives. But at least the paperwork is properly filed.
