Two timelines diverge from this moment. Same planet, same technology, opposite destinies. The only variable is a 1% budget reallocation.

## Path A: Idiocracy

You continue on your current path. The smartest minds are drawn to the ever-growing dark economy of cybercrime and AI-driven conflict. The singularity happens, but it's an inverse one, a hockey stick pointing straight down. Global systems collapse, antibiotics fail, and the average lifespan plummets. Warlords with AI armies fight over the scraps in a radioactive wasteland. Earth's final epitaph: "They had magic but chose madness."

## Path B: Wishonia

You pass a 1% treaty. The brightest minds and most powerful technologies are redirected from destruction to creation. The feedback loop is immediate: more funding leads to more cures, which leads to more public support for more funding. By 2040, aging is reversible, suffering is optional, and scarcity is a memory. By 2050, you have cured death, solved physics, and are planning your expansion into the galaxy.

## The Only Variable

Same species.
Same year.
Same technology.
The only difference: One 1% budget reallocation.

## The Two Paths

- [Chapter 21: Path A - Moronia](futures/moronia.qmd) - How we become Gollum (extinction by 2050)
- [Chapter 22: Path B - Wishonia](futures/wishonia.qmd) - How we become genies (immortality by 2045)
