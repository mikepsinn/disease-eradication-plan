title: Your Personal Benefits
description: What You Actually Get From This
---

Forget saving humanity. Let's talk about what you, personally, get out of this. You don't need to be a good person to support this plan. You just need to be selfish.

## Your Actual Odds Right Now

If you get sick (and you will), your chances of getting into a clinical trial are **0.2%** - that's 1 in 480 people with chronic disease.

[Half of humanity is willing to participate](../references.qmd#patient-willingness-clinical-trials), but the system can only handle [5 million people per year](../appendix/clinical-trial-participants.qmd). The other 99.8% get to die while waiting for approval.

## What You Actually Get

**If you're sick, or will ever get sick:**

Instead of waiting 17 years for a cure that may never come, you get immediate access to subsidized clinical trials for every disease. Your chance of survival goes from near-zero to "actually possible."

## If you're healthy (for now)

As diseases are cured, healthcare costs plummet. A 1% treaty expands clinical trial capacity by {{< var trial_capacity_multiplier >}}× ({{< var trial_capacity_cumulative_years_20yr >}} trial-capacity-equivalent years in 20 years). That means cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's - all tackled simultaneously by gene therapy, AI drug discovery, stem cells, and epigenetics.

### If you have money

[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) offer a projected **{{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual return**, perpetually. I could not find a comparable investment. You can profit while funding the research that will make you immortal.

#### If you have a family

Your parents won't die of Alzheimer's. Your children won't have to worry about rare diseases. You get to keep the people you love.

### The Math

Here's what a typical 30-year-old making $50,000/year gets with 20 years of life extension (median estimate):

{{< include ../figures/personal-lifetime-wealth-component-breakdown-pie-chart.qmd >}}


Where does this come from?

- **Extended Earnings**: You live extra years beyond age 80. That's more years of earning, investing, and compounding.
- **GDP Boost (Mil→Research)**: Redirecting military spending to research creates GDP growth (post-WW2: 30% military cut → 8% GDP growth). This compounds over your extended lifetime.
- **Healthcare Savings**: Diseases get cured, your insurance premiums drop.
- **Productivity Gains**: You're healthier, you work better, you earn more.

### Uncertainty Analysis

Life extension could range from 5 years (conservative, antibiotic precedent) to 50+ years (optimistic, aging reversal). The Monte Carlo analysis shows the full range:

{{< include ../figures/mc-distribution-personal_lifetime_wealth.qmd >}}

{{< include ../figures/tornado-personal_lifetime_wealth.qmd >}}

### The Bottom Line

With a median 20-year life extension estimate:

- **If you're 30:** ~$1-2M total benefit (range depends on actual life extension achieved)
- **If you're 25:** Even higher due to more compounding years
- **If you're 55:** Lower but still substantial

With optimistic 50+ year life extension (aging reversal scenarios), benefits multiply several times.

This isn't a charity. It's a deal. You're being offered substantial lifetime wealth, extra years of life, and the survival of your loved ones in exchange for supporting a 1% budget reallocation.

It's the best deal anyone has ever offered you.

### What You're Actually Making Per Hour

You're not being asked to donate your time. You're being offered the highest-paying job in human history.

#### Time Investment

- Reading this book: 14.3 hours (171,121 words at 200 words/minute)
- Taking actions: 0.5 hours ([Vote 2 min + Invest 10 min + Recruit 15 min](three-actions.qmd))
- **Total: 14.8 hours**

**Effective Hourly Rate: $291k/hour**

This is:

- **9,700x** the average US wage (~$30/hour)
- **29x** a CEO's hourly rate (~$10,000/hour)

The catch? You only get paid if the plan works. But if it does, you just made $291k/hour for 14.8 hours of work.

**Your choice. But choose fast.** While you were reading this, another person just died.
