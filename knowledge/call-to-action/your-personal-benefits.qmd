description: What You Actually Get From This
---

Forget saving humanity. Let's talk about what you, personally, get out of this. You don't need to be a good person to support this plan. You just need to be selfish.

## Your Actual Odds Right Now

If you get sick (and you will), your chances of getting into a clinical trial are **0.2%** - that's 1 in 480 people with chronic disease.

[Half of humanity is willing to participate](../references.qmd#patient-willingness-clinical-trials), but the system can only handle [5 million people per year](../appendix/clinical-trial-participants.qmd). The other 99.8% get to die while waiting for approval.

## What You Actually Get

**If you're sick, or will ever get sick:**

Instead of waiting 17 years for a cure that may never come, you get immediate access to subsidized clinical trials for every disease. Your chance of survival goes from near-zero to "actually possible."

## If you're healthy (for now)

As diseases are cured, healthcare costs plummet. A 1% treaty expands clinical trial capacity by {{< var trial_capacity_multiplier >}}× ({{< var trial_capacity_cumulative_years_20yr >}} trial-capacity-equivalent years in 20 years). That means cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's - all tackled simultaneously by gene therapy, AI drug discovery, stem cells, and epigenetics.

### If you have money

[VICTORY Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) offer a projected **{{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual return**, perpetually. I could not find a comparable investment. You can profit while funding the research that will make you immortal.

#### If you have a family

Your parents won't die of Alzheimer's. Your children won't have to worry about rare diseases. You get to keep the people you love.

### The Math

Here's what a typical 30-year-old making $50,000/year actually gets:

{{< include ../figures/disease-eradication-lifetime-wealth-component-breakdown-pie-chart.qmd >}}


Where does this come from?

- **Extended Earnings** (30%): You live 72 extra years (age 80→152). That's 72 more years of earning, investing, and compounding.
- **Economic Multiplier** (58%): Redirecting military spending to research creates GDP growth (post-WW2: 30% military cut → 8% GDP growth). This compounds over your 122-year lifetime.
- **Healthcare Savings** (4%): Diseases get cured, your insurance premiums drop by ~$1,650/year.
- **Productivity Gains** (8%): You're healthier, you work better, you earn more.

{{< include ../figures/disease-eradication-annual-benefits-stacked-area-chart.qmd >}}

**The red line at age 80 is everything.** Without the treaty, you're dead. With the treaty, you live another 72 years. Everything to the right of that line - roughly **60-70% of your total lifetime wealth** - only exists if this succeeds.

### Your Wealth Depends on Treaty Terms

{{< include ../figures/disease-eradication-lifetime-wealth-by-treaty-percentage-line-chart.qmd >}}

The treaty percentage negotiated determines whether you get millions or generational wealth:

- **0.5% Treaty**: $3.6M lifetime benefit
- **1% treaty** (DEFAULT): $4.3M lifetime benefit
- **5% Treaty**: $16M lifetime benefit

This is why the treaty terms matter. The difference between 1% and 5% is measured in tens of millions per person.

### The Bottom Line

- **If you're 30:** Life expectancy jumps from 80 to 152 (+72 years), $4.3M total benefit
- **If you're 25:** Life expectancy to 157 (+77 years), $5.0M total benefit
- **If you're 55:** Life expectancy to 147 (+67 years), $2.8M total benefit

This isn't a charity. It's a deal. You're being offered millions in lifetime wealth, 70+ extra years of life, and the survival of your loved ones in exchange for supporting a 1% budget reallocation.

It's the best deal anyone has ever offered you.

### What You're Actually Making Per Hour

You're not being asked to donate your time. You're being offered the highest-paying job in human history.

#### Time Investment

- Reading this book: 14.3 hours (171,121 words at 200 words/minute)
- Taking actions: 0.5 hours ([Vote 2 min + Invest 10 min + Recruit 15 min](three-actions.qmd))
- **Total: 14.8 hours**

**Effective Hourly Rate: $291k/hour**

This is:

- **9,700x** the average US wage (~$30/hour)
- **29x** a CEO's hourly rate (~$10,000/hour)

The catch? You only get paid if the plan works. But if it does, you just made $291k/hour for 14.8 hours of work.

**Your choice. But choose fast.** While you were reading this, another person just died.
