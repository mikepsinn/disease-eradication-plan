**The Highest-ROI Public Health Intervention Ever Proposed**

**Shift 1% of global military spending into decentralized clinical trials.

Accelerate medical progress 115×.
Save trillions annually.
Prevent millions of deaths.
Strengthen national security.
And finance it using self-interest.**

Humanity spends **$2.2 trillion per year** developing better ways to damage itself, and **$48 billion per year** developing better ways to heal itself.

This is a **46× misallocation** of resources relative to our actual goals:
less disease, more life, more prosperity, fewer funerals.

The solution is mathematically straightforward:

> **Move 1% of the “making corpses” budget into the “preventing corpses” budget.**
> No new taxes.
> No cuts to social programs.
> No trade-offs.
> Just 1% less global self-harm.

# **The Result**

### **463:1 to 1,239:1 ROI**

### **115× faster medical progress**

### **The equivalent of 2,000 years of medical advancement in 20 years**

### **9.1 trillion hours of unnecessary human suffering eliminated annually**

### **20–60 million life-years saved per billion dollars invested**

### **Money saved: $114B + $50–100B per year**

These figures are conservative and based on real-world results:

* **Oxford RECOVERY** showed trials can be **82× cheaper** when stripped to scientific essentials.
* This method produced **the most important COVID discoveries**—faster than any bureaucracy in history.
* The limiting factor is not scientific knowledge.
* The limiting factor is **administrative friction**.

Right now, medical progress flows through a soda straw.
A 1% shift makes it a **fire hose**.

---

# **Why 1% Is Enough**

### **1. The Peace Dividend: $114B/year saved**

Even a 1% reduction in global weapons procurement yields massive savings.
Bombs are expensive, and breaking things is not free to repair.

### **2. The Research Efficiency Dividend: $50B–$100B/year saved**

Pragmatic trials eliminate:

* bespoke infrastructure
* redundant data collection
* high-cost monitoring
* regulatory overproduction
* 17 years of unnecessary documentation

This is why costs fall **82×**, not 2× or 5×.

### **3. 15–40 “NIH equivalents” of new research capacity**

For the first time, humanity would fund medical progress **faster than disease progression**, reversing a century-long imbalance.

---

# **And It Strengthens National Security**

A 1% coordinated shift **does not change**:

* relative power balances
* deterrence
* force ratios
* strategic stability
* readiness
* cyber capabilities
* troop projection
* nuclear deterrence posture

But it **does** reduce existential risk:

* fewer deployed warheads
* lower accidental-launch probability
* reduced crisis instability
* fewer escalatory supply-chain pressures

A safer world with the same level of deterrence is strictly better.

This is one of the only reforms that is **pro-security and pro-survival** simultaneously.

---

# **Why This Works: The Political Economy (The Real Bottleneck)**

Good ideas don’t win by being good.
Good ideas win by **aligning incentives**.

Here is the alignment engine:

---

# **Victory Social Impact Bonds: The Greed-Aligned Engine That Makes This Pass**

The plan succeeds because **investors profit** from the cost savings generated by the 1% shift.

### **This is how it works:**

1. Investors buy **Victory Social Impact Bonds**.
2. Funds are used to run the **most effective lobbying campaign in modern history**, aimed at redirecting 1% of global military spending into medical research.
3. When the reform passes, governments save **hundreds of billions** (peace dividend + research-efficiency dividend).
4. A portion of these savings repays investors with strong returns.
5. Investors, therefore, fund the campaign that causes their own returns.

This is **public choice theory applied correctly**:
Self-interest becomes a public good.

No one has to become a better person for this to work.
They just have to follow incentives.


## **The Complete, Causal Roadmap (How It Actually Passes)**

This is not utopian. It is a mechanical sequence:

### **Step 1 — Global Survey on Human Values**

Demonstrate overwhelming global public support for medical acceleration and reduced suffering.
This creates legitimacy and media momentum.

### **Step 2 — Hit the 3.5% Tipping Point**

Social-movement science shows that **3.5% committed support** reliably precedes policy adoption.
This is the activation threshold.

### **Step 3 — Assemble the Investor Coalition**

Victory Bond investors fund the lobbying campaign because the reform pays for itself many times over.

### **Step 4 — Execute the Most Cost-Effective Lobbying Campaign Possible**

Lobbyists and political strategists deploy Victory Bond funds to pass 1% military reallocation legislation.
This is standard political action—just pointed at saving lives instead of making weapons.

### **Step 5 — Deploy Funds Through the Decentralized FDA (dFDA)**

The 1% shift becomes **infinitely scalable, automated pragmatic trials**.
Thousands of long-tail treatments finally get tested.
Effective ones instantly scale.

### **Step 6 — Civilization Enters the Medical Singularity Phase**

115× acceleration.
Disease categories collapse.
Healthspan overtakes pathology.
Investors profit.
Governments save money.
The world becomes healthier, safer, and richer.
Everyone wins.

A plan is credible not because it is idealistic, but because **every step is economically rational for every participating actor**.

---

# **Why This Is the Dominant Strategy for Civilization**

If your goal is to maximize:

* QALYs
* DALYs averted
* lifespan
* productivity
* economic growth
* national security
* existential safety
* reduction in human suffering

…then this is not merely a good policy.
It is the **mathematically dominant strategy**.

A $1B investment yields:

* more health
* more survival
* more stability
* more prosperity
* more innovation
* more safety

than any other use of $1B known in public policy, philanthropy, global health, or defense.

No bed net.
No vaccine.
No research initiative.
No climate intervention.
No economic reform.
No AI safety lab.
No global treaty.

All are valuable.
None offer **115× leverage**.


## Executive Summary

Here's how you get {{< var roi_dfda_savings_only >}} to {{< var dfda_roi_simple >}} returns on redirecting {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of murder money ([{{< var global_annual_human_cost_state_violence >}}/year](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)) to not-murder money.

The beautiful part: it costs zero new dollars. You're just moving money from the "making corpses" column to the "preventing corpses" column in the budget spreadsheet.

You get paid twice for the same {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} shift:

1. **Peace dividend**: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/year appears when you build 1% fewer bombs (turns out bombs are expensive and breaking things costs money to fix)
2. **Research efficiency**: {{< var dfda_gross_savings_annual >}}+/year saved by not drowning scientists in paperwork (Oxford proved trials cost [82x less](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) when you stop requiring 17 years of documentation)

### The Numbers

- **Conservative returns**: [{{< var roi_dfda_savings_only >}}](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) (counting only R&D savings, ignoring everything else)
- **Realistic returns**: {{< var roi_all_direct_benefits >}}:1 (counting all eight measurable benefits)
- **Per life saved**: Society MAKES [$6.56M](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) (vs. best charities SPENDING [{{< var givewell_cost_per_life_min >}}-{{< var givewell_cost_per_life_max >}}](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved))
- **Lives saved yearly**: {{< var treaty_total_lives_saved_annual >}} (lowball estimate)

## How the Math Works

### The Approach

Standard economic analysis, nothing fancy:

- Discount future money at {{< var dfda_trial_abandonment_rate >}} (economists insist on this)
- Count quality-adjusted life years (economist-speak for "being alive and not miserable")
- Compare cost per outcome to other interventions
- Test what happens if we're wrong about everything (see [sensitivity analysis](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd))

The calculations are conservative and validated against the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd), which proved {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} cost reduction by not requiring 40,000 pages of paperwork per patient.

### Two Ways to Count

**{{< var roi_dfda_savings_only >}} = Pessimistic (R&D Savings Only)**

Count only the {{< var current_drug_approvals_per_year >}}/year saved from {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} cheaper trials. Pretend everything else doesn't exist. This is the floor. This is what you tell skeptical accountants.

**{{< var roi_all_direct_benefits >}}:1 = Realistic (All Eight Benefits)**

Count all {{< var total_complete_benefits_annual >}}/year in measurable benefits: peace dividend, R&D savings, earlier access, research acceleration, rare disease treatments, drug price reductions, prevention, and mental health. This is what actually happens.

### Which Number to Use

**Use {{< var roi_dfda_savings_only >}}** when talking to:
- Risk-averse investors who trust nothing
- Regulators paid to say "no"
- People who think optimism is a character flaw

**Use {{< var roi_all_direct_benefits >}}:1** when talking to:
- Anyone who can count to eight
- Foundation grant reviewers
- People interested in reality

Both use the same math. One just counts more stuff.

## The Conservative Case: {{< var roi_dfda_savings_only >}} ROI (dFDA Only)

Here's the floor. Count only R&D savings from cheaper trials. Ignore peace dividends, earlier access, and everything else that makes this look "too good to be true."

### The Math

Basic division:

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Benefits}}{\text{Costs}} = \frac{\$249.3\text{B}}{\$538\text{M}} = 463:1
$$

where [$249.3B](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) is what you save over 10 years and {{< var dfda_npv_total_cost >}} is what you spend to build it.

This uses "net present value" which is economist code for "future money is worth less than current money" ({{< var dfda_trial_abandonment_rate >}} discount rate, 10-year horizon). For the spreadsheet addicts: [full NPV methodology here](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#calculation-framework---npv-methodology).

### Where the Money Comes From

{{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military budgets gets redirected. This gives you:

- **Funding**: [{{< var global_annual_human_cost_state_violence >}}/year](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) to spend on not-dying
- **Bonus savings**: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/year in economic value from building 1% fewer things that explode

The peace dividend math is simple: wars cost [{{< var global_annual_war_total_cost >}}/year](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd). {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} less war costs {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} less money.

$$
\$11{,}355\text{B} \times 1\% = \$113.6\text{B}
$$

| Cost Category | Annual Amount | Components |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **Direct Military Spending** | [$2,718B](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending) | SIPRI 2024 global military budgets |
| **[Infrastructure Destruction](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | [$1,875B](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) | Transportation, energy, communications, water, education, healthcare facilities |
| **Human Life Losses** | [$2,446B](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) | {{< var global_annual_conflict_deaths_total >}} conflict deaths × {{< var value_of_statistical_life >}} value of statistical life (conservative vs. DOT $13.7M) |
| **[Trade Disruption](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var global_annual_trade_disruption_conflict >}} | Shipping, supply chains, energy prices, currency volatility |
| **[Lost Economic Growth](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | [$2,718B](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) | Opportunity cost of military spending vs. productive investment |
| **[Veteran Healthcare](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var sensitivity_peace_dividend_optimistic >}} | Long-term medical care for conflict-related injuries |
| **Refugee Support** | {{< var global_annual_refugee_support_costs >}} | [108.4M displaced persons](../references.qmd#unhcr-forcibly-displaced-2023) × $1,384/year |
| **[Environmental Damage](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var global_clinical_trial_market_annual >}} | Environmental destruction, toxic contamination, restoration costs |
| **[Psychological Impact](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var global_annual_psychological_impact_costs_conflict >}} | PTSD treatment, mental health services, productivity loss |
| **[Lost Human Capital](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var global_annual_lost_human_capital_conflict >}} | Productive capacity lost from casualties and displacement |
| **Total War Costs** | **$11,355B** | Combined direct and indirect annual costs |
| **1% Reduction** | **{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}** | Peace dividend from 1% treaty implementation |

This calculation methodology follows standard cost-of-conflict analysis frameworks used by the World Bank, IMF, and academic conflict economics research. See [Peace Dividend Calculations](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) for detailed sources and methodology.

### What It Costs to Build

**Total**: {{< var dfda_npv_total_cost >}} over 10 years (present value)
  - Upfront: {{< var dfda_npv_upfront_cost_total >}} (build the platform)
  - Yearly operations: {{< var dfda_upfront_build >}} (keep it running)

The [$27.2B/year](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) peace dividend covers {{< var dfda_upfront_build >}}/year operations **680 times over**. It's like having $680 to pay a $1 bill.

This assumes gradual rollout (0% to {{< var peace_dividend_environmental >}} over 5 years) and middle-range costs. For the detailed breakdown see [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#costs-of-building-and-operating-the-global-decentralized-fda-rom-estimate).

### What You Get Back

- **Money**: [{{< var global_annual_trade_disruption_shipping_conflict >}}](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) in R&D savings (10 years, present value)
- **Returns**: [$249.3B](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) ÷ {{< var dfda_npv_total_cost >}} = **[463:1](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)**
- **People not dying**: {{< var global_dfda_qalys_gained_annual >}} quality-adjusted life years annually

**Two income streams from one budget shift**:

1. **Peace dividend**: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/year saved by not breaking as much stuff
2. **Research efficiency**: [{{< var current_drug_approvals_per_year >}}/year](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) saved by not requiring PhDs to fill out forms for 17 years

**Combined**: {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}}/year (conservative, ignoring most benefits)

**If everything goes wrong**: Worst-case scenario (benefits half as good, costs twice as high) still delivers [189:1 to {{< var optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) returns. See [sensitivity analysis](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd).

### Cost-Effectiveness: Dominant Health Intervention

Unlike traditional public health interventions that require ongoing funding, the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty represents a **dominant intervention**, simultaneously reducing costs while improving health outcomes. This places it in a unique category alongside smallpox eradication and other transformative health achievements.

#### Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)

The ICER measures cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained:

$$
\text{ICER} = \frac{\Delta \text{Cost}}{\Delta \text{QALYs}} = \frac{C_{\text{intervention}} - C_{\text{baseline}}}{Q_{\text{intervention}} - Q_{\text{baseline}}}
$$

For the dFDA Infrastructure (using annual figures):

$$
\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Net Incremental Cost (Annual)}}{\text{QALYs Gained (Annual)}} = \frac{-\$49.96\text{B}}{840{,}000 \text{ QALYs}} = -\$59{,}476 \text{ per QALY}
$$

where the net incremental cost is calculated as platform operational costs ({{< var dfda_upfront_build >}}/year) minus R&D savings ([$50.0B/year](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)) = -$49.96B annually, and {{< var global_dfda_qalys_gained_annual >}} QALYs represents annual quality-adjusted life years gained.

The negative ICER indicates **cost savings while improving health**, a dominant intervention by health economics standards. Standard [willingness-to-pay thresholds are {{< var qalys_from_prevention_conservative >}}-{{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}} per QALY](../references.qmd#icer-qaly-methodology); interventions that save costs while gaining QALYs are unconditionally recommended.

**For comprehensive ICER analysis including sensitivity analysis across multiple scenarios, alternative funding perspectives, and detailed methodology**, see [dFDA ICER Analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#dfda-icer-analysis---cost-utility-framework).

#### Comparative Cost per Life Saved

- **[Against Malaria Foundation](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)**: {{< var givewell_cost_per_life_min >}} cost per life saved (GiveWell top charity)
- **[Deworm the World Initiative](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)**: {{< var givewell_cost_per_life_max >}} cost per life saved (highly cost-effective intervention)
- **{{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty/dFDA System**: [$6,560,000 net societal benefit](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) per life saved (dominant intervention)

The negative cost (net benefit) per life saved distinguishes this as a dominant intervention in health economics terminology, an intervention that both reduces costs and improves outcomes, with no trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness.

### This ROI in Historical Context

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves **{{< var roi_dfda_savings_only >}} return on investment**.

This exceptional ROI comes from:

- **{{< var current_drug_approvals_per_year >}} in annual R&D cost savings**: [{{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} reduction](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) in clinical trial costs
- **Faster access to new treatments**: [2 years instead of 17 years](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) to market
- **Better prevention through real-world data**: Continuous learning from millions of patients
- **Enabling new therapies**: Making [rare disease trials](../references.qmd#rare-disease-patients-300m-globally) economically viable

{{< include ../figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

Comparison to historical public health achievements (ROI ratios):

| Intervention | ROI | Source |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **1% Treaty/dFDA** | **{{< var roi_dfda_savings_only >}}:1** | This analysis |
| [Smallpox eradication](../references.qmd#smallpox-eradication-roi) | 159-400:1 | WHO intensive campaign (1967-1980) |
| [Clean water & sanitation](../references.qmd#clean-water-sanitation-roi) | 4-21:1 | WHO/WaterAid (LMICs) |
| [Childhood vaccinations](../references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi) | 10-16:1 | CDC immunization economic analyses |
| Average pharma drug | 2:1 | Industry standard (Tufts CSDD) |

The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty/dFDA system **rivals or exceeds the ROI of smallpox eradication**, previously considered the gold standard of public health interventions. For detailed comparisons across all major health interventions, see [Intervention Comparison Table](../appendix/intervention-comparison-table.qmd).

### Self-Funding Mechanism Through Military Budget Redirection

{{< include ../figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty financing structure creates a self-funding system requiring zero net new spending from donors or taxpayers.

**Economic Structure** ([see detailed calculation](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)):

- **Funding Source**: [$27.2B annually](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) from 1% redirection of existing military budgets (money already allocated in national budgets)
- **Annual Benefits**: {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} (Peace dividend: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} + R&D savings: [$50.0B](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd))
- **Operating Costs**: {{< var treaty_total_annual_costs >}} annually (campaign operations and dFDA infrastructure)
- **Net Position**: [{{< var treaty_total_annual_benefits >}} annual surplus](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) after all costs
- **Lives Saved**: {{< var treaty_total_lives_saved_annual >}} annually

$$
925{,}610 \text{ QALYs} \div 35 \text{ QALYs/life} = 26{,}446 \text{ lives}
$$

- **Cost per Life Saved**: Net societal benefit of `{python} cost_per_life_investor_funded_formatted` per life ([negative cost](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) indicates net profit)

This financing structure classifies the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty as a **dominant health intervention** using standard health economics terminology, an intervention with both lower costs and better health outcomes than the status quo, requiring no trade-off between cost-effectiveness and impact.

The self-funding nature eliminates traditional barriers to scale, as the intervention generates sufficient economic surplus to sustain and expand operations without ongoing charitable contributions.

## The Complete Case: {{< var roi_all_direct_benefits >}}:1 ROI (All Direct Benefits)

The conservative {{< var roi_dfda_savings_only >}} calculation deliberately excludes most system benefits to establish a defensible floor. A comprehensive analysis including all eight quantifiable primary benefit categories demonstrates substantially higher returns.

### {{< var total_complete_benefits_annual >}} in Annual Benefits

The complete benefit framework encompasses eight measurable categories. Total annual benefit $B_{\text{total}}$ is calculated as:

$$
B_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^{8} B_i = B_{\text{peace}} + B_{\text{R\&D}} + B_{\text{access}} + B_{\text{research}} + B_{\text{rare}} + B_{\text{prices}} + B_{\text{prevention}} + B_{\text{mental}}
$$

where each benefit category is:

1. **Peace dividend** ({{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}) - Societal savings from 1% less conflict
2. **R&D cost savings** ([{{< var current_drug_approvals_per_year >}}](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)) - {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} cheaper trials
3. **7-year access acceleration** ([{{< var global_annual_infrastructure_damage_communications_conflict >}}](../appendix/economic-value-of-accelerated-treatments.qmd)) - Earlier treatment access during trials
4. **Research acceleration** ([{{< var global_annual_environmental_damage_conflict >}}](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)) - 115X more research capacity (10-20X more breakthroughs)
5. **Rare disease treatments** ({{< var benefit_rare_diseases_annual >}}) - Economically viable orphan drug development for [300M patients](../references.qmd#rare-disease-patients-300m-globally) with diseases lacking treatments ([{{< var dfda_trial_completion_rate >}} of {{< var rare_diseases_count_global >}}+ rare diseases](../references.qmd#95-pct-diseases-no-treatment) have no FDA-approved therapy)
6. **Drug price reductions** ({{< var global_annual_environmental_damage_conflict >}}) - Conservative estimate based on [U.S. drug prices {{< var us_drug_price_multiplier_vs_peer_countries >}} higher](../references.qmd#us-drug-prices-vs-peer-countries) than peer countries ({{< var us_annual_drug_spending >}} annual U.S. spending; 20-{{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} reduction potential = {{< var drug_price_reduction_savings_low >}}-180B from U.S. alone)
7. **Prevention medicine** ($100.0B) - Based on [global clinical trial market](../appendix/global-clinical-trial-spending-by-phase.qmd) projections exceeding {{< var global_clinical_trial_market_annual >}} annually, enabling economically viable prevention studies
8. **Mental health** ($75.0B) - Conservative partial closure of {{< var sensitivity_peace_dividend_optimistic >}} funding gap identified for global mental health care needs

$$
B_{\text{total}} = 113.6 + 50.0 + 300.0 + 100.0 + 400.0 + 100.0 + 100.0 + 75.0 = \$1,238.6\text{B} \approx \$1.2\text{T}
$$

#### Complete Case ROI

$$
\text{ROI}_{\text{complete}} = \frac{\$1,238.6\text{B annual} \times 10\text{ years}}{\$1.0\text{B implementation}} = 1,239:1
$$

where [{{< var dfda_roi_simple >}}](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) is the total annual benefit across all eight categories, 10 years is the NPV-adjusted time horizon, and [{{< var peace_dividend_environmental >}}](campaign-budget.qmd) is the total implementation cost. The two largest contributors—**earlier access acceleration** and **research capacity expansion**—are often misunderstood as the same thing. They're not:

- **Earlier Access** = Patients access the SAME treatments 7 years sooner (during trials instead of post-approval)
- **Research Acceleration** = System runs 115X MORE trials, finding 10-20X MORE breakthroughs

Both are conservative estimates based on proven models ([RECOVERY trial](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) costs, disease prevalence data, standard QALY valuations).

### Research Acceleration Mechanism: How We Get 115X

The {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}} research acceleration multiplier is derived from specific, measurable improvements across four dimensions:

**Current System Baseline**:

- {{< var current_trials_per_year >}} clinical trials initiated per year
- [60% completion rate](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) = **{{< var current_completed_trials_per_year >}} completed trials/year**
- [{{< var current_active_trials >}} active trials](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) at any time (3-5 year duration)
- [{{< var current_patient_eligibility_rate >}} patient eligibility](../appendix/clinical-trial-participants.qmd) (5M trial slots for [2.4B people with chronic disease](../references.qmd#disease-prevalence-2-billion))
- [{{< var current_trial_abandonment_rate >}} abandonment rate](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) (studies never complete)
- [6-18 months to recruit 100 patients](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)

**dFDA System Performance**:

- {{< var dfda_trials_per_year_capacity >}} trials/year capacity
- [95% completion rate](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) = **{{< var dfda_completed_trials_per_year >}} completed trials/year**
- [{{< var dfda_active_trials >}} active trials](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) at any time (3-12 month duration)
- [{{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} patient eligibility](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) ([1.2B eligible](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) with minimal exclusions)
- [{{< var dfda_trial_abandonment_rate >}} abandonment rate](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) (economic incentives flipped)
- [3 weeks to recruit {{< var traditional_large_trial_size >}} patients](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)

**Multiplier Derivation**:

| Factor | Current | dFDA | Multiplier |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| **[Recruitment Speed](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** | 6-18 months for 100 patients | 3 weeks for {{< var traditional_large_trial_size >}} patients | **[25x](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |
| **[Trial Completion Speed](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** | 3-5 years (perverse incentives) | 3-12 months (aligned incentives) | **[10x](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |

| **Funding Increase** | [$67.5B medical research](../appendix/global-government-medical-research-spending.qmd) | [$94.7B](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) ($67.5B + {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}) | **[1.4x](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |

**Theoretical Maximum**:

$$
25 \times 10 \times 1.6 \times 1.4 = 560
$$

This represents **[{{< var completed_trials_multiplier_theoretical_max >}}](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** more completed trials per year

**Conservative Estimate**: [{{< var completed_trials_multiplier_actual >}}](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) accounting for real-world friction (ramp-up, adoption, learning curves)

**Used in Analysis**: **[{{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** (further conservative adjustment for foundation grant proposal credibility)

This represents:

- From {{< var current_completed_trials_per_year >}} completed trials/year → [227,700 completed trials/year](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) (115x)
- From [50 drug approvals/year](../references.qmd#global-new-drug-approvals-50-annually) → [1,000-{{< var dfda_drug_approvals_per_year_high >}} approvals/year](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) (20-40x)
- From [$41,000 cost per patient](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) → {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}}-1,000 cost per patient ([82x cost reduction](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd), proven by Oxford RECOVERY trial)

## Personal Economic Impact: From Societal to Individual

The aggregate societal benefits ({{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}}-{{< var total_complete_benefits_annual >}} annually) result from individual economic gains multiplied across billions of people. Understanding individual impact helps explain both the scale and the equity of the Disease Eradication Model.

{{< include ../figures/disease-eradication-annual-benefits-stacked-area-chart.qmd >}}

For detailed analysis of personal wealth calculations, see [Disease Eradication Model: Personal Lifetime Wealth](../appendix/disease-eradication-personal-lifetime-wealth-calculations.qmd).

## Problem Statement and Opportunity Cost

### Current Resource Allocation

Global spending on health-related challenges demonstrates significant misalignment between resource allocation and burden of disease (see [Humanity's Budget](../appendix/humanity-budget-overview.qmd) for complete breakdown):

- **Military spending**: [{{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}} trillion annually](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending) ([40X](../appendix/humanity-budget-overview.qmd) [medical research funding](../appendix/global-government-medical-research-spending.qmd))
- **Symptomatic disease treatment**: [{{< var global_symptomatic_disease_treatment_annual >}} annually](../references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t) (primarily managing chronic conditions rather than curative interventions)
- **Economic burden of disease**: [{{< var global_disease_economic_burden_annual >}} annually](../references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t) in lost productivity, premature mortality, and disability-adjusted life years
- **Total annual cost**: [{{< var global_total_health_and_war_cost_annual >}}](../appendix/humanity-budget-overview.qmd)

**Current investment in curative research**:

- Global government medical research: [{{< var global_med_research_spending >}} billion annually](../appendix/global-government-medical-research-spending.qmd)

$$
\frac{\$68\text{B}}{\$128.6\text{T}} = 0.053\% \text{ of total disease burden}
$$

- Disease eradication achievements: Zero in past 50 years (since [smallpox, 1980](../references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated))
- Resource allocation ratio: 1:40 (medical research : military spending)

{{< include ../figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-1-percent-treaty-column-chart.qmd >}}

### Mortality and Morbidity Burden

<!-- ![Annual deaths from disease ({{< var global_annual_deaths_curable_diseases >}}) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](../../assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png) -->

The World Health Organization reports {{< var global_daily_deaths_curable_diseases >}} daily deaths from preventable or potentially curable diseases ([54.75 million annually](../references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)). This mortality burden exceeds:

- [Annual terrorism deaths](../references.qmd#chance-of-dying-from-terrorism-1-in-30m) by a factor of [{{< var disease_vs_terrorism_deaths_ratio >}}](../references.qmd#chance-of-dying-from-terrorism-1-in-30m)

$$
\frac{54.75\text{M disease deaths}}{3{,}000\text{ terrorism deaths}} \approx 18{,}274:1
$$

- [Annual war deaths](../references.qmd#acled-active-combat-deaths) by a factor of 137:1 (based on {{< var global_annual_conflict_deaths_total >}} conflict deaths annually)

$$
\frac{54.75\text{M disease deaths}}{400{,}000\text{ conflict deaths}} \approx 137:1
$$

Despite this disparity in mortality burden, resource allocation heavily favors security spending over medical research and curative interventions.

## How This Compares to History

### Better Than the Best Charities

Here's how it compares to the most effective charities in the world ([GiveWell top charities](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)):

| Intervention | Cost to Achieve Outcome | This Initiative's Equivalent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[GiveWell Top Charities](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)** (e.g., Against Malaria Foundation) | Spend **~`{python} givewell_cost_per_life_min_formatted` - `{python} givewell_cost_per_life_max_formatted`** to save one life | Generate **{{< var global_dfda_qalys_gained_annual >}} QALYs** annually while creating **[$249.3B](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)** in net economic value |

**The Difference**: GiveWell's charities are the best ways to spend money to save lives. They cost money but save lives very efficiently.

This plan doesn't cost money, it *makes* money while saving lives. Instead of asking people to donate, it makes everyone richer while curing diseases.

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend `{python} givewell_cost_per_life_min_formatted`-`{python} givewell_cost_per_life_max_formatted` to save a life (which is excellent), the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society `{python} cost_per_life_investor_funded_formatted` per life saved**.

### Better Than History's Best Public Health Wins

| Intervention | How it Creates Value | Scale of Annual Net Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Childhood Vaccinations](../references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi)** | Prevents immense long-term treatment costs for diseases like measles and polio | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Smoking Cessation** | Prevents expensive chronic diseases (cancer, heart disease) through low-cost interventions | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **[Water & Sanitation](../references.qmd#clean-water-sanitation-roi)** | Avoids disease costs for entire populations at low cost | Hundreds of Millions to Billions |
| **[1% Treaty (Peace Dividend)](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | Reduces global conflict costs by 1%, creating massive economic benefit | **~113.6B, Annually** |
| **[dFDA (R&D Efficiency)](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)** | Makes clinical research ~82x more efficient, unlocking huge R&D savings | **~$50.0B, Annually** |

#### Why This Is Different

Vaccines and smoking cessation programs are amazing, they solve specific problems with a high return.

The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty and dFDA initiative tackles two problems at once:

1. **The Peace Dividend** is a massive economic gain on par with the largest public health wins, created simply by reducing a global negative (conflict)
2. **The dFDA** then uses a tiny fraction of that gain to fix the *system* of medical research, generating a *second* massive win

Instead of solving one problem, this uses a global-scale win to fund a system-scale win. When you redirect the world's largest source of waste to fund its most impactful opportunity, the math gets wild.

### 10X Larger Than Childhood Vaccinations

{{< include ../figures/health-programs-vs-1-percent-treaty-societal-benefits-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The conservative case annual economic benefit of {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} significantly exceeds the most successful public health programs in history. Comparing to [childhood vaccination programs](../references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi) (estimated [10-20B annual global benefit](../references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi) from preventing measles, polio, etc.):

$$
\text{Relative Scale} = \frac{\$163.6\text{B}}{\sim\$15\text{B}} \approx 11:1
$$

where {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} is the [1% Treaty conservative case benefit](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) and $15B is the estimated [childhood vaccination annual benefit](../references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi).

This makes the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty/dFDA system **[11X larger in economic impact](../appendix/intervention-comparison-table.qmd)** than childhood vaccinations, one of the most successful public health interventions ever implemented.

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} in annual economic surplus (conservative case) to sustain operations and expansion without requiring ongoing charitable contributions.

## The Opportunity Cost Clock

Every second we don't implement this system:

- **$38,051** in foregone economic value

$$
\frac{\$1.2\text{T}}{365 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours} \times 3600 \text{ seconds}} = \$38{,}051/\text{second}
$$

- **1.736 preventable deaths** occur

$$
\frac{54.75\text{M deaths/year}}{365 \times 24 \times 3600 \text{ seconds}} = 1.736 \text{ deaths/second}
$$

**Daily Opportunity Cost**:

- **$3.3B** in foregone economic value

$$
\$1.2\text{T} \div 365 \text{ days} = \$3.3\text{B/day}
$$

- **{{< var global_daily_deaths_curable_diseases >}}** preventable deaths
- **{{< var global_daily_deaths_curable_diseases >}}** individuals experiencing curable disease burden
- **1.736 deaths per second** from addressable conditions

**Annual Opportunity Cost**:

- **{{< var total_complete_benefits_annual >}}** in foregone economic value (complete case benefit)
- **54.75 million** preventable deaths
- **{{< var global_disease_economic_burden_annual >}}** in disease burden continues

These figures represent the mathematical consequence of maintaining current resource allocation patterns versus implementing the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty system.

## Who Benefits and How

The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty creates positive economic incentives across all major groups, eliminating traditional opposition to healthcare system reform. This alignment makes it politically feasible and sustainable.

**Who Gets What** (see [Aligning Incentives](../solution/aligning-incentives.qmd) for details):

- **Defense sector**: Keeps [{{< var defense_sector_retention_pct >}} of current budget](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) 
- **Pharmaceutical industry**: Trial costs shift from expense to revenue (patients fund participation); [research capacity increases 115X](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)
- **Insurance companies**: Net savings from [reduced disease burden](../references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t) ([{{< var global_disease_economic_burden_annual >}} current economic cost](../references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t))
- **Healthcare providers**: More treatment options; [earlier access to effective therapies](../appendix/economic-value-of-accelerated-treatments.qmd)
- **Patients**: Access to clinical trials as healthcare and new treatments years or decades sooner
- **Taxpayers**: Net reduction in taxes and healthcare costs through improved R&D efficiency

See [Aligning Incentives](../solution/aligning-incentives.qmd) for detailed analysis and implementation strategy.

## Implementation Strategy

The economic benefits outlined above demonstrate the value proposition of the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty system. Implementation requires political mobilization to achieve treaty adoption:

**For comprehensive implementation details**, see:

- **[Campaign Budget](campaign-budget.qmd)** - Detailed breakdown of political mobilization costs
- **[VICTORY Social Impact Bonds](victory-bonds.qmd)** - Financing mechanism for lobbying efforts
- **[Financial Plan Overview](financial-plan.qmd)** - Complete fundraising, spending, and treasury management framework

### Campaign Budget Breakdown

The [$1.0B campaign cost](campaign-budget.qmd) (used as denominator in complete case {{< var roi_all_direct_benefits >}}:1 ROI) allocates funds across seven strategic categories:

| Budget Category | Amount | Purpose |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **[Viral Referendum](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_viral_referendum >}} | Global direct democracy campaign, social media amplification, petition platforms |
| **[AI-Assisted Lobbying](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_technology >}} | Automated legislative outreach, personalized constituent messaging, political mapping |
| **[Technology Platform](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_technology >}} | Voting infrastructure, transparency systems, wishocracy implementation |
| **[Legal & Compliance](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_partnerships >}} | International treaty law, regulatory compliance, jurisdictional coordination |
| **[Partnerships](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_partnerships >}} | Coalition building with NGOs, medical organizations, patient advocacy groups |
| **[Operations](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_reserve >}} | Campaign management, communications, logistics, staffing |
| **[Reserve](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_reserve >}} | Contingency for unforeseen challenges and opportunities |
| **Total Campaign Cost** | **{{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}}** | 4-year implementation timeline (amortized: {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_technology >}}/year) |

This budget is designed for a 3-5 year campaign to achieve treaty ratification by major powers, representing less than 4% of the first year's conservative benefits ({{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}}). The campaign cost is a one-time investment with perpetual returns, as the system becomes self-sustaining through the captured peace dividend.

This economic analysis focuses on the return on investment once the system is operational, demonstrating that the intervention generates 463:1 to {{< var roi_all_direct_benefits >}}:1 returns regardless of the specific path to adoption.

## Risk Analysis and Mitigation

### Implementation Risks

**Political Risk**: Treaty adoption requires coordination across multiple national governments

- *Mitigation*: Dual-track approach combining grassroots referendum with diplomatic engagement (see [Treaty Adoption Strategy](../strategy/treaty-adoption-strategy.qmd))
- *Precedent*: Historical military spending reductions have occurred during periods of public mobilization (post-WW2, post-Cold War)

**Technical Risk**: dFDA platform development and scaling challenges

- *Mitigation*: Phased rollout beginning with proven platforms (similar to RECOVERY trial model); open-source architecture enabling distributed development
- *Validation*: Oxford [RECOVERY trial](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) demonstrated 82x cost reduction at scale (11,000+ participants, 6 treatment arms, {{< var dfda_opex_regulatory >}} total cost)

**Adoption Risk**: Insufficient patient enrollment in decentralized trials

- *Mitigation*: Economic incentives (free treatment + compensation); improved trial accessibility; democratized research priorities
- *Evidence*: Current clinical trial participation ([{{< var current_clinical_trial_participation_rate >}} of population](../appendix/clinical-trial-participants.qmd)) limited by access barriers, not willingness

**Financial Risk**: Insufficient funding to achieve referendum threshold and political mobilization

- *Mitigation*: Multi-stage fundraising with milestone-based releases; diversified funding sources; assurance contracts
- *Conservative threshold*: [280M votes](../references.qmd#3-5-rule) ([{{< var global_population_activism_threshold_pct >}} of global population](../references.qmd#3-5-rule)) through viral referendum mechanics

See [Investor Risk Analysis](../appendix/investor-risk-analysis.qmd) for complete risk assessment and sensitivity analysis.

### Governance and Accountability

**DIH Treasury Governance**: [Wishocratic system](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) enabling democratic allocation of research funding

- [8 billion potential participants](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) (any human) vs. current centralized decision-making ([200 NIH staff](../references.qmd#nih-decision-makers-200-people))
- Quadratic voting mechanism prevents plutocratic capture
- Transparent, auditable allocation via blockchain-based system

**dFDA Platform Governance**: Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure

- Open-source protocols ensuring transparency and reproducibility
- Distributed validation preventing single-point failures
- Regulatory compliance framework integrating with national authorities

**Financial Accountability**: Independent oversight and reporting

- Annual third-party audits of DIH treasury and dFDA operations
- Public reporting of all expenditures and outcomes
- Milestone-based funding releases tied to measurable objectives

See [Governance Framework](../appendix/governance.qmd) and [Legal Compliance Framework](../appendix/legal-compliance-framework.qmd) for complete governance structures.

## Conclusion

This economic analysis demonstrates that redirecting 1% of global military spending to medical research through the Decentralized Institutes of Health and Decentralized FDA system generates return on investment ranging from 463:1 (conservative estimate) to {{< var roi_all_direct_benefits >}}:1 (complete estimate), depending on analytical scope.

**Key Findings**:

- **Self-funding structure**: Zero net new spending required (funds redirected from existing military budgets)
- **Dominant intervention**: Simultaneously reduces costs and improves health outcomes
- **Conservative ROI**: [{{< var roi_dfda_savings_only >}}](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) based solely on R&D efficiency gains

$$
\frac{\$249.3\text{B NPV benefit}}{\$538\text{M NPV cost}} = 463:1
$$

(see [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd))

- **Complete ROI**: {{< var roi_all_direct_benefits >}}:1 including all eight quantifiable benefit categories ({{< var total_complete_benefits_annual >}} annual benefit)
- **Lives saved**: {{< var treaty_total_lives_saved_annual >}} annually at net societal benefit of [$6.56M per life](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)
- **Political feasibility**: Positive economic incentives across all major stakeholder groups

**Comparative Context**: This intervention rivals or exceeds the cost-effectiveness of history's most successful public health achievements (see [Intervention Comparison Table](../appendix/intervention-comparison-table.qmd) for detailed ROI comparisons including smallpox eradication and childhood vaccinations) while requiring no ongoing charitable funding.

**Implementation Pathway**: Phased approach beginning with global referendum and political mobilization, proceeding through treaty adoption, DIH establishment, and dFDA deployment over [36 months](../strategy/roadmap.qmd) (see [Roadmap](../strategy/roadmap.qmd) for complete implementation timeline).

The economic case is grounded in conservative assumptions, validated against peer-reviewed evidence (particularly the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd)), and subjected to comprehensive [sensitivity analysis](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd). The methodology employs standard health economics frameworks (NPV, QALYs, ICER) to enable comparison with existing interventions and facilitate foundation grant evaluation processes.
