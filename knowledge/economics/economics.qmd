## Abstract

**Objective**: Evaluate the economic and health outcomes of reallocating {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military spending ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually) to subsidize universal patient participation in pragmatic clinical trials modeled on the Oxford RECOVERY trial approach, where patient subsidies make trial participation financially attractive for both patients and treatment providers.

**Methods**: Cost-benefit analysis, net present value (NPV) calculations, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) modeling, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) analysis. Data from SIPRI military expenditure database, WHO mortality statistics, Oxford RECOVERY trial results, and published clinical trial cost literature. Both conservative (R&D efficiency only) and complete (all quantifiable benefits) scenarios assessed.

**Results**: Every day of delay costs **{{< var global_disease_deaths_daily >}} lives** from curable diseases. The intervention achieves **{{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}} per DALY** ({{< var treaty_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x more cost-effective than bed nets at {{< var bed_nets_cost_per_daly >}}/DALY). Even accounting for political risk (10% success probability), expected cost-effectiveness is **{{< var treaty_expected_cost_per_daly_conservative >}} per DALY** ({{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x better than bed nets). Complete analysis demonstrates {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 ROI with **recurring annual benefits** of {{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual >}} (peace dividend + R&D savings), plus {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}x research acceleration that compresses 20 years of progress into {{< var research_acceleration_cumulative_years_20yr >}} research-equivalent years. One-time {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}}-year timeline shift averts {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} total DALYs, eliminates {{< var suffering_hours_eliminated_total >}} hours of human suffering, and saves {{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} lives ({{< var eventually_avoidable_death_pct >}} eventually avoidable). This is a cost-dominant intervention that saves money while saving lives. Conservative analysis yields {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI from R&D efficiency alone. Sensitivity analysis shows robust returns even when everything goes wrong ({{< var treaty_conservative_scenario_roi >}}:1 worst-case to {{< var treaty_optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 best-case).

**Conclusions**: Redirecting {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of military spending to medical research represents a dominant health intervention, simultaneously reducing costs while improving health outcomes, with ROI exceeding smallpox eradication and every other public health achievement in history. The self-funding structure (money appears from reduced military spending) eliminates traditional barriers to scale. Unlike charity, which requires infinite begging to finite donors, this generates {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} in **recurring annual surplus** (peace dividend + R&D savings) every year perpetually, plus a one-time 8.2-year acceleration in disease eradication.

**Keywords**: {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty, Victory Bonds, Decentralized FDA, Decentralized Institutes of Health, self-funding health intervention, negative cost per life saved, {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 to {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 ROI, regulatory efficacy lag elimination, greed-aligned incentives

## Key Findings

0. **Cost of Delay**: Every day without this intervention costs:
   - **{{< var global_disease_deaths_daily >}} lives lost** from the {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}}-year post-safety efficacy lag (Phase II/III delay, NOT safety testing)
   - **{{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} DALYs foregone** total over the timeline shift (years of healthy life lost to regulatory delay)

1. **Cost-Effectiveness (Conditional on Success)**:
   - **{{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}} per DALY** ({{< var treaty_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x better than bed nets at {{< var bed_nets_cost_per_daly >}}/DALY)
   - **{{< var treaty_expected_cost_per_daly_conservative >}} per DALY** even at 10% political success probability (still {{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x better than bed nets)
   - Comparable to deworming ($4-10/DALY), the gold standard for cost-effectiveness

2. **Conservative ROI**: {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 (R&D efficiency only)
   - {{< var dfda_npv_benefit_rd_only >}} benefit / {{< var dfda_npv_total_cost >}} cost over {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years

3. **Complete ROI**: {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 (R&D efficiency + peace dividend)
   - {{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual >}} annual benefits / {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} campaign cost

3a. **Total Economic Value**: {{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}}
   - One-time value from 8.2-year timeline shift in disease eradication
   - Monetized value of {{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} lives and {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} healthy life-years gained
   - Investment required: {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}}

4. **Self-Funding**: Zero new spending, just move {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually) from {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}} total military spending

5. **Lives Saved**: {{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} total ({{< var eventually_avoidable_death_pct >}} eventually avoidable) from eliminating the {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}}-year regulatory lag at net societal **profit** per life
   - One-time timeline shift benefit, not annual recurring (excludes {{< var fundamentally_unavoidable_death_pct >}} fundamentally unavoidable deaths like accidents)
   - (The number is positive. You make money saving lives. Economics is backwards here.)

6. **Dominant Intervention**: Cost-dominant intervention (saves money while saving lives)
   - Beats smallpox eradication ({{< var smallpox_eradication_roi >}}:1 {{< var smallpox_eradication_roi_cite >}})
   - Generates profit per life saved rather than requiring subsidy

7. **Research Acceleration**: {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× faster medical progress = {{< var research_acceleration_cumulative_years_20yr >}} research-equivalent years in 20 years
   - Compresses decades of progress into years (from removing the bureaucratic performance art)

8. **Robust Returns**: Even if costs double and benefits halve, still get {{< var treaty_conservative_scenario_roi >}}:1 to {{< var treaty_optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 ROI

## For Decision Makers: Three Numbers That Matter

1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: {{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}} per DALY ({{< var treaty_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x better than bed nets at {{< var bed_nets_cost_per_daly >}}/DALY)
   - Even at 10% success probability: {{< var treaty_expected_cost_per_daly_conservative >}} per DALY (still {{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x better than bed nets)

2. **Scale**: {{< var global_disease_deaths_daily >}} deaths per day = {{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} lives over {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}}-year timeline shift
   - {{< var eventually_avoidable_death_pct >}} eventually avoidable with sufficient biomedical research

3. **Innovation**: {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}x research acceleration = {{< var research_acceleration_cumulative_years_20yr >}} research-equivalent years in 20 years
   - Compresses decades of medical progress into years

**The question isn't whether this is cost-effective. The question is whether $1B can achieve treaty passage.**

## Research Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis**: Reallocating {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military spending ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually) to fund decentralized pragmatic clinical trials generates return on investment between {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 (conservative estimate, R&D savings only) and {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 (complete estimate, including peace dividend and all direct benefits), representing a dominant health intervention that simultaneously reduces costs while improving health outcomes.

**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The intervention does not generate positive net economic value (ROI ≤ 1:1)

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The intervention generates substantial positive returns (ROI > 1:1), comparable to or exceeding history's most successful public health interventions (smallpox eradication: {{< var smallpox_eradication_roi >}}:1 {{< var smallpox_eradication_roi_cite >}})

**Testable Predictions**:

- Conservative case: NPV benefit exceeds $100B over {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}}-year horizon
- Cost-effectiveness: ICER < $0/QALY (cost-saving while improving health)
- Research acceleration: {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× increase in completed trials per year
- Self-funding threshold: Annual benefits exceed annual costs by year 3 of implementation


::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Nomenclature and Key Terms

**NPV (Net Present Value)**: Economic metric that discounts future cash flows to present-day values, accounting for the time value of money. Used to compare costs and benefits occurring at different times.

**QALY (Quality-Adjusted Life Year)**: Standard health economics measure combining quantity and quality of life. One QALY = one year of life in perfect health. Used to compare health interventions across different conditions.

**ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio)**: Cost per QALY gained, calculated as (Cost_intervention - Cost_baseline) / (QALY_intervention - QALY_baseline). Negative ICER indicates cost savings while improving health (dominant intervention).

**ROI (Return on Investment)**: Ratio of net benefits to costs. Calculated as NPV(Benefits) / NPV(Costs) for time-adjusted analysis, or Annual Benefits / Annual Costs for simple analysis.

**dFDA (Decentralized FDA)**: Proposed system for conducting clinical trials using real-world data, electronic health records, and decentralized patient participation. Reduces per-patient costs by 50-95% compared to traditional trials.

**DIH (Decentralized Institutes of Health)**: Proposed global research infrastructure funded by 1% of military spending reallocation, coordinating decentralized clinical trials and medical research.

**Peace Dividend**: Economic benefits from reduced military spending, including fiscal savings, reduced conflict-related economic damage, and favorable economic multiplier effects from reallocating resources to productive sectors.

**Dominant Intervention**: Health economics term for interventions that both reduce costs AND improve health outcomes. Unconditionally recommended regardless of willingness-to-pay thresholds (e.g., vaccination programs, smoking cessation).

**1% Treaty**: Proposed international agreement where signatory nations commit to reducing military expenditure by 1% and redirecting those funds ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} globally) to medical research infrastructure.

**Pragmatic Clinical Trial**: Trial design using real-world settings and broad eligibility criteria rather than highly controlled laboratory conditions. Reduces costs while improving generalizability (e.g., Oxford RECOVERY trial).

### The Highest-ROI Public Health Intervention

Shift {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military spending into decentralized clinical trials. That's it. That's the entire plan.

## Problem Statement

### Current Resource Allocation

Humanity's budget priorities, explained simply:

- **Military spending**: {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}}/year (ending life)

- **Medical research**: {{< var global_med_research_spending >}} {{< var global_med_research_spending_cite >}} /year (extending life)

- **Ratio**: {{< var military_vs_medical_research_ratio >}}:1 (you spend {{< var military_vs_medical_research_ratio >}}× more on creating corpses than preventing them)

#### Disease treatment vs. curing disease

- **Symptomatic treatment**: {{< var global_symptomatic_disease_treatment_annual >}} {{< var global_symptomatic_disease_treatment_annual_cite >}}/year (managing symptoms, not fixing root causes)

- **Disease burden**: {{< var global_disease_economic_burden_annual >}}/year in lost productivity, premature death, disability

- **Curative research**: {{< var global_med_research_spending >}} {{< var global_med_research_spending_cite >}} billion/year

That's {{< var medical_research_pct_of_disease_burden >}} of the disease burden spent on actually fixing the problem:

{{< var medical_research_pct_of_disease_burden_latex >}}

#### Results of this strategy

- Diseases eradicated in past 50 years: **Zero** ([smallpox was 1980](../references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated))
- Military vs. medical research: **{{< var military_vs_medical_research_ratio >}}:1** ratio

It's like spending $40 on gasoline for a fire and $1 on a fire extinguisher.

*"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed."* - President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1961

**Opportunity cost note:** The {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} could fund other things: military R&D (GPS, internet came from this), tax cuts (~{{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} private returns), infrastructure, education, climate. But the dFDA's cost-dominant intervention status (saves money while improving health) means it makes money while saving lives. Dominant interventions don't require opportunity cost tradeoffs - they're just better at everything.

{{< include ../figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-1-percent-treaty-column-chart.qmd >}}

### Mortality and Morbidity Burden

The World Health Organization reports {{< var global_daily_deaths_curable_diseases >}} {{< var global_daily_deaths_curable_diseases_cite >}} daily deaths from preventable or potentially curable diseases ({{< var global_annual_deaths_curable_diseases >}} [annually](../references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)).

<!-- ![Annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](../../assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png) -->

This mortality burden exceeds:

- [Annual terrorism deaths](../references.qmd#chance-of-dying-from-terrorism-1-in-30m) by a factor of {{< var disease_vs_terrorism_deaths_ratio >}}

{{< var disease_vs_terrorism_deaths_ratio_latex >}}

- [Annual war deaths](../references.qmd#acled-active-combat-deaths) by a factor of {{< var disease_vs_war_deaths_ratio >}}:1 (based on {{< var global_annual_conflict_deaths_total >}} conflict deaths annually)

{{< var disease_vs_war_deaths_ratio_latex >}}

Despite this disparity in mortality burden, resource allocation heavily favors security spending over medical research and curative interventions.

## How It Actually Works

The mechanism is financial, not bureaucratic:

1. **Patient subsidies**: Most treaty funding ({{< var dih_treasury_trial_subsidies_annual >}}) goes directly to subsidizing patient participation in trials at ~{{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient - similar to how insurance covers medical procedures
2. **Providers get paid**: Treatment providers can charge for patient participation in trials, making trials profitable rather than costly
3. **Easy enrollment**: A streamlined FDA wrapper (costing just {{< var dfda_annual_opex >}}) makes it easy for anyone to create or join Phase 2/3/4 trials
4. **Patient choice**: Patients choose which trials to join; their subsidy follows them. Trials that attract patients get funded. No grant committees deciding what's "worthy."

This isn't "funding infrastructure" - it's making trial participation financially attractive for both patients and providers while removing regulatory friction.

## The Result

**{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 to {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 ROI**

### Total Economic Value

**{{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}}** in total economic value from eliminating the {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}}-year regulatory delay.

This is the monetized value of {{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} lives saved and {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} healthy life-years gained by moving disease eradication {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}} years earlier. It's a one-time timeline shift, not an annual benefit.

**Investment required**: {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}}

That's a quadrillion-dollar bill lying on the ground. The only question is whether humanity picks it up.

### Research Acceleration

{{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× faster medical progress ({{< var research_acceleration_cumulative_years_20yr >}} of medical advancement in 20 years)

{{< var research_acceleration_multiplier_latex >}}

{{< var research_acceleration_cumulative_years_20yr_latex >}}

### Suffering Reduction

{{< var suffering_hours_eliminated_total >}} hours of human suffering eliminated (one-time benefit from 8.2-year timeline shift)

{{< var suffering_hours_eliminated_total_latex >}}

### Lives Saved

**{{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} lives from one-time timeline shift**

{{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total_latex >}}

- **{{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} from dFDA** (eliminating {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}}-year post-safety efficacy lag - one-time benefit)
- **{{< var treaty_lives_saved_annual_global >}}/year from peace dividend** ({{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} conflict reduction - recurring annual benefit)

For context: **{{< var global_disease_deaths_daily >}} people die every day** under the current regulatory system waiting for drug approval.

::: {.callout-note}
## Why "Eventually Avoidable" Matters

Of {{< var global_disease_deaths_daily >}} daily deaths:
- **{{< var eventually_avoidable_death_pct >}} eventually avoidable** with sufficient biomedical research (gene therapy, AI drug discovery, cellular reprogramming, etc.)
- **{{< var fundamentally_unavoidable_death_pct >}} fundamentally unavoidable** (primarily accidents, even with advanced prevention)

This distinction maintains intellectual honesty while acknowledging that most disease deaths are preventable with advanced biotechnology. The calculation accounts for maximum achievable cure rates by disease category based on research acceleration potential.
:::

### Annual Savings

{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} + [$50–100B](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd#total-annual-economic-benefits) saved per year.

These aren't projections. They're measurements:

* **Oxford RECOVERY** proved trials cost **{{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}× less** by using existing hospital infrastructure instead of dedicated trial sites
* This single trial enrolled [49,000](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-82x-cost-reduction) patients across [185](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-82x-cost-reduction) hospitals, found [dexamethasone (reducing COVID deaths 33%)](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-dexamethasone-results), ruled out hydroxychloroquine, and identified effective treatments faster than traditional regulatory processes
* The bottleneck isn't scientific knowledge
* The bottleneck is requiring dedicated trial infrastructure when hospitals already exist

Medical progress currently flows through a coffee stirrer.
This makes it a fire hose.


## Why {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Is Enough

### 1. The Peace Dividend

{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/year

Bombs are expensive. Breaking things costs money. Repairing broken things costs more money.
A {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} reduction in weapons procurement saves {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} annually.
That's roughly the GDP of Austria, just sitting there in the "please don't explode us" budget.

### 2. The Research Efficiency Dividend

{{< var dfda_rd_gross_savings_annual >}}–{{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual >}} {{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual_cite >}}

Traditional trials require:

* Dedicated trial sites with custom infrastructure (RECOVERY used existing hospitals)
* Extensive source data verification and monitoring visits (RECOVERY used routine medical records)
* Complex eligibility criteria excluding most patients (RECOVERY enrolled any hospitalized COVID patient)
* Detailed case report forms capturing hundreds of data points (RECOVERY collected <10 core outcomes)
* Years of site activation and regulatory approval per country (RECOVERY activated 185 sites in weeks)

Pragmatic trials skip this performance art entirely.
This is why costs drop **{{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}}×** instead of 2× or 5×.

### 3. 15–40 "NIH equivalents" of new research capacity

For the first time in human history, medical progress would advance **faster than disease progression**.
Currently, diseases are winning the race.
This reverses the score.


## And It Strengthens National Security

Here's the beautiful part: everyone reduces by {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} simultaneously.

### What doesn't change

* Power balances (everyone cuts equally)
* Deterrence (still plenty of weapons)
* Force ratios (relative strength identical)
* Strategic stability (same as before, just {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} less apocalyptic)
* Nuclear posture (can still end civilization 19 times instead of 20)

### What improves

* Fewer deployed warheads (less probability someone launches by mistake)
* Lower accidental-launch risk (fewer deployed warheads to malfunction)
* Reduced crisis instability (everyone's slightly less twitchy)
* Fewer weapons = fewer things that can catastrophically malfunction

It's like everyone agreeing to point {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} fewer guns at each other.
The threat stays balanced. The risk of everyone dying drops.


## Why This Works: The Political Economy

Good ideas don't win because they're good.
They win by **aligning incentives**.

This is the alignment engine:


## Victory Bonds: The Greed-Alignment Engine

You make this happen by aligning financial incentives with their own future savings.

### The Mechanism

1. Investors buy **Victory Bonds** funding the political campaign ({{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}})
2. Bond funds finance lobbying to redirect {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of military spending
3. When the treaty passes, it generates {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} in annual benefits
4. Bondholders receive {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual returns from the captured surplus

It's **public choice theory applied correctly**: Self-interest becomes a public good.

Nobody has to become a better person.
Nobody has to evolve morally.
They just follow their calculator to accidentally save humanity.

{{< include ../figures/victory-bonds-money-flow-diagram.qmd >}}

### Why Every Type of Human Will Do This

**Defense Contractors**: "Keep {{< var defense_sector_retention_pct >}} of your current budget AND get {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns on Victory Bonds."

**Insurance Companies**: "Healthy people file fewer claims than dead people. Dead people file zero claims, which sounds ideal until you realize they also pay zero premiums, creating a revenue problem. This fixes that."

**Pharmaceutical Companies**: "Instead of paying {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_example_48k >}} {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_example_48k_cite >}} per trial patient, patients bring {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} subsidies that YOU collect when they enroll. Your trial costs become revenue. We call it 'reverse expenses' or 'profit.'"

**Politicians**: "{{< var treaty_campaign_voting_bloc_target >}} million voters want this. Your opponent supports it. You can either agree or explain why you prefer bombs to grandma's cancer treatment."

**Billionaires**: "Your index fund makes {{< var average_market_return_pct >}} returns. Victory Bonds make {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}}."

**Regular Humans**: "Get subsidized to try experimental treatments your doctor recommends. Choose which trial to join - your subsidy follows you. Plus: lifetime wealth gains and extra years of life from the [economic multiplier effect](../call-to-action/your-personal-benefits.qmd)."

You just point everyone's greed at diseases instead of each other.

See [Aligning Incentives](../solution/aligning-incentives.qmd) for complete analysis.

## The Mechanical Sequence (How to Actually Do This)

This isn't utopian. It's a checklist:

### Step 1: Run the Survey

Demonstrate overwhelming global support for medical acceleration over military acceleration.
Creates legitimacy. Generates media attention. Makes politicians nervous.

### Step 2: Reach the Tipping Point

Hit {{< var global_population_activism_threshold_pct >}}

Social-movement science: **{{< var global_population_activism_threshold_pct >}} {{< var global_population_activism_threshold_pct_cite >}} committed support** reliably causes policy adoption.
This is the tipping point. Once you cross it, politicians follow or lose elections.

### Step 3: Sell the Bonds

Victory Bond investors fund the campaign because the returns exceed comparable investment opportunities.
They're buying ${{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} in returns for every $100 invested.
It's the Louisiana Purchase of medical research.

### Step 4: Run the Lobbying Campaign

Deploy Victory Bond funds to convince politicians that voters want this.
Standard lobbying tactics, just pointed at healing instead of killing.
Politicians discover they've "always cared deeply about medical research."

### Step 5: Build the Infrastructure

The 1% shift funds globally scaled pragmatic trial infrastructure modeled on RECOVERY's approach.
Thousands of neglected treatments finally get tested.
Effective ones scale instantly.

**Technical requirements:** Building this requires EHR interoperability, data standards, automated analysis pipelines, and regulatory framework updates. RECOVERY demonstrated the core model works; scaling requires infrastructure investment but no fundamental technical breakthroughs. The challenge is deployment and adoption, not invention.

### Step 6: Watch What Happens

- Medical progress accelerates {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}×
- Disease categories start collapsing
- Healthspan overtakes pathology
- Investors profit massively
- Governments save money
- Everyone becomes healthier, safer, richer

The plan works because **every step is economically rational for everyone involved**.
Nobody needs to be convinced. They just need to count.

**Implementation complexity:** Coordinating global treaty adoption, building technical infrastructure, and integrating with existing health systems presents significant logistical challenges. However, these are coordination problems with aligned incentives, not conflicts of interest. Similar to how nations coordinated on the Montreal Protocol (ozone layer) or the International Space Station despite complexity, the economic case makes cooperation rational even for self-interested actors.


## Why This Is the Dominant Strategy

If your goal is to maximize:

* Years humans spend alive and healthy (QALYs)
* Lifespan
* Productivity
* Economic growth
* National security
* Existential safety
* Not suffering unnecessarily

...then this isn't "a good policy."
It's the **mathematically dominant strategy**.

A $1B invested here generates more:

- Health
- Survival
- Stability
- Prosperity
- Innovation
- Safety

...than any other known use of $1B.

Not bed nets (excellent).
Not research grants (helpful).
Not climate interventions (necessary).
Not economic reforms (worthwhile).
Not AI safety (urgent).
Not other treaties (good luck).

All valuable. All recommended.
None offer **{{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× leverage**.


## The Math (Or: How to Prove Obvious Things to Skeptics)

Economists require elaborate rituals before believing simple truths like "curing diseases is better than bombing people." So here's the math they demanded.

This analysis uses three economic tools that sound complicated but aren't:

1. **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Future money is worth less than current money because humans are impatient
2. **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**: A year of life spent healthy beats a year spent dying (economists needed a formula for this)
3. **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Money out divided by money in (this is apparently graduate-level economics)

The methodology follows standard health economics practices, except instead of making you more confused, I'll explain what the numbers mean.

## How Money Works When You Stop Wasting It

### Cost Side (What You Spend)

You spend {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} convincing humans that not dying is preferable to dying. This covers:

- Global referendum campaign to get 280M votes ({{< var treaty_campaign_budget_referendum >}})
- Professional lobbyists, previously employed by defense contractors, now employed by pharmaceutical companies ({{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}})
- Super PAC papers that make politicians care about living voters ({{< var treaty_campaign_budget_super_pacs >}})

This is a one-time cost. You either achieve treaty passage or you don't.

### Benefit Side (What Appears From The Void)

The treaty redirects {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually from military spending to medical research. This money already exists. You're not printing new money or raising taxes. You're just moving existing money from weapons procurement to clinical trials.

This generates benefits through two mechanisms:

**1. You stop setting money on fire**

Military spending has economic multiplier effects of [0.5-1.0](../references.qmd#military-spending-economic-multiplier)×. That means for every dollar spent on bombs, you get 50 cents to a dollar of economic value. Medical research has multiplier effects of [2.0-3.0](../references.qmd#healthcare-investment-economic-multiplier)×. For every dollar spent curing diseases, you get $2-3 of economic value.



**2. You stop paying people to make trials cost {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} times too much**

Traditional FDA Phase 3 trials cost {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_fda_example_41k >}} {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_fda_example_41k_cite >}} per patient due to site setup costs, dedicated research staff, patient travel reimbursement, custom case report forms, and extensive monitoring requirements. The Oxford RECOVERY trial cost {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient by using existing hospital infrastructure, minimal additional data collection beyond standard care, and simplified consent processes.

That's an {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}x {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}} cost reduction from eliminating unnecessary overhead and using existing infrastructure.

## The Return on Investment Equation

{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only_latex >}}

In human language: "How much value do you get per dollar spent?"

**Conservative scenario** (only counting R&D efficiency, ignoring everything else):

{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only_latex >}}

You spend $1, you get ${{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}} back. This beats most legal activities.

**Complete scenario** (PRIMARY estimate including all core benefits):

{{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits_latex >}}

You spend $1 billion once, you get ${{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}} billion back every year in recurring benefits.

## Cost-Effectiveness: The "Per Life Saved" Metric

Health economists invented a metric called ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio) to measure cost-effectiveness:

**ICER = (Cost) / (Health Benefit in QALYs)**

Translation: "How much does it cost per year of healthy life created?"

WHO says interventions under {{< var who_qaly_threshold_cost_effective >}} {{< var who_qaly_threshold_cost_effective_cite >}} per QALY are "cost-effective." Most successful health programs cost [$3,000-10,000](../references.qmd#who-cost-effectiveness-threshold) per QALY.

This system's ICER: **{{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}} per DALY** (negative, meaning cost-dominant)

That's negative. Negative means you MAKE money while saving lives. Economists call this a "dominant intervention" because even they can't argue against it.

This approach doesn't cost money to save lives. Instead, it generates profit per life saved.

Traditional charity: "Please donate {{< var givewell_cost_per_life_avg >}} to save [one life](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)"
This approach: "We saved a life as a side effect of doing profitable things"

**Technical note**: This uses "net present value," which is economist code for "future money is worth less than current money" ({{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} discount rate).

## "But What If It Doesn't Pass?"

**Conditional on success**: {{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}} per DALY

**Expected value (10% success probability)**: {{< var treaty_expected_cost_per_daly_conservative >}} per DALY

{{< var treaty_expected_cost_per_daly_conservative_latex >}}

Even at pessimistic 1-in-10 odds, this remains {{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x more cost-effective than bed nets ({{< var bed_nets_cost_per_daly >}}/DALY) and comparable to deworming, the gold standard.

For context: [Ottawa Treaty](../references.qmd#icbl-ottawa-treaty) (landmine ban) was called a "bold gamble" that succeeded with [164 countries signing](../references.qmd#icbl-ottawa-treaty) (80%+ of world).

### The Detailed NPV Formulas (For Spreadsheet Enthusiasts)

For those who need to see the actual equations before believing anything:

#### NPV of Costs

{{< var dfda_npv_total_cost_latex >}}

where $C_{0}$ is upfront costs (platform development, legal structure, data integration), $C_{\text{op}}(t)$ is annual operating costs in year $t$ (maintenance, analysis, administration), $r$ is the discount rate ({{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}}), and $T$ is the time horizon ({{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years).

#### NPV of Benefits

**Note:** The NPV calculation includes **only annual recurring R&D savings**, not the one-time 8.2-year timeline shift in disease eradication. The timeline shift is a separate one-time benefit that occurs when the regulatory delay is eliminated (see [Regulatory Mortality Analysis](../appendix/regulatory-mortality-analysis.qmd)).

Annual benefits $S(t)$ are calculated as:
$$
S(t) = p(t)\alpha R_{d}
$$

where $p(t)$ is the adoption rate at year $t$ (gradual ramp-up over {{< var dfda_npv_adoption_ramp_years >}} years), $\alpha$ is the fraction of R&D costs saved ({{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} baseline), and $R_{d}$ is annual global clinical trial spending ({{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual >}} {{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual_cite >}}).

The NPV of benefits (R&D savings only):
{{< var dfda_npv_benefit_rd_only_latex >}}

#### Return on Investment

{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only_latex >}}

This yields the conservative estimate of {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI over {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years.

**Important distinction**: The NPV calculation above includes only annual recurring R&D savings. However, the QALY and ICER calculations below **do include** the one-time 8.2-year timeline shift in disease eradication, as this represents the primary health benefit from eliminating the regulatory delay (see [Regulatory Mortality Analysis](../appendix/regulatory-mortality-analysis.qmd)).

For the dFDA infrastructure's cost per health benefit averted (8.2-year timeline shift):

**Cost per DALY averted: {{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}}**

This represents {{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}} per year of healthy life gained. The negative ICER (cost-dominant intervention) indicates cost savings while improving health. Standard willingness-to-pay thresholds are {{< var who_qaly_threshold_cost_effective >}}-{{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}} {{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd_cite >}} per QALY; interventions that save costs while gaining QALYs are unconditionally recommended.

#### NPV of Regulatory Delay Avoidance

The conservative NPV above excludes the one-time benefit from eliminating the regulatory delay (8.2-year timeline shift in disease eradication). However, we can calculate the NPV of this benefit by modeling when it occurs.

**Assumption**: We assume diseases are cured 100 years in the future on average. If cures occur at year 100, eliminating the regulatory delay brings them 8.2 years earlier (years 92-100). This is a simple timeline shift - the full annual benefit applies for all 8.2 years. Far-future discounting dramatically reduces NPV compared to immediate benefits, but the delay avoidance still provides value.

The NPV of regulatory delay avoidance (assuming average cure time of 100 years):

Using the disease eradication delay benefit of {{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}}, applied across 8.2 years with future discounting at {{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}}.

This yields an NPV assuming cures occur 100 years in the future on average. The discount factor at year 92 (when benefits begin) is approximately (1 + {{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}})^92, making far-future benefits much smaller than if they occurred immediately.

**Calculation details**: The full annual benefit ({{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}}) applies for all 8.2 years (years 92-100), with each year's value discounted back to present. This represents the monetized value of 8.2 years of QALYs/DALYs that occur 100 years in the future, shifted 8.2 years earlier by eliminating the regulatory delay.

**Comparison**: The regulatory delay avoidance benefit ({{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}} annually) is substantially larger than the conservative R&D-only benefit ({{< var dfda_npv_benefit_rd_only >}}:1 ROI), demonstrating that health outcomes substantially exceed cost savings even with far-future discounting. Note: These are separate benefit streams; the delay avoidance benefit does not include R&D savings.

**Key insight**: Eliminating the regulatory delay still provides value even if cures are 100 years away on average, but far-future discounting means the NPV is much smaller. The actual value depends on when diseases are actually cured, which varies by disease category. Some may be cured in 10-20 years (moderate discounting), others in 50-100+ years (heavy discounting). The 100-year assumption is conservative for many diseases that may take decades to cure.

## Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) Valuation

QALYs represent the standard metric in health economics for comparing health interventions across different conditions and treatment modalities. One QALY equals one year of life in perfect health.

### QALY Calculation Model

The total annual QALY gain ({{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} QALYs baseline) derives from three distinct benefit streams:

**A. Accelerated Development of Existing Pipeline Drugs**

Health gains from bringing effective treatments to patients faster through shortened development and approval timelines:

- **Baseline:** Research shows treatment delays significantly increase cancer mortality, with studies indicating approximately [10%](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2020/every-month-delayed-cancer-treatment-can-raise-risk-death-around-10) increased risk per month of delay ([systematic review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33148535/))
- **Estimate:** 2-year average acceleration across pharmaceutical pipeline
- **Impact:** Significant contribution to the total {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} DALYs averted from the one-time timeline shift 

**B. Improved Preventative Care via Real-World Evidence**

Value of using comprehensive data to optimize preventative care and treatment effectiveness:

- **Baseline:** Cancer screenings alone have saved millions of life-years; significant untapped potential remains
- **Mechanism:** Large-scale identification of at-risk populations and real-world effectiveness measurement
- **Impact:** Contributes to the total {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} DALYs averted

**C. Enabling Research for Previously Untreatable Diseases**

Transformative potential to create viable research pathways for conditions ignored due to high trial costs:

- **Baseline:** {{< var rare_diseases_count_global >}} {{< var rare_diseases_count_global_cite >}}+ rare diseases, {{< var dfda_trial_completion_rate >}} lack FDA-approved treatments
- **Mechanism:** Radically lower per-patient costs make rare disease R&D economically feasible
- **Impact:** Major contributor to the total {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} DALYs averted

**QALY Valuation:** Standard economic valuations range from {{< var who_qaly_threshold_cost_effective >}}-{{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}} {{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd_cite >}} per QALY. This analysis uses conservative mid-range values.

For detailed DALY calculation methodology, see [Regulatory Mortality Analysis](../appendix/regulatory-mortality-analysis.qmd).

## Counterfactual Baseline Specification

This cost-effectiveness analysis uses the **status quo** as the baseline counterfactual: military spending continues at current levels ({{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}} annually) and is allocated to traditional military purposes. Under this baseline, the {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} redirected to medical research infrastructure would otherwise remain in military budgets.

**Alternative counterfactual scenarios** include:

1. **Military R&D continuation**: The {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} continues funding military research and development, potentially yielding civilian technology spillovers (e.g., GPS, internet protocols, materials science advances). This scenario is partially addressed in the peace dividend calculations, which acknowledge that military spending generates economic multiplier effects of 0.5-1.0× compared to medical research multipliers of 2.0-3.0×.

2. **Return to taxpayers**: Funds are returned via tax cuts, enabling private consumption and investment. Under this scenario, the opportunity cost equals the weighted average return on private capital (approximately {{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} annually in developed economies).

3. **Alternative government priorities**: Reallocation to other public investments such as infrastructure, education, or climate mitigation. Each alternative use would require separate cost-benefit analysis to determine relative efficiency.

**Methodological note on baseline selection**: The economically rigorous baseline is the "next best alternative use" rather than "status quo continuation." However, identifying the single next-best alternative requires comprehensive comparison across all possible uses of public funds, which exceeds the scope of this analysis. This analysis therefore focuses on the **conditional benefits of dFDA reallocation**: the health and economic gains achievable by redirecting {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} from military to medical research infrastructure.

**Conservative interpretation**: Even if alternative uses generate positive economic value, the dFDA infrastructure exhibits **dominant intervention** characteristics (cost-dominant: {{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}} per DALY), indicating it saves costs while improving health outcomes. Under standard cost-effectiveness frameworks, dominant interventions are unconditionally recommended regardless of alternative uses, as they represent free gains in both dimensions (reduced costs and improved health).

## Peace Dividend Calculation Methodology

The peace dividend represents economic benefits from reduced military spending. The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty redirects {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military spending ({{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}} in 2024) = {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually.

### Economic benefits of reduced military spending

1. **Direct fiscal savings:** {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} available for productive investment
2. **Reduced conflict-related economic damage:** Historical analysis shows military spending reductions correlate with decreased trade disruption, infrastructure destruction, and refugee costs

**Conservative estimate:** Analysis uses {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} annual peace dividend based on World Bank and IMF frameworks for economic benefits of reduced military expenditure.

For detailed calculations, see [Peace Dividend Analysis](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd).

**Confidence level separation**: The peace dividend calculation separates into two components with different levels of causal confidence:

1. **Direct fiscal savings (high confidence)**: {{< var peace_dividend_direct_fiscal_savings >}} - The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} reduction in military budgets ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}) represents direct fiscal savings with high certainty. These funds are immediately available for reallocation regardless of conflict reduction effects.

2. **Conflict reduction benefits (lower confidence)**: {{< var peace_dividend_conflict_reduction >}} - The remaining {{< var peace_dividend_conflict_reduction >}} assumes that {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} less military spending correlates with {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} reduction in conflict costs (direct: {{< var global_annual_war_direct_costs_total >}}, indirect: {{< var global_annual_war_indirect_costs_total >}}). This proportional relationship is a simplifying assumption without established causal evidence.

**Conservative interpretation**: The direct fiscal savings ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually) are certain; conflict reduction benefits ($0 to {{< var peace_dividend_conflict_reduction >}}) are uncertain and represent an optimistic scenario. The analysis uses the full {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} in optimistic/complete cases but acknowledges this may overstate benefits if the causal link between military spending and conflict is weaker than linear.

**Causal mechanism uncertainty**: The relationship between military spending and conflict is complex. Factors include deterrence effects (military strength may prevent conflicts), alliance structures, economic interdependence, and geopolitical stability. A 1% spending reduction may yield anywhere from 0% to >1% conflict reduction depending on context. Without instrumental variables or difference-in-differences analysis, the causal claim remains speculative.

## Research Acceleration Mechanism

The {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× research acceleration multiplier comes from the combination of multiple proven accelerators:

**Faster Recruitment**: The Oxford RECOVERY trial recruited {{< var traditional_large_trial_size >}} {{< var traditional_large_trial_size_cite >}} patients in 3 weeks, compared to 6-18 months for 100 patients in traditional trials. This speed comes from pragmatic eligibility (50% of patients qualify vs. 2% traditionally) and embedded recruitment in routine care.

**Faster Completion**: Pragmatic trials complete in 3-12 months instead of 3-5 years because patient subsidies flip economic incentives. Physicians gain revenue from trial participation rather than losing it, eliminating the perverse incentives that delay traditional trials.

**Massive Parallelization**: With {{< var dfda_active_trials >}} trials running simultaneously (vs. {{< var current_active_trials >}} {{< var current_active_trials_cite >}} today), the system achieves 20× more concurrent research. Universal patient participation makes this possible, as every doctor's office becomes a trial site.

**Higher Completion Rates**: {{< var dfda_trial_completion_rate >}} of pragmatic trials complete (vs. {{< var current_trial_abandonment_rate >}} {{< var current_trial_abandonment_rate_cite >}} abandonment rate today) because patients are subsidized and physicians profit from participation.

**Increased Funding**: The 1% Treaty adds {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} to the current {{< var global_med_research_spending >}} {{< var global_med_research_spending_cite >}} baseline, increasing total research funding to {{< var total_research_funding_with_treaty >}} (1.4× increase).

These improvements compound multiplicatively to produce the {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× acceleration used in this analysis. This is a conservative estimate accounting for implementation constraints, regulatory requirements, and gradual adoption.

For detailed derivation, see [Research Acceleration Model](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd).

**Automated infrastructure, not researcher scaling**: The dFDA system operates as automated infrastructure analyzing time-series EHR data from electronic health records, wearables, and apps, similar to how Amazon provides infrastructure for e-commerce or Consumer Reports for product testing. The {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× research acceleration does **not** require {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× more researchers because the system scales through software and data infrastructure, not human labor.

The platform uses federated queries (data stays in Epic/Cerner/Apple Health systems) rather than centralized databases, enabling analysis without data movement. Physicians continue normal clinical practice; the platform automatically detects patterns, identifies treatment effects, and flags signals for peer review. This is fundamentally different from traditional research models that scale linearly with researcher headcount.

## Sensitivity Analysis Approach

The analysis employs comprehensive sensitivity testing across multiple scenarios to assess robustness of findings:

**Conservative Scenario ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI):**

- R&D cost reduction: {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}}
- QALY gains: {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} annually
- Adoption timeline: {{< var dfda_npv_adoption_ramp_years >}} years to full adoption
- Includes only R&D efficiency savings (excludes peace dividend and six additional benefit categories)

### Worst-Case Scenario ({{< var treaty_conservative_scenario_roi >}}:1 ROI)

- Benefits half as good as baseline
- Costs twice as high as baseline
- Extended adoption timeline
- Regulatory barriers and implementation delays

**Optimistic Scenario ({{< var treaty_optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 ROI):**

- R&D cost reduction: {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} (RECOVERY trial-like efficiency)
- QALY gains: {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} annually
- Faster adoption and broader scope

**Complete Case ({{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 ROI):**

- Includes all eight quantifiable benefit categories
- Peace dividend: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}
- Earlier treatment access, research acceleration, rare disease treatments, drug price reductions, prevention medicine, mental health benefits

Sensitivity analysis demonstrates robust returns across all scenarios, with ROI ranging from {{< var treaty_conservative_scenario_roi >}}:1 (worst-case) to {{< var treaty_optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 (optimistic). See [1% Treaty Cost-Effectiveness Analysis](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) for detailed scenario modeling.

**Probabilistic sensitivity analysis:** Instead of just testing a few scenarios (worst-case, conservative, optimistic), we ran 10,000 simulations where each uncertain parameter was randomly sampled from probability distributions. This tells us not just "what if X happens" but "what's the range of likely outcomes given all the uncertainty."

**What we varied:** Cost reduction (50-95%), political success probability (5-60%), adoption timeline (3-8 years), discount rate (1-7%), and QALY gains (0.7-1.3× baseline).

#### Results

- **If implementation succeeds** (conditional ROI): 95% of simulations fall between {{< var treaty_complete_roi_conditional_5th_percentile >}}:1 and {{< var treaty_complete_roi_conditional_95th_percentile >}}:1 ROI, with median {{< var treaty_complete_roi_conditional_median >}}:1. This means even with all the uncertainty, if the treaty passes, returns are almost certainly between {{< var treaty_complete_roi_conditional_5th_percentile >}}:1 and {{< var treaty_complete_roi_conditional_95th_percentile >}}:1.
- **Accounting for political risk** (expected ROI): 95% of simulations fall between {{< var treaty_complete_roi_expected_5th_percentile >}}:1 and {{< var treaty_complete_roi_expected_95th_percentile >}}:1 ROI, with median {{< var treaty_complete_roi_expected_median >}}:1. This incorporates the probability that the treaty might not pass, even with that risk, expected returns are still {{< var treaty_complete_roi_expected_5th_percentile >}}:1 to {{< var treaty_complete_roi_expected_95th_percentile >}}:1.

**Economic interpretation:** ROI > 1:1 means benefits exceed costs. All 10,000 simulations produced ROI > 1:1, meaning there is zero probability (within the modeled uncertainty) that this intervention loses money. Even the worst-case scenario (5th percentile expected ROI of {{< var treaty_complete_roi_expected_5th_percentile >}}:1) generates {{< var treaty_complete_roi_expected_5th_percentile >}}× more value than cost. This qualifies as a **dominant intervention** in health economics: it should be implemented regardless of budget constraints, as it generates net economic surplus while improving health outcomes.

This probabilistic analysis complements the scenario-based sensitivity analysis above, providing confidence intervals rather than point estimates.

{{< include ../figures/monte-carlo-roi-distribution-chart.qmd >}}

### Discount Rate Sensitivity

The baseline analysis uses a {{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} annual discount rate (standard for long-term public health investments). NPV calculations are sensitive to this critical parameter:

**ROI sensitivity to discount rate**:

| Discount Rate | ROI (dFDA Only) | Interpretation |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **1%** | {{< var roi_discount_1pct >}}:1 | Low discount rate (very long-term view) |
| **3% (baseline)** | {{< var roi_discount_3pct >}}:1 | Standard public health discount rate |
| **5%** | {{< var roi_discount_5pct >}}:1 | Higher discount rate (private sector typical) |
| **7%** | {{< var roi_discount_7pct >}}:1 | High discount rate (short-term focus) |

**Formula**: Higher discount rates reduce NPV of future benefits:

{{< var dfda_npv_net_benefit_rd_only_latex >}}

where $r$ is the discount rate, $B_t$ are benefits in year $t$, and $C_t$ are costs in year $t$.

**Key insight**: Even at 7% discount rate (high by public health standards), ROI remains {{< var roi_discount_7pct >}}:1, substantially exceeding alternative interventions. The {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}}-year horizon captures the majority of NPV; benefits continue beyond year {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} but are discounted heavily.

**Benefit timing**: Peace dividend is immediate (year 1), R&D savings ramp gradually (years 1-5), QALY gains are long-term (years 5-20+). Front-loaded benefits (peace dividend) are less sensitive to discount rate than back-loaded benefits (QALYs).

## Key Analytical Assumptions

This analysis rests on several core assumptions that should be made explicit for academic transparency:

### Strategic Stability Assumption

**Assumption:** A coordinated {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} reduction in military spending across all nations maintains relative power balances and strategic deterrence capabilities.

**Justification:** The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty explicitly requires proportional reductions from all signatories. Since relative military capabilities remain unchanged, strategic stability is preserved. Historical analysis shows that symmetric reductions in military tensions (e.g., START treaties, naval treaties between world wars) maintained deterrence while reducing absolute expenditure.

**Sensitivity:** This assumption is critical to the peace dividend calculation. Alternative scenarios modeling unilateral reductions would require different political economy frameworks.

### Linear Scaling Assumption

**Assumption:** Economic benefits and costs scale approximately linearly with program scope and adoption rates.

**Justification:** Conservative assumption that costs scale with system usage. Research acceleration benefits may exhibit superlinear returns (network effects, data abundance), making this assumption conservative.

**Sensitivity:** Tested through worst-case ({{< var treaty_conservative_scenario_roi >}}:1 ROI) and optimistic ({{< var treaty_optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 ROI) scenarios spanning benefits 50% lower to 5× higher than baseline.

### Adoption Rate Assumptions

**Assumption:** dFDA achieves gradual adoption following a {{< var dfda_npv_adoption_ramp_years >}}-year linear ramp to 50%-80% participation rate among eligible trials.

**Conservative case:** 50% of trials adopt dFDA methodology
**Optimistic case:** 80% adoption rate

**Justification:** Based on historical adoption curves for electronic health records (5-10 years to majority adoption), clinical trial registry systems, and FDA Sentinel System implementation.

**Adoption realism considerations:** Technology adoption typically follows S-curve dynamics with critical mass thresholds rather than linear ramps. Coordination failure risk exists (prisoner's dilemma: pharmaceutical companies may prefer others adopt first). Mitigation: Economic incentives ({{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}× cost reduction) create overwhelming financial motivation for early adoption. Regulatory harmonization across jurisdictions may extend to 10-20 years rather than the modeled 5-year timeline, though pilot programs in willing jurisdictions (UK MHRA, which accepted RECOVERY evidence) can establish proof-of-concept earlier.

**Sensitivity:** NPV calculations explicitly model adoption uncertainty through gradual ramp-up rather than immediate full adoption. Conservative scenario (50% adoption) accounts for coordination failures and regulatory delays.

### Cost Reduction Assumptions

**Assumption:** dFDA methodology reduces per-patient trial costs by {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} (conservative) to 95% (optimistic) compared to traditional randomized controlled trials.

#### Empirical basis

- Oxford RECOVERY trial: {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}}× cost reduction ({{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient vs. {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_cite >}} traditional)
- ADAPTABLE trial: Similar cost structure using pragmatic design
- Literature on pragmatic trials consistently shows 50-95% cost reductions

**Sensitivity:** Conservative scenario ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI) uses {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} reduction; optimistic case uses 95%.

### Historical Precedent: Pre-1962 Physician-Led Efficacy Trials

**Context:** The decentralized FDA approach is not an untested innovation extrapolated from a single case study (RECOVERY trial). Rather, it represents a return to the physician-led, real-world evidence model that operated successfully from 1883 to 1960 before being replaced by the current centralized system.

**Cost structure comparison demonstrates dramatic efficiency difference:**

- **Pre-1962 system**: {{< var pre_1962_drug_development_cost >}} {{< var pre_1962_drug_development_cost_cite >}} per drug (2024 inflation-adjusted) for safety testing; efficacy determined through decentralized physician case reports
- **Post-1962 system**: [$2.6 billion](../references.qmd#drug-development-cost) per drug average, a **{{< var drug_cost_increase_pre1962_to_current_multiplier >}}× cost increase**; drug companies conduct both safety and efficacy trials internally
- **dFDA model**: Return to decentralized physician-led efficacy testing with modern automation (electronic health records, AI-assisted analysis, real-time data aggregation), targeting **50-95% cost reductions**

![Drug development costs exploded after 1962 regulations](../../assets/cost-to-develop-a-new-drug.png)

The cost explosion began exactly when efficacy testing was centralized within pharmaceutical companies. This wasn't a natural evolution of drug development - it was a regulatory mandate that increased costs {{< var drug_cost_increase_pre1962_to_current_multiplier >}}-fold while slowing innovation.

#### Historical operational model

From 1883 to 1960, {{< var pre_1962_physician_count >}} physicians across America tested drug efficacy on real patients in routine clinical practice. The [Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)](../references.qmd#jama-founded-1893) compiled these observational reports, leading medical experts peer-reviewed the aggregated data, and effective treatments received endorsement. This decentralized, pragmatic trial system coincided with dramatic improvements in life expectancy during the early-to-mid 20th century.

![Life expectancy was flat for 10,000 years, then exploded starting in 1883](../../assets/life-expectancy-historical.jpg)

Human life expectancy remained essentially unchanged from the Bronze Age through 1883. Then something unprecedented happened: organized medical research began, physicians started systematically testing treatments, and life expectancy doubled within {{< var pre_1962_validation_years >}} years. This dramatic acceleration occurred under the decentralized physician-led model (1883-1960), not the centralized pharmaceutical trial system that replaced it after 1962.

**Safety record, the thalidomide success story:** Critically, the pre-1962 safety testing framework successfully prevented the [thalidomide disaster](../references.qmd#thalidomide-no-us-birth-defects) that devastated Europe with [thousands of horrific birth defects](../references.qmd#thalidomide-birth-defects). When thalidomide was marketed in Europe starting in 1957 for morning sickness, existing FDA safety regulations (1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) blocked the drug from approval in the United States. **Zero American babies were harmed**, the safety testing framework worked exactly as intended.

The 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendment added extensive efficacy requirements *in response to thalidomide*, despite the fact that the US had already been fully protected by existing safety regulations. The problem was not insufficient regulation, safety testing had succeeded. The response was to take efficacy testing away from {{< var pre_1962_physician_count >}} independent physicians and centralize it within pharmaceutical companies, increasing costs {{< var drug_cost_increase_pre1962_to_current_multiplier >}}-fold while slowing approvals substantially.

**Current system deterioration:** Life expectancy in the United States has declined in recent years (2014-2017, 2020-2021), the first sustained decreases since 1915-1918, suggesting the post-1962 regulatory model may have reached diminishing or negative returns.

#### Implications for generalizability

The RECOVERY trial ({{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient) demonstrates that modern infrastructure enables even greater efficiency than the pre-1962 system. However, the fundamental approach, physicians testing treatments on real patients in clinical practice settings, has {{< var pre_1962_validation_years >}} years of empirical validation (1883-1960), not merely one case study.

The cost reduction estimates (50-95%) are conservative relative to historical costs. 1980s drugs cost approximately {{< var drug_development_cost_1980s >}} [(compounded, 1990 dollars)](../references.qmd#pre-1962-drug-costs-timeline) compared to modern {{< var pharma_drug_development_cost_current >}} [costs](../references.qmd#pre-1962-drug-costs-timeline), representing a {{< var drug_cost_increase_1980s_to_current_multiplier >}}-fold increase. Modern technology (EHRs, wearables, automated data collection) suggests efficiency gains could exceed historical precedent while maintaining the safety protections that successfully prevented disasters like thalidomide.

### Political Feasibility Assumption

**Assumption:** The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty achieves ratification by sufficient nations within a 3-5 year campaign timeline.

**Justification:** Historical treaty adoption timelines vary (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: 3 years; Paris Climate Agreement: 5 years). This analysis focuses on economic value *conditional* on implementation, not probability of political success.

**Important caveat:** This analysis does not model the probability distribution over political outcomes. The economic case ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 to {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 ROI) holds *if implemented*, but political economy barriers to implementation are substantial and outside the scope of this cost-benefit analysis.

### Expected Value Analysis Accounting for Political Risk

**Standard economic practice**: Cost-benefit analysis for interventions with implementation uncertainty requires expected value calculation:

{{< var dfda_expected_roi_10pct_political_success_latex >}}

The preceding analysis presents *conditional* benefits (returns IF implementation succeeds). Expected value analysis incorporates the probability of achieving political ratification and sustained commitment:

**Expected ROI sensitivity to political success probability**:

{{< include ../figures/expected-roi-political-probability-column-chart.qmd >}}

| Political Success Probability | Expected ROI (dFDA Only) | Interpretation |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **10% (Conservative)** | {{< var dfda_expected_roi_10pct_political_success >}}:1 | Low confidence in treaty ratification |
| **25% (Moderate)** | {{< var dfda_expected_roi_25pct_political_success >}}:1 | Historical treaty adoption baseline |
| **40% (Moderate-High)** | {{< var dfda_expected_roi_40pct_political_success >}}:1 | Favorable political conditions |
| **50% (Optimistic)** | {{< var dfda_expected_roi_50pct_political_success >}}:1 | Strong international coordination |

**Key insight**: Even with conservative 10% success probability, expected ROI of {{< var dfda_expected_roi_10pct_political_success >}}:1 substantially exceeds typical public health interventions (which have P≈1.0 but ROI of 10-30:1).

**Comparison to traditional interventions** (assuming 100% implementation probability):

- Childhood vaccination programs: {{< var childhood_vaccination_roi >}} {{< var childhood_vaccination_roi_cite >}}:1 ROI with P≈1.0
- Against Malaria Foundation: ~8:1 equivalent ROI
- **1% Treaty (P=10%)**: {{< var dfda_expected_roi_10pct_political_success >}}:1 expected ROI
- **1% Treaty (P=25%)**: {{< var dfda_expected_roi_25pct_political_success >}}:1 expected ROI

**Interpretation**: The high conditional ROI ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1) means that even modest implementation probabilities yield expected values competitive with best-in-class health interventions that have near-certain implementation.

**Note**: This analysis uses point estimates for political probability. Actual probability depends on campaign execution, geopolitical conditions, and public support mobilization. The [campaign strategy](campaign-budget.qmd) allocates {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} over 4 years specifically to maximize ratification probability.

### Time Inconsistency and Commitment Credibility

**Political economy challenge**: Even if the treaty achieves initial ratification, sustained commitment over the {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}}-year analytical horizon faces time inconsistency problems. Political business cycles (2-6 year terms) create incentives to raid the medical research budget for short-term priorities.

**Concentrated costs, diffuse benefits**: Defense contractors have concentrated interests with substantial lobbying capacity ({{< var defense_lobbying_annual >}} {{< var defense_lobbying_annual_cite >}} annually). Health benefits, while larger in aggregate ({{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} annually), are diffuse across millions of beneficiaries. Olson's logic of collective action predicts that concentrated interests will resist more effectively than diffuse beneficiaries will mobilize, creating political economy barriers to sustained implementation.

**Historical precedent - Post-WWII peace dividend**: The post-World War II "peace dividend" saw [military spending fall from 41% of GDP (1945) to 7.2% (1948)](../references.qmd#us-post-wwii-military-spending-cut), with expectations of permanent reductions. However, the Cold War reversed this within 3 years. Military spending returned to 15% of GDP by 1953. Similar patterns occurred post-Vietnam and post-Cold War: initial reductions followed by reversals within 5-10 years.

**Treaty ratification ≠ sustained funding**: The Paris Climate Agreement provides a cautionary example: 196 parties ratified, but many failed to meet funding commitments. As of 2024, developed countries have not met the $100B annual climate finance pledge despite treaty obligations. Treaty ratification creates moral commitment but weak enforcement mechanisms for sustained budgetary allocations.

**Implication for expected value**: The political success probabilities used in expected value analysis (10%-50%) implicitly incorporate time inconsistency risk. A treaty might ratify with P=50% but maintain funding for {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years with P=25%. The expected value analysis partially addresses this through probability discounting, but time inconsistency (commitment erosion over time) represents an additional risk factor beyond initial political feasibility.

**Potential commitment mechanisms** (not modeled):

- Constitutional amendment (very high barrier, very high credibility)
- Independent funding agency with statutory protections
- Lock-box mechanism with supermajority requirement to redirect funds
- International monitoring and reputation costs
- Public transparency: all spending and trial outcomes publicly auditable

**Note**: The analysis acknowledges this limitation. Results should be interpreted as conditional on sustained implementation, with expected value analysis providing probability-adjusted estimates that partially account for political risk.

### Technology Constancy Assumption

**Assumption:** Analysis does not incorporate potential advances in AI, automation, or biotechnology that could further accelerate research.

**Justification:** Conservative assumption. Emerging AI capabilities in drug discovery, automated synthesis, and computational biology could dramatically increase research productivity beyond modeled estimates.

**Implication:** Baseline estimates likely underestimate long-term benefits by excluding technology-driven accelerations.

### Data Quality and Availability

All primary data sources are documented in [References](../references.qmd) with confidence levels:

- **High confidence** (78%): SIPRI military expenditure, WHO mortality statistics, ClinicalTrials.gov data
- **Medium confidence** (17%): Peace dividend estimates, QALY valuations (wide range in literature)
- **Conservative bounds**: Where uncertainty exists, analysis uses conservative estimates favoring underestimation of benefits

For complete parameter documentation with confidence indicators and peer-review status, see [Parameters and Calculations Reference](../appendix/parameters-and-calculations.qmd).


## The Conservative Case: dFDA Only

{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI

This is the floor. The "what if we're wrong about everything" scenario.

Count only R&D savings from cheaper trials. Ignore peace dividends, earlier drug access, and everything else that makes skeptics nervous.

### The Math

Simple ROI calculation:

{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only_latex >}}

You spend {{< var dfda_npv_total_cost >}}.
You get back {{< var dfda_npv_net_benefit_rd_only >}} over {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years.

That's ${{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}} appearing for every $1 you invest. It's like a money printer, except instead of causing inflation, it causes people to continue existing.

**Technical note**: This uses "net present value," which is economist code for "future money is worth less than current money" ({{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} discount rate). The NPV calculation includes **only annual recurring R&D savings** over {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years, not the one-time 8.2-year timeline shift in disease eradication (which is a separate benefit). If you're into spreadsheets: [full NPV methodology here](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#calculation-framework---npv-methodology).

### Where the Money Comes From

{{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military budgets gets redirected. This gives you:

- **Funding**: {{< var global_annual_human_cost_state_violence >}}/year to spend on not-dying
- **Bonus savings**: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/year in economic value from building {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} fewer things that explode

The peace dividend math is simple: wars cost {{< var global_annual_war_total_cost >}}/year. {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} less war costs {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} less money.

{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit_latex >}}

| Cost Category | Annual Amount | Components |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **Direct Military Spending** | {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}} | SIPRI 2024 global military budgets [(source)](../references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending) |
| **[Infrastructure Destruction](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var global_annual_infrastructure_destruction_conflict >}} | Transportation, energy, communications, water, education, healthcare facilities |
| **Human Life Losses** | {{< var global_annual_human_life_losses_conflict >}} | {{< var global_annual_conflict_deaths_total >}} conflict deaths × {{< var value_of_statistical_life >}} {{< var value_of_statistical_life_cite >}} value of statistical life (conservative estimate) |
| **[Trade Disruption](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var global_annual_trade_disruption_conflict >}} | Shipping, supply chains, energy prices, currency volatility |
| **[Lost Economic Growth](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var global_annual_lost_economic_growth_military_spending >}} {{< var global_annual_lost_economic_growth_military_spending_cite >}} | Opportunity cost of military spending vs. productive investment |
| **[Veteran Healthcare](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var sensitivity_peace_dividend_optimistic >}} | Long-term medical care for conflict-related injuries |
| **Refugee Support** | {{< var global_annual_refugee_support_costs >}} {{< var global_annual_refugee_support_costs_cite >}} | [108.4M displaced persons](../references.qmd#unhcr-forcibly-displaced-2023) × [$1,384/year](../references.qmd#unhcr-refugee-support-cost) |
| **[Environmental Damage](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var global_annual_environmental_damage_conflict >}} {{< var global_annual_environmental_damage_conflict_cite >}} | Environmental destruction, toxic contamination, restoration costs |
| **[Psychological Impact](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var global_annual_psychological_impact_costs_conflict >}} {{< var global_annual_psychological_impact_costs_conflict_cite >}} | PTSD treatment, mental health services, productivity loss |
| **[Lost Human Capital](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var global_annual_lost_human_capital_conflict >}} {{< var global_annual_lost_human_capital_conflict_cite >}} | Productive capacity lost from casualties and displacement |
| **Total War Costs** | **{{< var global_annual_war_total_cost >}}** | Combined direct and indirect annual costs |
| **{{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Reduction** | **{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}** | Peace dividend from {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} treaty implementation |

This calculation methodology follows standard cost-of-conflict analysis frameworks used by the World Bank, IMF, and academic conflict economics research. See [Peace Dividend Calculations](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) for detailed sources and methodology.

**Note on confidence levels**: The direct military spending reduction ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}) has high confidence. The remaining conflict cost reductions assume proportional scaling (1% military spending → 1% conflict reduction) which lacks empirical validation. Conservative scenarios should use only direct fiscal savings; optimistic scenarios can include full peace dividend effects.

{{< include ../figures/peace-dividend-breakdown-bar-chart.qmd >}}

### How Treaty Funding Is Allocated

**Total annual treaty funding**: {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}

The vast majority goes to **patient subsidies** ({{< var dih_treasury_to_medical_research_annual >}}), with minimal overhead:

1. **Patient Trial Subsidies** ({{< var dih_treasury_trial_subsidies_pct >}}): {{< var dih_treasury_trial_subsidies_annual >}}/year
   - Subsidizes {{< var dih_patients_fundable_annually >}} patients annually at {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient
   - Patients bring subsidies to trials; providers collect payment when patients enroll
   - Makes trial participation profitable for providers instead of costly

2. **Victory Bond Payouts** ({{< var victory_bond_funding_pct >}}): {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year to campaign investors

3. **Coordination Platform** ({{< var dfda_opex_pct_of_treaty_funding >}}): {{< var dfda_annual_opex >}}/year for decentralized FDA infrastructure

**Why platform costs are low:** Decentralized FDA infrastructure provides coordination protocols (like HTTP for the internet), not a competing platform.

The infrastructure already exists. Epic, Cerner, Medable, Science 37 have built the components. A decentralized FDA protocol creates the coordination layer that makes them work together for clinical trials.

Data stays federated (in Epic/Cerner/Apple Health systems). No massive centralized database. No billion-dollar infrastructure. Just coordination protocols.

For detailed cost breakdown: [Platform Costs](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#dfda-platform-costs-rom-estimates-partnership-model).

**Key insight**: {{< var dih_treasury_medical_research_pct >}} of treaty funding goes directly to medical research (patients and providers as trial participation subsidies). Platform overhead is minimal ({{< var dfda_annual_opex >}}) compared to patient subsidies ({{< var dih_treasury_trial_subsidies_annual >}}).

This assumes gradual rollout (0% to 100% adoption over {{< var dfda_npv_adoption_ramp_years >}} years). Full breakdown: [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#dfda-platform-costs-rom-estimates-partnership-model).

### What You Get Back

- **Money**: {{< var dfda_npv_net_benefit_rd_only >}} in R&D savings ({{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years)
- **Returns**: {{< var dfda_npv_net_benefit_rd_only >}} ÷ {{< var dfda_npv_total_cost >}} = **{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1** ([full analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd))
- **Not dying**: {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} quality-adjusted life years annually

**Two money fountains from one budget shift**:

1. **Peace dividend**: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/year (from building {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} fewer things that explode)
2. **Research efficiency**: {{< var dfda_rd_gross_savings_annual >}}/year (from not requiring PhDs to document paperwork about paperwork for {{< var treatment_acceleration_years_current >}} {{< var treatment_acceleration_years_current_cite >}} years)

**Combined**: {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}}/year

The conservative case excludes faster drug access, better treatment selection, reduced adverse events, and the eight additional benefits quantified in the complete case.

**Worst-case check**: If costs double and benefits halve (everything goes catastrophically wrong), you still get {{< var treaty_conservative_scenario_roi >}}:1 to {{< var treaty_optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 returns. [Full sensitivity analysis](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd).

{{< include ../figures/dfda-roi-sensitivity-analysis-column-chart.qmd >}}

### Cost-Effectiveness: Dominant Health Intervention

Most health interventions require ongoing funding. This one generates profit while saving lives.

In health economics, that's called a **dominant intervention** - simultaneously reducing costs while improving health outcomes. Smallpox eradication is the historical precedent.

#### Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)

ICER measures how much you pay per year of healthy life gained (QALY):

**ICER = (Intervention Cost) / (QALYs Gained)**

For the dFDA (using the 8.2-year timeline shift):

**Cost per DALY: {{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}}** (negative = cost-dominant)

**Translation:** The intervention saves money while saving lives. Cost-dominant interventions are rare.

Normally, you *spend* money to save lives. Good interventions cost {{< var who_qaly_threshold_cost_effective >}}-{{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}} per QALY. Great interventions cost $3,000-{{< var who_qaly_threshold_cost_effective >}}.

This one is cost-dominant ({{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}} per DALY), meaning it saves money while saving lives.

It's backwards. The number is negative. Economists call this "dominant" because you don't have to choose between "saving money" and "saving lives." You do both.

**For comprehensive ICER analysis including sensitivity analysis across multiple scenarios, alternative funding perspectives, and detailed methodology**, see [dFDA ICER Analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#dfda-icer-analysis---cost-utility-framework).

#### Comparative Cost-Effectiveness vs. GiveWell Top Charities

The standard metric for comparing health interventions is **cost per DALY** (Disability-Adjusted Life Year) - how much you pay to save one year of healthy life.

**GiveWell Top Charities (Gold Standard for Cost-Effectiveness):**

- **[Bed Nets](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)**: {{< var bed_nets_cost_per_daly >}}/DALY (Against Malaria Foundation)
- **[Deworming](../references.qmd#deworming-cost-per-daly)**: {{< var deworming_cost_per_daly >}}/DALY (Deworm the World Initiative)
- **[Vitamin A Supplementation](../references.qmd#vitamin-a-cost-per-daly)**: {{< var vitamin_a_cost_per_daly >}}/DALY (Helen Keller International)

**1% Treaty/dFDA System:**

- **Conditional on success**: {{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}}/DALY ({{< var treaty_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}× more cost-effective than bed nets)

{{< var treaty_vs_bed_nets_multiplier_latex >}}

- **Expected value at 10% success probability**: {{< var treaty_expected_cost_per_daly_conservative >}}/DALY (still {{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}× better than bed nets)

{{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier_latex >}}

**Translation:** Even assuming only a 1-in-10 chance of political success, the 1% Treaty campaign is {{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}× more cost-effective than distributing bed nets, while also being self-funding (generates {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} in annual economic benefits).

The negative cost (net benefit) per life saved distinguishes this as a **dominant intervention** in health economics terminology, an intervention that both reduces costs and improves outcomes, with no trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness.

### Self-Funding Mechanism Through Military Budget Redirection

{{< include ../figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

{{< include ../figures/public-health-interventions-economic-benefit-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty financing structure creates a self-funding system requiring zero net new spending from donors or taxpayers.

**Economic Structure** ([see detailed calculation](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)):

- **Funding Source**: {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually from {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} [redirection of existing military budgets](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) (money already allocated in national budgets)

**Funding Allocation**:

1. **Victory Bond Payouts**: {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year to investors who funded the campaign
2. **dFDA Platform Operations**: {{< var dfda_annual_opex >}}/year for core infrastructure
3. **Patient Trial Subsidies**: {{< var dih_treasury_trial_subsidies_annual >}}/year subsidizing patient participation in clinical trials
   - At {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient ([RECOVERY trial cost](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd)), this funds {{< var dih_patients_fundable_annually >}} patients annually
   - Patients choose which trials to join; trials that attract patients get funded
   - **ALL remaining funds go to patient subsidies** - no separate bureaucracy or overhead budget

- **Annual Benefits**: {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} (Peace dividend: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} + R&D savings: {{< var dfda_rd_gross_savings_annual >}})
- **Operating Costs**: {{< var treaty_total_annual_costs >}} annually (campaign operations and dFDA infrastructure)
- **Net Position**: {{< var treaty_peace_plus_rd_annual_benefits >}} annual surplus after all costs
- **Lives Saved**: {{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} annually
- **Cost per Life Saved**: Net societal benefit per life ([negative cost](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) indicates net profit, meaning the system generates economic value while saving lives)

This financing structure classifies the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty as a **dominant health intervention** using standard health economics terminology, an intervention with both lower costs and better health outcomes than the status quo, requiring no trade-off between cost-effectiveness and impact.

The self-funding nature eliminates traditional barriers to scale, as the intervention generates sufficient economic surplus to sustain and expand operations without ongoing charitable contributions.

## The Complete Case: All Direct Benefits

{{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 ROI

The conservative {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 case counted only R&D efficiency gains.

Now let's include all eight quantifiable benefit categories.

### Annual Recurring Benefits Breakdown

{{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual >}} in **recurring annual benefits** (perpetual)

Core recurring benefit streams:

1. **Peace dividend** ({{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}) - Building {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} fewer things that explode
2. **R&D cost savings** ({{< var dfda_rd_gross_savings_annual >}}) - Trials cost {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}}× less

#### Total recurring annual benefits

{{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual_latex >}}

That's **{{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual >}} per year** (recurring perpetually).

**Important Note:** Regulatory delay elimination provides a **one-time 8.2-year timeline shift** forward in curing diseases, not an annual recurring benefit. This one-time benefit is massive ({{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}} total economic value from timeline shift) but occurs once when the delay is eliminated, not every year. The recurring annual benefits above ($155.1B/year) represent only the peace dividend and R&D savings, which continue perpetually. See [Regulatory Mortality Analysis](../appendix/regulatory-mortality-analysis.qmd) for the one-time timeline shift methodology.

#### Complete Case ROI

{{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits_latex >}}

**Translation:** Every $1 invested returns ${{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}} in **recurring annual benefits** (peace dividend + R&D savings), plus a one-time 8.2-year timeline shift in disease eradication (not included in annual figure).

These estimates derive from:

- Proven trial costs ([RECOVERY](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd): {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}× cost reduction demonstrated)
- Disease prevalence data (WHO Global Health Observatory)
- Standard QALY valuations (health economics consensus thresholds)

**Critical distinction** - the two benefit categories are different things:

| Benefit Category | Type | Value | Frequency | Description |
|:---|:---:|---:|:---|:---|
| **Timeline Shift** | One-time | {{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}} | Once | Eliminating {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}}-year regulatory delay shifts disease eradication {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}} years earlier. Saves {{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} lives and {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} DALYs. See [Regulatory Mortality Analysis](../appendix/regulatory-mortality-analysis.qmd) |
| **Peace Dividend** | Recurring | {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/year | Perpetual | {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} reduction in global military spending redirected to medical research |
| **R&D Savings** | Recurring | {{< var dfda_rd_gross_savings_annual >}}/year | Perpetual | {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}× trial cost reduction from pragmatic trial model |
| **Total Recurring** | Recurring | {{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual >}}/year | Perpetual | Peace dividend + R&D savings (makes system self-funding) |
| **Total Value** | Combined | {{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}} + recurring | Once + perpetual | One-time timeline shift + perpetual annual benefits |

**Investment required**: {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} (one-time campaign cost)

### Research Acceleration Mechanism

The {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× research acceleration multiplier comes from scaling the Oxford RECOVERY trial approach globally:

**Current System Baseline**:

- {{< var current_trials_per_year >}} {{< var current_trials_per_year_cite >}} clinical trials initiated per year
- [60% completion rate](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) = **{{< var current_completed_trials_per_year >}} completed trials/year**
- {{< var current_active_trials >}} {{< var current_active_trials_cite >}} active trials at any time (3-5 year duration)
- {{< var current_patient_participation_rate >}} patient participation ({{< var current_trial_slots_available >}} trial slots for {{< var current_disease_patients_global >}} [people with chronic disease](../references.qmd#disease-prevalence-2-billion))
- {{< var current_trial_abandonment_rate >}} {{< var current_trial_abandonment_rate_cite >}} abandonment rate (studies never complete)
- [6-18 months to recruit 100 patients](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)

**Pragmatic Trial System Performance** (RECOVERY model scaled globally):

- {{< var dfda_trials_per_year_capacity >}} trials/year capacity
- [95% completion rate](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) = **{{< var dfda_completed_trials_per_year >}} completed trials/year**
- {{< var dfda_active_trials >}} active trials at any time (3-12 month duration)
- {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} patient eligibility ([1.2B eligible](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) with minimal exclusions)
- {{< var dfda_trial_abandonment_rate >}} abandonment rate (patient subsidies flip economic incentives)
- 3 weeks to recruit {{< var traditional_large_trial_size >}} {{< var traditional_large_trial_size_cite >}} patients (RECOVERY achieved this enrollment speed)

**How the {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× Multiplier Works**:

The acceleration comes from simple economics: DIH can fund {{< var dih_patients_fundable_annually >}} patients/year at [RECOVERY trial cost](../references.qmd#recovery-cost-500) ({{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}}/patient), compared to [current global trial participation](../references.qmd#global-trial-participant-capacity) of {{< var current_trial_slots_available >}} patients/year (IQVIA 2022).

{{< var research_acceleration_multiplier_latex >}}

This represents DIH's funding capacity alone, without assuming behavior changes from the existing {{< var global_med_research_spending >}} baseline research ecosystem.

**Net Effect**:

## Personal Economic Impact: From Societal to Individual

The aggregate societal benefits ({{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}}-{{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual >}} annually) result from individual economic gains multiplied across billions of people. Understanding individual impact helps explain both the scale and the equity of the Disease Eradication Model.

## Comparative Effectiveness

This section compares the 1% Treaty/dFDA system to best-in-class health interventions across multiple categories.

### Comprehensive Comparison

| Intervention Type | Metric | Performance | Annual Benefit |
|:---|:---|---:|---:|
| **1% Treaty/dFDA** | Cost per life saved | **$1.1M profit** | {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} |
| **1% Treaty/dFDA** | Cost per QALY | {{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}} (cost-dominant) | {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} QALYs |
| **Childhood Vaccinations** | Annual benefit | Self-funding | ~{{< var childhood_vaccination_annual_benefit >}} |
| **GiveWell Top Charities** | Cost per life saved | {{< var givewell_cost_per_life_min >}}-{{< var givewell_cost_per_life_max >}} | Variable |
| **GiveWell Top Charities** | Cost per QALY | {{< var givewell_cost_per_life_min >}}-{{< var givewell_cost_per_life_max >}} | Variable |
| **Smoking Cessation** | Annual benefit | Billions | Billions |

### The Critical Difference

GiveWell charities are the **best ways to spend money** saving lives. They're heroic and incredibly efficient.

This doesn't spend money. It **generates profit** while saving lives.

#### Translation

- Best charity: Costs {{< var givewell_cost_per_life_min >}}-{{< var givewell_cost_per_life_max >}} per life saved (excellent)
- This system: Makes $1.1M profit per life saved

One requires infinite fundraising from finite donors. The other prints money while curing diseases.

Both are good. One breaks the usual economic rules.

**Why this is different from other interventions:**

Vaccines and smoking cessation programs solve specific problems with high returns - they're amazing interventions.

The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty pays for itself by solving two problems at once:

1. **The Peace Dividend** ({{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} annually) - created simply by reducing global conflict spending 1%
2. **Pragmatic trial infrastructure** - uses a fraction of that dividend to fix the *system* of medical research, generating a second massive win

When you redirect the world's largest source of waste (conflict spending) to fund its most impactful opportunity (medical research), the math gets wild.

**Scale**: Conservative benefits ({{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} annually) exceed childhood vaccinations by {{< var treaty_benefit_multiplier_vs_vaccines >}}×.

For detailed comparisons, see [Intervention Comparison Table](../appendix/intervention-comparison-table.qmd).


## Who Benefits and How

The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty creates positive economic incentives across all major groups, eliminating traditional opposition to healthcare system reform. This alignment makes it politically feasible and sustainable.

**Who Gets What** (see [Aligning Incentives](../solution/aligning-incentives.qmd) for details):

- **Defense sector**: Keeps {{< var defense_sector_retention_pct >}} of current budget 
- **Pharmaceutical industry**: Trial costs shift from expense to revenue (patients fund participation); [research capacity](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) increases {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}×
- **Insurance companies**: Net savings from [reduced disease burden](../references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t) ({{< var global_disease_economic_burden_annual >}} current economic cost)
- **Healthcare providers**: More treatment options; [earlier access to effective therapies](../appendix/economic-value-of-accelerated-treatments.qmd)
- **Patients**: Access to clinical trials as healthcare and new treatments years or decades sooner
- **Taxpayers**: Net reduction in taxes and healthcare costs through improved R&D efficiency

See [Aligning Incentives](../solution/aligning-incentives.qmd) for detailed analysis and implementation strategy.

## Implementation Strategy

The economic benefits outlined above demonstrate the value proposition of the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty system. Implementation requires political mobilization to achieve treaty adoption:

**For comprehensive implementation details**, see:

- **[Campaign Budget](campaign-budget.qmd)** - Detailed breakdown of political mobilization costs
- **[VICTORY Social Impact Bonds](victory-bonds.qmd)** - Financing mechanism for lobbying efforts
- **[Financial Plan Overview](financial-plan.qmd)** - Complete fundraising, spending, and treasury management framework

### Campaign Budget Breakdown

The {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} [campaign cost](campaign-budget.qmd) (used as denominator in complete case {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 ROI) allocates funds across three strategic categories:

| Budget Category | Amount | Purpose |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **[Global Referendum](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_referendum >}} | Global direct democracy campaign (280M votes), biometric verification, viral referral system, platform development. [Scenario analysis](campaign-budget.qmd#base-case-scenario): $140M-$406M depending on adoption curve |
| **[Political Lobbying](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}} | Legislative outreach (US/EU/G20), Super PACs, defense industry conversion, legal/compliance, opposition research. Outspends pharma + MIC combined |
| **[Reserve Fund](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_reserve >}} | Post-victory transition, treaty implementation support, contingency buffer |
| **Total Campaign Cost** | **{{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}}** | 4-year implementation timeline |

This budget is designed for a 3-5 year campaign to achieve treaty ratification by major powers, representing less than 4% of the first year's conservative benefits ({{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}}). The campaign cost is a one-time investment with perpetual returns, as the system becomes self-sustaining through the captured peace dividend.

This economic analysis focuses on the return on investment once the system is operational, demonstrating that the intervention generates {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 to {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 returns regardless of the specific path to adoption.

## Implementation Challenges and Risk Mitigation

This section addresses common objections and potential failure modes, along with specific mitigation strategies.

### The "But Politicians Won't Do It" Problem

**What could go wrong**: Politicians refuse to redirect {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of military spending to medical research because defense contractors oppose the change.

**Why this actually won't happen**:

Defense lobbyists currently get [$1,813 back for every $1 spent](../references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc) on political influence. You're offering Victory bondholders {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns. That's better. Defense contractors can do basic arithmetic.

When you show them a spreadsheet where they keep {{< var defense_sector_retention_pct >}} of their current contracts PLUS get {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns on bonds, they stop lobbying against you and start lobbying for you.

You're not defeating greed. You're aligning economic incentives to direct existing profit motives toward medical research.

Historical precedent: After WW2, military spending was cut by {{< var post_ww2_military_cut_pct >}} {{< var post_ww2_military_cut_pct_cite >}}, contributing to substantial economic growth. The proposed {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} reduction is significantly more modest.

See [Treaty Adoption Strategy](../strategy/treaty-adoption-strategy.qmd) for detailed implementation strategy.

### Safety Concerns

**Objection**: Decentralized trials may miss dangerous side effects.

**Response**: Pragmatic trials with larger samples and continuous monitoring detect safety problems faster than traditional trials.

**Phase I safety testing is preserved**: The dFDA retains rigorous Phase I safety testing (~{{< var phase_1_safety_duration_years >}} years), which successfully prevented the Thalidomide disaster in the US.

**What changes:** Eliminating the {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}} {{< var efficacy_lag_years_cite >}}-year efficacy delay AFTER safety is proven. You still can't sell poison. You just don't have to wait 8 years to prove aspirin helps headaches AFTER you've already proved it doesn't kill people.

**Superior safety surveillance**:

| Safety Dimension | Traditional Trials | Pragmatic Trials |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Sample size | 100-300 patients | 10,000-100,000+ patients |
| Patient selection | {{< var antidepressant_trial_exclusion_rate >}} [excluded](../references.qmd#antidepressant-trial-exclusion-rates) (comorbidities, age, medications) | All volunteers included |
| Monitoring duration | 3-12 months | Continuous through EHR integration |
| Publication | 37% of negative results published | 100% automatically published |
| Subpopulation testing | Excludes elderly, children, pregnant patients | Tests all populations |

**Empirical validation**: The [RECOVERY trial](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) tested 6 treatments on 47,000 patients in 3 months at {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} per patient, identifying effective treatments (dexamethasone) and ruling out harmful ones (hydroxychloroquine) faster than traditional trials.

**Historical evidence**: Long-term Benadryl dementia risk went undetected for 40+ years under current surveillance. Continuous EHR monitoring would detect such effects in 2-3 years.

**Type II error dominates**: [Regulatory mortality analysis](../appendix/regulatory-mortality-analysis.qmd) shows {{< var type_ii_error_cost_ratio >}}:1 harm ratio - for every person saved by preventing unsafe drug approval, {{< var type_ii_error_cost_ratio >}} people die waiting for approval of beneficial treatments.

**The FDA prevents some harms but causes far more deaths through delay**. While Phase I safety testing successfully prevents toxic compounds from reaching patients (Type I errors), the barriers the FDA places between patients and beneficial treatments cause {{< var type_ii_error_cost_ratio >}}× more deaths than they prevent (Type II errors). [Regulatory mortality analysis](../appendix/regulatory-mortality-analysis.qmd) calls this the "Invisible Graveyard": {{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} deaths (1962-2024) from the {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}}-year delay between safety verification and final approval.

For detailed analysis, see [Regulatory Mortality Analysis](../appendix/regulatory-mortality-analysis.qmd).

### The "But Patients Won't Participate" Problem

**What could go wrong**: Not enough patients volunteer for decentralized trials.

**Why this actually won't happen**:

{{< var patient_willingness_trial_participation_pct >}} {{< var patient_willingness_trial_participation_pct_cite >}} of people say they're willing to participate in clinical trials, but currently only {{< var current_clinical_trial_participation_rate >}} {{< var current_clinical_trial_participation_rate_cite >}} actually participate because:

- Trials require [traveling up to hundreds of miles to university hospitals](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-geographic-barriers) (67 miles on average, 500+ miles for rural/central US patients)
- Trials exclude {{< var antidepressant_trial_exclusion_rate >}} of [actual patients](../references.qmd#antidepressant-trial-exclusion-rates) (too old, too young, too sick, wrong kind of sick)
- Trials pay nothing and cost weeks of your time

Decentralized pragmatic trials fix all of this:

- Join from your couch
- Everyone qualifies (you don't need to be the perfect kind of sick)
- Get subsidized to participate + access to treatments

Current barrier: Geographic travel requirements, restrictive eligibility criteria, months of waiting
New barrier: Digital enrollment in trials from home, minimal exclusions, immediate or scheduled participation

{{< var patient_willingness_trial_participation_pct >}} of patients are willing to participate in clinical trials, yet only {{< var current_patient_participation_rate >}} actually do. The bottleneck isn't human willingness, it's the requirement for dedicated trial infrastructure and restrictive eligibility criteria.

### Who's Actually In Charge (Patients Edition)

The Decentralized Institutes of Health puts patients in control through trial participation, not committee votes.

**Current system**: [200 NIH bureaucrats](../references.qmd#nih-decision-makers-200-people) decide what {{< var global_population_2024 >}} humans can try when dying

**New system**: Patients choose which trials to join. Trials that attract patients get funded. Trials that don't, die.

Your subsidy follows you to whichever trial you join. Researchers compete to design trials that patients actually want to participate in. No committees, no grant-writing contests, no bureaucrats deciding what's "worthy" of study.

All transactions publicly recorded. All spending transparent. All decisions auditable.

Patients select which trials to join. Trials that attract participants receive funding. Researchers compete for patient participation rather than committee grants.

The system operates through distributed infrastructure:

- Open-source protocols (anyone can verify how it works)
- Distributed validation (no single point of failure)
- Works with existing regulators (additive layer, not replacement)

### Accountability measures

- Annual third-party audits of DIH treasury and dFDA operations
- Public reporting of all spending and outcomes
- Milestone-based funding (money releases when targets hit)

See [Governance and Accountability](../appendix/governance.qmd) and [Legal Structure](../appendix/legal-compliance-framework.qmd) for the complete system that prevents this from becoming another bureaucratic nightmare where nothing happens and everyone dies while committees meet.


## Limitations and Uncertainties

This analysis acknowledges several important limitations and sources of uncertainty inherent in modeling a transformative policy intervention of this scale.

### Model Assumptions and Constraints

### Adoption Timeline Uncertainty

The base case assumes gradual adoption over {{< var dfda_npv_adoption_ramp_years >}} years to full implementation. Actual adoption may be faster or slower depending on:

- **Regulatory harmonization:** International coordination requirements may extend implementation timelines
- **Technical infrastructure readiness:** EHR interoperability, data standardization, and privacy compliance vary significantly across jurisdictions
- **Industry cooperation:** Pharmaceutical companies, regulators, and healthcare providers will resist or accelerate adoption based on whether they profit from it

**Sensitivity analysis addresses this:** Worst-case scenario models extended timelines with ROI remaining positive (66:1) even under pessimistic assumptions.

### Cost Reduction Assumptions

The {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} baseline R&D cost reduction derives from the Oxford RECOVERY trial's demonstrated {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}}× efficiency gain. However:

- **Trial complexity variation:** The RECOVERY trial focused on repurposed drugs for acute conditions; novel therapeutics for chronic diseases may not achieve equivalent cost reductions
- **Regulatory requirements:** Some trial phases (particularly safety studies) may retain higher costs regardless of decentralization
- **Geographic variation:** Cost reductions may be greater in high-cost jurisdictions (U.S., Europe) and lower in regions with already-efficient trial systems

**Conservative approach:** Analysis uses {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} reduction (midpoint) rather than the demonstrated 95%+ efficiency gains, providing substantial margin of safety.

### Generalizability from RECOVERY Trial and Historical Precedent

The analysis relies significantly on the Oxford RECOVERY trial as empirical evidence for cost reductions ({{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}× efficiency gain). Potential concerns about generalizing from a single case study are addressed through historical context:

**Historical validation:** The physician-led pragmatic trial model has {{< var pre_1962_validation_years >}} years of empirical validation (1883-1960), not merely one modern case study. {{< var pre_1962_physician_count >}} physicians tested treatments on real patients in routine practice before the 1962 regulatory shift.

**Trial complexity variation:** RECOVERY studied repurposed drugs (dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine) for acute COVID-19 treatment. Novel therapeutics for chronic diseases may face different challenges. However:

- Conservative estimate uses 50-70% cost reduction (not the 95%+ demonstrated by RECOVERY)
- Pre-1962 system achieved similar efficiencies across diverse therapeutic areas (not limited to repurposed drugs)
- [Pragmatic trial literature](../references.qmd#pragmatic-trials-patsopoulos-2011) consistently shows 50-95% cost reductions across multiple contexts

**Conclusion:** While RECOVERY provides modern validation, the fundamental approach (decentralized physician-led efficacy testing) has extensive historical precedent suggesting generalizability beyond single case studies.

### Diminishing Returns in Research Productivity

Economic literature documents declining research productivity over time. [Bloom et al. (2020)](../references.qmd#bloom-ideas-getting-harder-2020) show research productivity falling ~5% annually across industries, with Moore's Law requiring 18× more researchers than in the 1970s to achieve constant improvement rates.

#### Why this critique may not apply

This intervention targets a different margin than traditional research scaling. Bloom et al. measure **idea productivity** (breakthroughs per researcher-year). Our intervention targets **trial execution efficiency** (cost per patient enrolled, completion rates, recruitment speed).

#### Distinction

- **Bloom et al.:** Diminishing returns to *discovery* of new ideas (fundamental scientific breakthroughs getting harder to find)
- **dFDA model:** Improving *execution* of existing trial designs (removing administrative friction, not discovering new biology)

**Empirical evidence for efficiency gains:** RECOVERY trial and pre-1962 physician-led system both achieved 80-95% cost reductions by eliminating overhead (redundant monitoring, bespoke infrastructure, excessive documentation), not by making scientific discoveries easier.

**Sensitivity:** Even applying 50% diminishing returns adjustment to research acceleration estimates, ROI remains 230:1 (conservative) to 620:1 (complete). The intervention remains cost-effective under pessimistic productivity assumptions.

### Pragmatic Trial Internal Validity and Selection Bias

Decentralized trials with broad eligibility criteria face potential selection bias concerns. Traditional randomized controlled trials use restrictive eligibility *precisely* to control confounding and establish internal validity.

**Trade-off between internal and external validity:** [Patsopoulos (2011)](../references.qmd#pragmatic-trials-patsopoulos-2011) documents that pragmatic trials often find 15-25% smaller effect sizes than explanatory trials but offer superior external validity (generalizability to real-world populations).

#### Mitigation strategies

- **Randomization preserved:** dFDA maintains random treatment assignment (the core causal identification strategy)
- **Large sample sizes:** Decentralized recruitment enables 10-100× larger trials, improving statistical power and subgroup analysis
- **Covariate adjustment:** Electronic health record data enables controlling for confounders ex-post using propensity score matching and instrumental variables
- **Replication at scale:** Lower costs enable rapid replication across diverse populations, testing robustness

**Empirical evidence, observational studies produce valid results:** A [meta-analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200006223422506) compared effect sizes from high-quality observational studies to randomized controlled trials across multiple interventions. The findings demonstrate that well-designed observational studies produce results statistically indistinguishable from expensive RCTs.

![Comparison of effect sizes from observational studies versus randomized trials for mortality outcomes, showing strong concordance between methodologies.](../../assets/observational-vs-randomized-effect-sizes.png)

![Comparison of effect sizes from observational studies versus randomized trials across diverse outcomes, demonstrating that observational methods yield similar conclusions when properly designed.](../../assets/observational-vs-randomized-trial-effect-sizes.png)

These meta-analytic findings support the validity of pragmatic trial designs used in the dFDA model. Modern statistical methods, large sample sizes, and proper covariate adjustment enable observational and quasi-experimental designs to achieve causal inference comparable to traditional RCTs at a fraction of the cost.

**Historical precedent:** Pre-1962 physician-led system successfully identified effective treatments (antibiotics, vaccines, surgical techniques) despite lacking modern randomization, suggesting real-world evidence can establish causality when combined with peer review and replication.

**Publication bias:** Traditional trials face severe publication bias: only [37% of negative results are published compared to 94% of positive results](../references.qmd#publication-bias-clinical-trials), leading to overestimation of treatment effectiveness and [~$100 billion annually wasted on repeating failed experiments](../references.qmd#wasted-spending-on-failed-experiments). The dFDA system addresses this by design: all trials are registered in the public database, all results (positive and negative) are automatically published through the transparent data infrastructure, and the open data architecture ensures no selective reporting. Unlike traditional systems where researchers choose what to publish, dFDA's mandatory publication of all registered trials eliminates publication bias as a concern.

**Conclusion:** Internal validity concerns are acknowledged, but the combination of randomization, large samples, and replication capacity provides adequate causal inference even with broader eligibility criteria.

### QALY Calculation Uncertainties

The {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} annual QALY estimate aggregates three benefit streams with varying levels of empirical support:

**Stream A (Accelerated Drug Access):** High confidence, based on well-documented costs of delayed access (84,000 life-years lost per year delay in cancer therapies alone). However:

- Assumes pipeline drugs would eventually reach approval under current system
- Does not account for reduced efficacy if treatments reach patients in later disease stages

**Stream B (Prevention via Real-World Evidence):** Medium confidence, preventative care benefits are well-established, but scale of improvement from comprehensive data remains uncertain:

- Adherence improvements may be smaller than projected
- Selection bias in opt-in populations could limit generalizability

**Stream C (Rare Disease Treatments):** Lower confidence, economic viability of rare disease research is theoretically sound but empirically unproven at scale:

- Assumes cost reductions make trials economically viable
- Actual success rates for rare disease therapies remain uncertain

**Conservative approach:** Base case uses median estimates across all three streams; sensitivity analysis demonstrates positive returns even at conservative QALY levels ({{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} annually yields {{< var treaty_complete_roi_conditional_95th_percentile >}}:1 ROI).

### Data Limitations

### Military Spending Data

Global military expenditure data ({{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}}, SIPRI 2024) is well-documented but:

- **Off-budget spending:** Some military expenditures may be classified or categorized elsewhere
- **Exchange rate fluctuations:** Multi-year projections require currency assumptions
- **Conflict zones:** Military spending in active conflict regions may be less fungible for redirection

### Clinical Trial Market Sizing

The {{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual >}} {{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual_cite >}} global clinical trials market estimate derives from industry reports, which:

- **Industry variation:** Methodologies vary across market research firms
- **Private vs. public trials:** Some trial spending may be unreported or proprietary
- **Non-pharmaceutical trials:** Medical device and digital health trials may have different cost structures

### QALY Valuation Thresholds

Standard willingness-to-pay thresholds ({{< var who_qaly_threshold_cost_effective >}}-{{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}} {{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd_cite >}} per QALY) vary by jurisdiction:

- **Geographic variation:** WHO recommends 1-3× GDP per capita; high-income countries use higher thresholds
- **Ethical considerations:** Monetary QALY valuations raise equity concerns
- **Discount rates:** Future health benefits discounted at {{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} may undervalue long-term gains

### Generalizability Constraints

### Political Feasibility

This analysis models economic returns conditional on treaty ratification. Political feasibility depends on:

- **Geopolitical stability:** International cooperation requirements may face challenges during periods of global tension
- **Domestic politics:** Military budget reductions face constituency resistance in defense-dependent regions
- **Lobbying influence:** Defense industry opposition may impede adoption

**Risk assessment:** The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} reduction is intentionally modest to minimize political resistance. Historical precedents (military-to-civilian conversions post-Cold War) demonstrate feasibility.

### Institutional Capacity

Implementation requires substantial institutional development:

- **Regulatory expertise:** dFDA requires experienced personnel (FDA, EMA, other regulators)
- **Technical infrastructure:** Data systems, AI/ML capabilities, cybersecurity at global scale
- **Legal frameworks:** International treaties, data privacy compliance, intellectual property harmonization

**Mitigation:** Phased implementation allows capacity building concurrent with scale-up.

### Healthcare System Integration

Benefits assume integration with existing healthcare infrastructure:

- **EHR interoperability:** U.S. and other jurisdictions still face significant interoperability challenges
- **Wearable adoption:** Real-world data collection requires widespread wearable/digital health adoption
- **Provider participation:** Clinician buy-in necessary for trial recruitment and data quality

### Uncertainty Quantification

### Primary Risk Factors

The following table summarizes key risk factors and their mitigation strategies:

| Risk Factor | Level | Primary Uncertainty | Mitigation Strategy |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **Political Risk** | VERY HIGH | Treaty ratification dependent on international coordination | Modest {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} reduction; precedent from military-industrial lobbying ROI (1,813:1) |
| **Execution Risk** | HIGH | Complex global legal/technical coordination required | Phased implementation; leverage existing regulatory expertise |
| **Regulatory Risk** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Harmonization across jurisdictions varies | Pilot programs in willing jurisdictions first |
| **Market Risk** | VERY LOW | {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}} military spending already allocated | Redirection rather than new appropriation |
| **Technical Risk** | MEDIUM | Data interoperability, AI/ML accuracy | Build on proven platforms ([Medable $521M raised, $2.1B valuation](../references.qmd#dct-platform-funding-medable)) |

### Scenario Analysis Robustness

Comprehensive sensitivity analysis across multiple scenarios demonstrates:

- **Worst-case ({{< var treaty_complete_roi_conditional_95th_percentile >}}:1 ROI):** Benefits half as good, costs twice as high, intervention remains highly cost-effective
- **Conservative ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI):** R&D savings only, excludes peace dividend, intervention is dominant
- **Complete ({{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 ROI):** All quantifiable benefits, intervention transforms global health economics

**Key insight:** Even under pessimistic assumptions with multiple adverse conditions simultaneously occurring, the intervention generates positive returns exceeding most established public health programs.

### External Validity Considerations

### Transferability Across Contexts

This analysis models global implementation. Results may vary by:

- **Income level:** High-income countries may see greater cost reductions (trials more expensive); low-income countries may see greater health gains (larger disease burden)
- **Disease profiles:** Communicable disease contexts (prevalent in low-income settings) vs. chronic disease contexts (prevalent in high-income settings) may yield different QALY gains
- **Regulatory maturity:** Countries with established regulatory frameworks may implement faster

### Temporal Validity

Projections use 2024 baseline data. Secular trends may affect outcomes:

- **Medical technology advancement:** AI/ML capabilities improving rapidly; may enhance or diminish relative dFDA advantages
- **Geopolitical shifts:** Global military spending trends dependent on international relations
- **Healthcare costs:** Rising healthcare expenditures may increase baseline benefits; cost controls may decrease them

### General Equilibrium Effects

This analysis employs partial equilibrium methodology, holding prices and market structures constant while evaluating the intervention's direct effects. General equilibrium analysis would account for market adjustments to the $27.2B annual reallocation from military to medical research spending.

**Unmodeled general equilibrium effects include**:

1. **Data infrastructure scaling costs**: Decentralized trial infrastructure uses automated software (federated queries, not centralized databases), scaling through technology rather than labor. Unlike traditional research that faces researcher supply constraints, the system leverages existing EHR systems (Epic, Cerner) and adds coordination protocols. Marginal scaling costs are low relative to traditional models.

2. **Clinical trial market price effects**: Increasing trial demand by {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× could affect equilibrium prices for clinical research services. However, the pragmatic trial approach *reduces* per-trial costs ({{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}× cheaper via automation), suggesting supply constraints may not bind. Traditional trials cost {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_fda_example_41k >}} per patient; decentralized trials target {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} per patient by eliminating overhead, not by increasing demand for scarce inputs.

3. **Crowding out effects**: Does $27.2B in new medical research displace existing research funding, or does it add incrementally? Conservative assumption: fully additive. If partially substitutive (e.g., governments reduce NIH funding in response), net research increase would be lower than modeled.

4. **Quality versus quantity trade-off**: {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× more trials may not yield proportional breakthroughs if resources spread thin or trial quality declines. The analysis assumes quality maintenance through peer review and replication; actual quality effects remain uncertain.

**Conservative treatment in base case**: The analysis excludes general equilibrium effects from benefit calculations, providing a lower bound estimate.

**Methodological limitation acknowledged**: Full general equilibrium modeling (computable general equilibrium models with labor markets, international trade, and technology diffusion) would require substantial additional complexity beyond this analysis scope. The partial equilibrium approach follows standard cost-benefit analysis methodology for policy interventions.


### Failure Modes and Risk Scenarios

The economic analysis presented above assumes successful implementation of the dFDA system. This section explicitly examines failure modes that could prevent anticipated benefits from materializing, acknowledging that positive ROI estimates are conditional on effective execution.

### Implementation Failure Scenarios

#### False Positive Detection

**Risk**: Decentralized trials could produce false positive results, leading to approval of ineffective treatments.

**Mechanism**: Broader eligibility criteria and real-world settings introduce potential confounders. Without stringent monitoring, selection bias or inadequate randomization could yield spurious treatment effects.

**Consequence**: Approval of ineffective drugs wastes healthcare resources, erodes public trust, and potentially causes harm if ineffective treatments displace superior alternatives.

**Mitigation strategies in dFDA design**:

- Randomization preserved as core causal identification mechanism
- Large sample sizes (10-100× traditional trials) improve statistical power and enable sensitivity analysis
- Replication requirements across diverse populations test robustness
- Bayesian adaptive trial designs update probabilities continuously based on accumulating evidence
- Post-market surveillance using continuous real-world data collection detects efficacy deterioration

**Residual risk**: Even with mitigation, decentralized settings may have higher false positive rates than traditional controlled trials. This represents a fundamental trade-off between internal validity (causal certainty) and external validity (real-world generalizability).

##### Regulatory Rejection

**Risk**: Regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA) refuse to accept dFDA trial evidence for approval decisions.

**Mechanism**: Regulators may view decentralized trial data as insufficiently rigorous, cite concerns about data quality, or face political pressure from pharmaceutical companies and CROs invested in traditional trial infrastructure.

**Consequence**: Even if dFDA trials generate valid efficacy evidence, failure to achieve regulatory acceptance prevents market access. The entire cost-reduction thesis collapses if dFDA trials must be repeated using traditional methods for approval.

**Empirical precedent**: FDA's accelerated approval pathway and RECOVERY trial's global emergency use authorization demonstrate regulatory willingness to accept alternative evidence standards when public health benefits are clear.

**Mitigation strategies**:

- Pilot programs establish proof-of-concept in willing jurisdictions (e.g., UK MHRA, which already accepted RECOVERY evidence)
- Regulatory harmonization efforts (ICH guidelines) create international standards for pragmatic trial designs
- Phased implementation allows regulators to observe real-world performance before full commitment
- Hybrid trial designs combine pragmatic Phase III efficacy testing with traditional Phase II safety validation

**Residual risk**: Regulatory capture by pharmaceutical industry incumbents could block adoption. See [Investor Risk Analysis](../appendix/investor-risk-analysis.qmd) for political economy analysis of implementation barriers.

##### Pharmaceutical Industry Adoption Failure

**Risk**: Pharmaceutical companies decline to use dFDA platform, preferring traditional controlled trials despite higher costs.

**Mechanism**: Industry may resist for several reasons:

- **Control preference**: Traditional trials offer greater control over patient selection, endpoints, and data interpretation
- **Intellectual property concerns**: Sharing data with decentralized platforms may expose competitive information
- **Risk aversion**: Established trial methods are predictable; dFDA represents uncertain innovation
- **Regulatory conservatism**: Companies may prefer proven pathways over novel approaches requiring regulatory negotiation

**Consequence**: If pharmaceutical industry participation is low, dFDA trial volume remains small, preventing economies of scale and limiting cost reductions. The intervention fails to transform drug development economics.

**Mitigation strategies**:

- Economic incentives: {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}× cost reduction creates overwhelming financial motivation for adoption
- First-mover advantages: Companies adopting early gain competitive speed-to-market advantages
- Regulatory push: If regulators preferentially review dFDA submissions (shorter timelines), companies face competitive pressure to adopt
- Public funding focus: Government-funded research (NIH, Wellcome Trust) can mandate dFDA platform use, creating initial scale

**Empirical precedent**: Electronic data capture systems and clinical trial registries faced similar industry resistance but achieved near-universal adoption once cost benefits became clear or regulatory requirements were established.

**Residual risk**: Oligopolistic pharmaceutical market structure enables coordinated resistance. Large incumbents may lobby against dFDA adoption to protect barriers to entry against smaller competitors.

### Conditional Benefits Interpretation

The ROI estimates ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 conservative, {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 complete) are **conditional on successful implementation**, they represent returns *if* the dFDA operates as designed. Expected value analysis (see "Expected Value Analysis Accounting for Political Risk" section) incorporates probability-weighted scenarios. This section examines operational and technical failure modes that could occur even after political success, complementing the [Investor Risk Analysis](../appendix/investor-risk-analysis.qmd) focus on political barriers. Pilot implementations should monitor false positive rates, adverse event detection sensitivity, regulatory acceptance rates, and industry adoption velocity to enable early course corrections.

### Limitations Summary

Despite these limitations, several factors support the analysis's robustness:

1. **Conservative assumptions throughout:** Base case uses median estimates; optimistic scenarios excluded from primary ROI ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1)
2. **Empirical grounding:** Cost reductions based on demonstrated RECOVERY trial results, not theoretical models
3. **Sensitivity analysis:** Wide range of scenarios tested; positive returns maintained across all plausible parameter combinations
4. **Dominant intervention status:** Cost-dominant intervention ({{< var treaty_dfda_cost_per_daly_timeline_shift >}} per DALY) means it saves money even if health benefits are substantially overstated

**Transparency commitment:** All parameters, data sources, and calculation methodologies are publicly documented with confidence levels and last-update dates in [Parameters and Calculations Reference](../appendix/parameters-and-calculations.qmd) and [References](../references.qmd).

Future research priorities include prospective data collection during pilot implementations, real-world validation of cost reduction estimates, and longitudinal assessment of QALY gains across diverse populations and disease contexts.


## Conclusion

Redirecting {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military spending to medical research generates {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 to {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 ROI, depending on what you count.

**The Numbers**:

- **Zero new spending**: Money redirected from existing military budgets
- **Dominant intervention**: Saves money while saving lives (rare in health economics)
- **Conservative case**: {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI counting only R&D efficiency

{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only_latex >}}

([full analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd))

- **Complete case**: {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 ROI including all eight benefit streams ({{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual >}} annually)
- **Lives saved**: {{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} while generating net profit
- **Political feasibility**: Everyone profits (nobody needs to be convinced, just paid)

**Comparison**: Exceeds smallpox eradication and childhood vaccinations - history's previous best public health achievements - while requiring zero charitable donations. ([Detailed comparisons](../appendix/intervention-comparison-table.qmd))

**Timeline**: [36 months](../strategy/roadmap.qmd) from global referendum to full deployment. ([Complete roadmap](../strategy/roadmap.qmd))

**The Evidence**: Conservative assumptions, validated by [Oxford RECOVERY trial](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd), tested via [sensitivity analysis](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd). Uses standard health economics (NPV, QALYs, ICER) for direct comparison with existing interventions.

**The Reality**: This works because every step is economically rational for everyone involved. Nobody needs to evolve morally. They just need to count.
