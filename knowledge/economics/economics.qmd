## Abstract

**Objective**: Evaluate the economic and health outcomes of reallocating {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military spending ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually) to subsidize universal patient participation in pragmatic clinical trials modeled on the Oxford RECOVERY trial approach, where patient subsidies make trial participation financially attractive for both patients and treatment providers.

**Methods**: Cost-benefit analysis, net present value (NPV) calculations, quality-adjusted life year (QALY) modeling, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) analysis. Data from SIPRI military expenditure database, WHO mortality statistics, Oxford RECOVERY trial results, and published clinical trial cost literature. Both conservative (R&D efficiency only) and complete (all quantifiable benefits) scenarios assessed.

**Results**: Conservative analysis yields {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI ({{< var dfda_npv_net_benefit_conservative >}} benefit / {{< var dfda_npv_total_cost >}} cost) over {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years from R&D cost reductions alone. Complete analysis including peace dividend and seven additional benefit categories demonstrates {{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 ROI ({{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual >}} annually). The intervention generates {{< var global_dfda_qalys_gained_annual >}} QALYs annually with negative ICER ({{< var dfda_icer_per_qaly >}}/QALY)—economist code for "saves money while saving lives." Sensitivity analysis shows robust returns even when everything goes wrong ({{< var conservative_scenario_roi >}}:1 worst-case to {{< var optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 best-case).

**Conclusions**: Redirecting {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of military spending to medical research represents a dominant health intervention, simultaneously reducing costs while improving health outcomes, with ROI exceeding smallpox eradication and every other public health achievement in history. The self-funding structure (money appears from reduced military spending) eliminates traditional barriers to scale. Unlike charity, which requires infinite begging to finite donors, this generates {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} annual surplus while curing diseases.

**Keywords**: 1% Treaty, Victory Bonds, Decentralized FDA, Decentralized Institutes of Health, self-funding health intervention, negative cost per life saved, 463:1 to 11,540:1 ROI, regulatory delay elimination, greed-aligned incentives

## Key Findings

1. **Conservative ROI**: {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 (counting only R&D efficiency, ignoring everything else that makes this look "too good")
   - {{< var dfda_npv_benefit >}} benefit / {{< var dfda_npv_total_cost >}} cost over {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years

2. **Complete ROI**: {{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 (counting everything, at which point reality stops caring about sounding believable)
   - {{< var treaty_complete_case_annual_benefits >}} annual benefits / {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} campaign cost

3. **Self-Funding**: Zero new spending, just move 1% from the "making corpses" budget ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually from {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}} total military spending)

4. **Lives Saved**: {{< var treaty_total_lives_saved_annual >}} annually at net societal **profit** of {{< var treaty_net_benefit_per_life_saved >}} per life
   - (The number is positive. You make money saving lives. Economics is backwards here.)

5. **Dominant Intervention**: Negative ICER ({{< var dfda_icer_per_qaly >}}/QALY) means it saves money while saving lives
   - Beats smallpox eradication ({{< var smallpox_eradication_roi >}} {{< var smallpox_eradication_roi_cite >}}:1)
   - Generates profit per life saved rather than requiring subsidy

6. **Research Acceleration**: {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× more trials completed (from removing the bureaucratic performance art)

7. **Robust Returns**: Even if costs double and benefits halve, still get {{< var conservative_scenario_roi >}}:1 to {{< var optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 ROI
   - (The "everything goes catastrophically wrong" scenario still beats most investments)

## Research Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis**: Reallocating {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military spending ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually) to fund decentralized pragmaticclinical trials generates return on investment between {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 (conservative estimate, R&D savings only) and {{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 (complete estimate, including peace dividend and all direct benefits), representing a dominant health intervention that simultaneously reduces costs while improving health outcomes.

**Null Hypothesis (H₀)**: The intervention does not generate positive net economic value (ROI ≤ 1:1)

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)**: The intervention generates substantial positive returns (ROI > 1:1), comparable to or exceeding history's most successful public health interventions (smallpox eradication: {{< var smallpox_eradication_roi >}} {{< var smallpox_eradication_roi_cite >}}:1)

**Testable Predictions**:

- Conservative case: NPV benefit exceeds $100B over {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}}-year horizon
- Cost-effectiveness: ICER < $0/QALY (cost-saving while improving health)
- Research acceleration: >10× increase in trial completion rates
- Self-funding threshold: Annual benefits exceed annual costs by year 3 of implementation

## Nomenclature and Key Terms

**NPV (Net Present Value)**: Economic metric that discounts future cash flows to present-day values, accounting for the time value of money. Used to compare costs and benefits occurring at different times.

**QALY (Quality-Adjusted Life Year)**: Standard health economics measure combining quantity and quality of life. One QALY = one year of life in perfect health. Used to compare health interventions across different conditions.

**ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio)**: Cost per QALY gained, calculated as (Cost_intervention - Cost_baseline) / (QALY_intervention - QALY_baseline). Negative ICER indicates cost savings while improving health (dominant intervention).

**ROI (Return on Investment)**: Ratio of net benefits to costs. Calculated as NPV(Benefits) / NPV(Costs) for time-adjusted analysis, or Annual Benefits / Annual Costs for simple analysis.

**dFDA (Decentralized FDA)**: Proposed system for conducting clinical trials using real-world data, electronic health records, and decentralized patient participation. Reduces per-patient costs by 50-95% compared to traditional trials.

**DIH (Decentralized Institutes of Health)**: Proposed global research infrastructure funded by 1% of military spending reallocation, coordinating decentralized clinical trials and medical research.

**Peace Dividend**: Economic benefits from reduced military spending, including fiscal savings, reduced conflict-related economic damage, and favorable economic multiplier effects from reallocating resources to productive sectors.

**Dominant Intervention**: Health economics term for interventions that both reduce costs AND improve health outcomes. Unconditionally recommended regardless of willingness-to-pay thresholds (e.g., vaccination programs, smoking cessation).

**1% Treaty**: Proposed international agreement where signatory nations commit to reducing military expenditure by 1% and redirecting those funds ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} globally) to medical research infrastructure.

**Pragmatic Clinical Trial**: Trial design using real-world settings and broad eligibility criteria rather than highly controlled laboratory conditions. Reduces costs while improving generalizability (e.g., Oxford RECOVERY trial).
:::


**The Highest-ROI Public Health Intervention**

Shift 1% of global military spending into decentralized clinical trials. That's it. That's the entire plan.

## How It Actually Works

The mechanism is financial, not bureaucratic:

1. **Patient subsidies**: Most treaty funding ({{< var dih_treasury_trial_subsidies_annual >}}) goes directly to subsidizing patient participation in trials at ~{{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient - similar to how insurance covers medical procedures
2. **Providers get paid**: Treatment providers can charge for patient participation in trials, making trials profitable rather than costly
3. **Easy enrollment**: A streamlined FDA wrapper (costing just {{< var dfda_annual_opex >}}) makes it easy for anyone to create or join Phase 2/3/4 trials
4. **Patient choice**: Patients choose which trials to join; their subsidy follows them. Trials that attract patients get funded. No grant committees deciding what's "worthy."

This isn't "funding infrastructure" - it's making trial participation financially attractive for both patients and providers while removing regulatory friction.

## The Result:

- {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× faster medical progress
- Trillions saved annually
- Millions of unnecessary deaths prevented
- National security strengthened (by having 1% fewer things that explode)
- Financed entirely by greed

Humanity currently spends **{{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}} per year** on better ways to stop humans from living, and **{{< var global_med_research_spending >}} {{< var global_med_research_spending_cite >}} per year** on better ways to keep humans living.

That's a **{{< var military_vs_medical_research_ratio >}}:1 ratio**. 40 times more on creating corpses than preventing them. This seems like poor planning if your stated goal is "not dying."

To put this in perspective:

![Disease kills 18,274 times more people than terrorism](../../assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)

Disease kills **18,274 times more people** than terrorism, yet we spend vastly more on military responses to terrorism than on medical research. The threat we obsess over kills a rounding error compared to the threat we ignore.

The fix requires third-grade arithmetic:

**Move 1% of the “making corpses” budget into the “preventing corpses” budget.**

No new taxes. No cuts to healthcare or education. Zero trade-offs.

Just 1% less self-harm.


# The Result

**{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 to {{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 ROI**

(That's "impossible returns" to "mathematically absurd returns")

### Research Acceleration

{{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× faster medical progress (2,000 years of medical advancement in 20 years)

### Suffering Reduction

9.1 trillion hours of human suffering eliminated annually (the unnecessary kind)

### Life-Years Saved

20–60 million life-years saved per billion invested

### Annual Savings

{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} + $50–100B saved per year. Just appears. Like finding money in pants you're currently wearing.

These aren't projections. They're measurements:

* **Oxford RECOVERY** proved trials cost **{{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}× less** by using existing hospital infrastructure instead of dedicated trial sites
* This single trial enrolled 49,000 patients across 185 hospitals, found dexamethasone (reducing COVID deaths 33%), ruled out hydroxychloroquine, and identified effective treatments faster than traditional regulatory processes
* The bottleneck isn't scientific knowledge
* The bottleneck is requiring dedicated trial infrastructure when hospitals already exist

Medical progress currently flows through a coffee stirrer.
This makes it a fire hose.


# Why 1% Is Enough

### 1. The Peace Dividend

{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/year

Bombs are expensive. Breaking things costs money. Repairing broken things costs more money.
A 1% reduction in weapons procurement saves {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} annually.
That's roughly the GDP of Austria, just sitting there in the "please don't explode us" budget.

### 2. The Research Efficiency Dividend

{{< var dfda_rd_gross_savings_annual >}}–{{< var global_clinical_trial_market_annual >}} {{< var global_clinical_trial_market_annual_cite >}}

Traditional trials require:

* Dedicated trial sites with custom infrastructure (RECOVERY used existing hospitals)
* Extensive source data verification and monitoring visits (RECOVERY used routine medical records)
* Complex eligibility criteria excluding most patients (RECOVERY enrolled any hospitalized COVID patient)
* Detailed case report forms capturing hundreds of data points (RECOVERY collected <10 core outcomes)
* Years of site activation and regulatory approval per country (RECOVERY activated 185 sites in weeks)

Pragmatic trials skip this performance art entirely.
This is why costs drop **{{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}}×** instead of 2× or 5×.

### 3. 15–40 "NIH equivalents" of new research capacity

For the first time in human history, medical progress would advance **faster than disease progression**.
Currently, diseases are winning the race.
This reverses the score.


# And It Strengthens National Security

Here's the beautiful part: everyone reduces by 1% simultaneously.

## What doesn't change

* Power balances (everyone cuts equally)
* Deterrence (still plenty of weapons)
* Force ratios (relative strength identical)
* Strategic stability (same as before, just 1% less apocalyptic)
* Nuclear posture (can still end civilization 19 times instead of 20)

### What improves

* Fewer deployed warheads (less probability someone launches by mistake)
* Lower accidental-launch risk (fewer "oops, started WW3" scenarios)
* Reduced crisis instability (everyone's slightly less twitchy)
* Fewer weapons = fewer things that can catastrophically malfunction

It's like everyone agreeing to point 1% fewer guns at each other.
The threat stays balanced. The risk of everyone dying drops.

Game theorists call this "obvious."
Politicians call it "impossible."


# Why This Works: The Political Economy

Good ideas don't win because they're good.
They win by **aligning incentives**.

This is the alignment engine:


# Victory Bonds: The Greed-Aligned Engine

You make this happen by bribing people with their own future savings.

## Here's the mechanism

1. Investors buy **Victory Bonds**
2. Bond funds finance a lobbying campaign to redirect 1% of military spending
3. When the treaty passes, governments save hundreds of billions
4. A slice of those savings repays investors with absurd returns
5. Investors profit by funding the thing that makes them profit

It's **public choice theory applied correctly:**
Self-interest becomes a public good.

Nobody has to become a better person.
Nobody has to evolve morally.
They just follow their calculator to accidentally save humanity.

{{< include ../figures/victory-bonds-money-flow-diagram.qmd >}}

## Why Humans Will Do This

*For Every Type of Human*

**Defense Contractors**: "Keep 99% of your current budget AND get {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns on Victory Bonds. It's like finding money in pants you're currently wearing. Except the money multiplies. While you're wearing the pants."

**Insurance Companies**: "Healthy people file fewer claims than dead people. Dead people file zero claims, which sounds ideal until you realize they also pay zero premiums, creating a revenue problem. This fixes that."

**Pharmaceutical Companies**: "Instead of paying {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_example_48k >}} {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_example_48k_cite >}} per trial patient, patients bring {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} subsidies that YOU collect when they enroll. Your trial costs become revenue. We call it 'reverse expenses' or 'profit.'"

**Politicians**: "{{< var treaty_campaign_voting_bloc_target >}} million voters want this. Your opponent supports it. You can either agree or explain why you prefer bombs to grandma's cancer treatment."

**Billionaires**: "Your index fund makes 10% returns. Victory Bonds make {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}}. It's like compound interest discovered steroids then did cocaine."

**Regular Humans**: "Get subsidized to try experimental treatments your doctor recommends. Choose which trial to join - your {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} subsidy follows you. Your participation funds the trial; trials that attract patients get funded.  Also: **{{< var personal_lifetime_benefit_age_30_1pct >}} in lifetime wealth and {{< var personal_life_extension_years_age_30 >}} of life** from the economic multiplier effect ([see your personal benefits](../call-to-action/your-personal-benefits.qmd))."

Nobody has to evolve morally. Nobody has to become better people. You just point everyone's greed at diseases instead of each other.

# The Mechanical Sequence (How to Actually Do This)

This isn't utopian. It's a checklist:

### Step 1 — Run the Survey

Demonstrate overwhelming global support for medical acceleration over military acceleration.
Creates legitimacy. Generates media attention. Makes politicians nervous.

### Step 2 — Reach the Tipping Point

Hit {{< var global_population_activism_threshold_pct >}}

Social-movement science: **{{< var global_population_activism_threshold_pct >}} {{< var global_population_activism_threshold_pct_cite >}} committed support** reliably causes policy adoption.
This is the tipping point. Once you cross it, politicians follow or lose elections.

### Step 3 — Sell the Bonds

Victory Bond investors fund the campaign because the math is absurd.
They're buying $270+ in returns for every $100 invested.
It's the Louisiana Purchase of medical research.

### Step 4 — Run the Lobbying Campaign

Deploy Victory Bond funds to convince politicians that voters want this.
Standard lobbying tactics, just pointed at healing instead of killing.
Politicians discover they've "always cared deeply about medical research."

### Step 5 — Build the Infrastructure

The 1% shift funds globally scaled pragmatic trial infrastructure modeled on RECOVERY's approach.
Thousands of neglected treatments finally get tested.
Effective ones scale instantly.

**Technical requirements:** Building this requires EHR interoperability, data standards, automated analysis pipelines, and regulatory framework updates. RECOVERY demonstrated the core model works; scaling requires infrastructure investment but no fundamental technical breakthroughs. The challenge is deployment and adoption, not invention.

### Step 6 — Watch What Happens

- Medical progress accelerates {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}×
- Disease categories start collapsing
- Healthspan overtakes pathology
- Investors profit massively
- Governments save money
- Everyone becomes healthier, safer, richer

The plan works because **every step is economically rational for everyone involved**.
Nobody needs to be convinced. They just need to count.

**Implementation complexity:** Coordinating global treaty adoption, building technical infrastructure, and integrating with existing health systems presents significant logistical challenges. However, these are coordination problems with aligned incentives, not conflicts of interest. Similar to how nations coordinated on the Montreal Protocol (ozone layer) or the International Space Station despite complexity, the economic case makes cooperation rational even for self-interested actors.


# Why This Is the Dominant Strategy

If your goal is to maximize:

* Years humans spend alive and healthy (QALYs)
* Lifespan
* Productivity
* Economic growth
* National security
* Existential safety
* Not suffering unnecessarily

...then this isn't "a good policy."
It's the **mathematically dominant strategy**.

A $1B invested here generates more:

- Health
- Survival
- Stability
- Prosperity
- Innovation
- Safety

...than any other known use of $1B.

Not bed nets (excellent).
Not vaccines (incredible).
Not research grants (helpful).
Not climate interventions (necessary).
Not economic reforms (worthwhile).
Not AI safety (urgent).
Not other treaties (good luck).

All valuable. All recommended.
None offer **{{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× leverage**.


# The Math (Or: How to Prove Obvious Things to Skeptics)

Economists require elaborate rituals before believing simple truths like "curing diseases is better than bombing people." So here's the math they demanded.

This analysis uses three economic tools that sound complicated but aren't:

1. **Net Present Value (NPV)**: Future money is worth less than current money because humans are impatient
2. **Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs)**: A year of life spent healthy beats a year spent dying (economists needed a formula for this)
3. **Return on Investment (ROI)**: Money out divided by money in (this is apparently graduate-level economics)

The methodology follows standard health economics practices, except instead of making you more confused, I'll explain what the numbers mean.

## How Money Works When You Stop Wasting It

### Cost Side (What You Spend)

You spend {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} convincing humans that not dying is preferable to dying. This covers:

- Global referendum campaign to get 280M votes ({{< var treaty_campaign_budget_referendum >}})
- Professional democracy purchasers, previously employed corrupting government for weapons manufacturers, now corrupting government for medicine manufacturers ({{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}})
- Super PAC papers that make politicians care about living voters ({{< var treaty_campaign_budget_super_pacs >}})

This is a one-time cost. You either convince humanity to stop being stupid or you don't. There's no subscription model for common sense.

### Benefit Side (What Appears From The Void)

The treaty redirects {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually from the murder budget. This money already exists. You're not printing new money or raising taxes. You're just moving existing money from the "make humans stop existing" column to the "make humans continue existing" column.

This generates benefits through two mechanisms:

**1. You stop setting money on fire**

Military spending has economic multiplier effects of 0.5-1.0×. That means for every dollar spent on bombs, you get 50 cents to a dollar of economic value. Medical research has multiplier effects of 2.0-3.0×. For every dollar spent curing diseases, you get $2-3 of economic value.

Moving money from 0.5× returns to 2.0× returns is what economists call "not being stupid."

**2. You stop paying people to make trials cost 82 times too much**

Traditional FDA Phase 3 trials cost {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_fda_example_41k >}} {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_fda_example_41k_cite >}} per patient due to site setup costs, dedicated research staff, patient travel reimbursement, custom case report forms, and extensive monitoring requirements. The Oxford RECOVERY trial cost {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient by using existing hospital infrastructure, minimal additional data collection beyond standard care, and simplified consent processes.

That's an {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}}× cost reduction. Not through magic. Through the revolutionary process of "stop doing stupid things."

## The Return on Investment Equation

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{NPV(Benefits)}}{\text{NPV(Costs)}}
$$

In human language: "How much value do you get per dollar spent?"

**Conservative scenario** (only counting R&D efficiency, ignoring everything else):

{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only_latex >}}

You spend $1, you get ${{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}} back. This beats most legal activities.

**Complete scenario** (counting all the benefits your species will claim sound "too good"):

{{< var treaty_complete_roi_latex >}}

You spend $1 billion once, you get ${{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}} billion back every year, forever. Or until the sun explodes. Whichever happens first (probably the sun thing).

## Cost-Effectiveness: The "Per Life Saved" Metric

Health economists invented a metric called ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio):

$$
\text{ICER} = \frac{\Delta \text{Cost}}{\Delta \text{QALYs}} = \frac{C_{\text{intervention}} - C_{\text{baseline}}}{Q_{\text{intervention}} - Q_{\text{baseline}}}
$$

Translation: "How much does it cost per year of healthy life created?"

WHO says interventions under $50,000 per QALY are "cost-effective." Most successful health programs cost $3,000-10,000 per QALY.

This system's ICER: **{{< var dfda_icer_per_qaly >}} per QALY**

That's negative. Negative means you MAKE money while saving lives. Economists call this a "dominant intervention" because even they can't argue against it.

This approach doesn't cost money to save lives. It generates {{< var system_profit_per_life_saved >}} profit per life saved.

Traditional charity: "Please donate $3,500 to save one life"
This approach: "Here's ${{< var system_profit_per_life_saved >}}, we saved a life as a side effect of doing profitable things"

**Technical note**: This uses "net present value," which is economist code for "future money is worth less than current money" ({{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} discount rate). If you're into spreadsheets: [full NPV methodology here](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#calculation-framework---npv-methodology).

### The Detailed NPV Formulas (For Spreadsheet Enthusiasts)

For those who need to see the actual equations before believing anything:

#### NPV of Costs

$$
\text{NPV}(\text{Costs}) = C_{0} + \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{C_{\text{op}}(t)}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

where $C_{0}$ is upfront costs (platform development, legal structure, data integration), $C_{\text{op}}(t)$ is annual operating costs in year $t$ (maintenance, analysis, administration), $r$ is the discount rate ({{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}}), and $T$ is the time horizon ({{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years).

#### NPV of Benefits

Annual benefits $S(t)$ are calculated as:
$$
S(t) = p(t)\alpha R_{d}
$$

where $p(t)$ is the adoption rate at year $t$ (gradual ramp-up over {{< var dfda_npv_adoption_ramp_years >}} years), $\alpha$ is the fraction of R&D costs saved ({{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} baseline), and $R_{d}$ is annual global clinical trial spending ({{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual >}} {{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual_cite >}}).

The NPV of benefits:
$$
\text{NPV}(\text{Benefits}) = \sum_{t=1}^{T} \frac{S(t)}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

#### Return on Investment

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{NPV}(\text{Benefits})}{\text{NPV}(\text{Costs})}
$$

This yields the conservative estimate of {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI over {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years.

For the dFDA infrastructure (using annual figures):

{{< var dfda_icer_per_qaly_latex >}}

The negative ICER indicates cost savings while improving health, a **dominant intervention** by health economics standards. Standard willingness-to-pay thresholds are $50,000-{{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}} {{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd_cite >}} per QALY; interventions that save costs while gaining QALYs are unconditionally recommended.

## Quality-Adjusted Life Year (QALY) Valuation

QALYs represent the standard metric in health economics for comparing health interventions across different conditions and treatment modalities. One QALY equals one year of life in perfect health.

### QALY Calculation Model

The total annual QALY gain ({{< var global_dfda_qalys_gained_annual >}} QALYs baseline) derives from three distinct benefit streams:

**A. Accelerated Development of Existing Pipeline Drugs**

Health gains from bringing effective treatments to patients faster through shortened development and approval timelines:

- **Baseline:** Research shows one-year delays in cancer therapy diffusion resulted in 84,000 life-years lost
- **Estimate:** 2-year average acceleration across pharmaceutical pipeline
- **Annual QALYs:** 180,000-500,000 QALYs (baseline: 24% of total)

**B. Improved Preventative Care via Real-World Evidence**

Value of using comprehensive data to optimize preventative care and treatment effectiveness:

- **Baseline:** Cancer screenings alone have saved millions of life-years; significant untapped potential remains
- **Mechanism:** Large-scale identification of at-risk populations and real-world effectiveness measurement
- **Annual QALYs:** {{< var qalys_from_prevention_conservative >}}-{{< var qalys_from_prevention_optimistic >}} QALYs (baseline: 17% of total)

**C. Enabling Research for Previously Untreatable Diseases**

Transformative potential to create viable research pathways for conditions ignored due to high trial costs:

- **Baseline:** {{< var rare_diseases_count_global >}} {{< var rare_diseases_count_global_cite >}}+ rare diseases, {{< var dfda_trial_completion_rate >}} lack FDA-approved treatments
- **Mechanism:** Radically lower per-patient costs make rare disease R&D economically feasible
- **Annual QALYs:** {{< var qalys_from_new_therapies_conservative >}}-{{< var qalys_from_new_therapies_optimistic >}} QALYs (baseline: 60% of total)

**QALY Valuation:** Standard economic valuations range from $50,000-{{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}} {{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd_cite >}} per QALY. This analysis uses conservative mid-range values.

For detailed QALY calculation methodology, see [dFDA QALY Model](../appendix/dfda-qaly-model.qmd).

## Counterfactual Baseline Specification

This cost-effectiveness analysis uses the **status quo** as the baseline counterfactual: military spending continues at current levels ({{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}} annually) and is allocated to traditional military purposes. Under this baseline, the {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} redirected to medical research infrastructure would otherwise remain in military budgets.

**Alternative counterfactual scenarios** include:

1. **Military R&D continuation**: The {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} continues funding military research and development, potentially yielding civilian technology spillovers (e.g., GPS, internet protocols, materials science advances). This scenario is partially addressed in the peace dividend calculations, which acknowledge that military spending generates economic multiplier effects of 0.5-1.0× compared to medical research multipliers of 2.0-3.0×.

2. **Return to taxpayers**: Funds are returned via tax cuts, enabling private consumption and investment. Under this scenario, the opportunity cost equals the weighted average return on private capital (approximately {{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} annually in developed economies).

3. **Alternative government priorities**: Reallocation to other public investments such as infrastructure, education, or climate mitigation. Each alternative use would require separate cost-benefit analysis to determine relative efficiency.

**Methodological note on baseline selection**: The economically rigorous baseline is the "next best alternative use" rather than "status quo continuation." However, identifying the single next-best alternative requires comprehensive comparison across all possible uses of public funds, which exceeds the scope of this analysis. This analysis therefore focuses on the **conditional benefits of dFDA reallocation**: the health and economic gains achievable by redirecting {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} from military to medical research infrastructure.

**Conservative interpretation**: Even if alternative uses generate positive economic value, the dFDA infrastructure exhibits **dominant intervention** characteristics (negative ICER of {{< var dfda_icer_per_qaly >}} per QALY), indicating it saves costs while improving health outcomes. Under standard cost-effectiveness frameworks, dominant interventions are unconditionally recommended regardless of alternative uses, as they represent free gains in both dimensions (reduced costs and improved health).

## Peace Dividend Calculation Methodology

The peace dividend represents economic benefits from reduced military spending. The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty redirects {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military spending ({{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}} in 2024) = {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually.

### Economic benefits of reduced military spending

1. **Direct fiscal savings:** {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} available for productive investment
2. **Reduced conflict-related economic damage:** Historical analysis shows military spending reductions correlate with decreased trade disruption, infrastructure destruction, and refugee costs
3. **Economic multiplier effects:** Reallocation from military to medical research generates higher economic returns (medical research multiplier: 2.0-3.0×; military spending multiplier: 0.5-1.0×)

**Conservative estimate:** Analysis uses {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} annual peace dividend based on World Bank and IMF frameworks for economic benefits of reduced military expenditure.

For detailed calculations, see [Peace Dividend Analysis](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd).

**Confidence level separation**: The peace dividend calculation separates into two components with different levels of causal confidence:

1. **Direct fiscal savings (high confidence)**: {{< var peace_dividend_direct_fiscal_savings >}} - The 1% reduction in military budgets ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}) represents direct fiscal savings with high certainty. These funds are immediately available for reallocation regardless of conflict reduction effects.

2. **Conflict reduction benefits (lower confidence)**: {{< var peace_dividend_conflict_reduction >}} - The remaining {{< var peace_dividend_conflict_reduction >}} assumes that 1% less military spending correlates with 1% reduction in conflict costs (direct: $7.7T, indirect: $3.7T). This proportional relationship is a simplifying assumption without established causal evidence.

**Conservative interpretation**: The direct fiscal savings ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually) are certain; conflict reduction benefits ($0 to {{< var peace_dividend_conflict_reduction >}}) are uncertain and represent an optimistic scenario. The analysis uses the full {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} in optimistic/complete cases but acknowledges this may overstate benefits if the causal link between military spending and conflict is weaker than linear.

**Causal mechanism uncertainty**: The relationship between military spending and conflict is complex. Factors include deterrence effects (military strength may prevent conflicts), alliance structures, economic interdependence, and geopolitical stability. A 1% spending reduction may yield anywhere from 0% to >1% conflict reduction depending on context. Without instrumental variables or difference-in-differences analysis, the causal claim remains speculative.

## Research Acceleration Mechanism

The {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× research acceleration multiplier derives from specific, measurable improvements across four dimensions:

| Factor | Current System | dFDA System | Multiplier |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| **Recruitment Speed** | 6-18 months for 100 patients | 3 weeks for {{< var traditional_large_trial_size >}} {{< var traditional_large_trial_size_cite >}} patients | **25×** |
| **Trial Completion Speed** | 3-5 years | 3-12 months | **10×** |
| **Simultaneous Trials** | {{< var current_active_trials >}} {{< var current_active_trials_cite >}} active trials | {{< var dfda_active_trials >}} active trials | **20×** |
| **Completion Rate** | {{< var current_trials_per_year >}} {{< var current_trials_per_year_cite >}} finish | {{< var dfda_trial_completion_rate >}} finish | **1.6×** |
| **Funding Increase** | {{< var global_med_research_spending >}} {{< var global_med_research_spending_cite >}} baseline | {{< var total_research_funding_with_treaty >}} (baseline + {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}) | **1.4×** |

**Theoretical maximum:** 25 × 10 × 1.6 × 1.4 = 560×

**Conservative application:** Analysis uses {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× multiplier accounting for implementation constraints, regulatory requirements, and gradual adoption.

For detailed derivation, see [Research Acceleration Model](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd).

**Automated infrastructure, not researcher scaling**: The dFDA system operates as automated infrastructure analyzing time-series EHR data from electronic health records, wearables, and apps, similar to how Amazon provides infrastructure for e-commerce or Consumer Reports for product testing. The {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× research acceleration does **not** require {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× more researchers because the system scales through software and data infrastructure, not human labor.

The platform uses federated queries (data stays in Epic/Cerner/Apple Health systems) rather than centralized databases, enabling analysis without data movement. Physicians continue normal clinical practice; the platform automatically detects patterns, identifies treatment effects, and flags signals for peer review. This is fundamentally different from traditional research models that scale linearly with researcher headcount.

## Sensitivity Analysis Approach

The analysis employs comprehensive sensitivity testing across multiple scenarios to assess robustness of findings:

**Conservative Scenario ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI):**

- R&D cost reduction: {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}}
- QALY gains: {{< var qalys_total_conservative >}} annually
- Adoption timeline: {{< var dfda_npv_adoption_ramp_years >}} years to full adoption
- Includes only R&D efficiency savings (excludes peace dividend and six additional benefit categories)

### Worst-Case Scenario (66:1 ROI)

- Benefits half as good as baseline
- Costs twice as high as baseline
- Extended adoption timeline
- Regulatory barriers and implementation delays

**Optimistic Scenario ({{< var optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 ROI):**

- R&D cost reduction: {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} (RECOVERY trial-like efficiency)
- QALY gains: {{< var qalys_total_optimistic >}} annually
- Faster adoption and broader scope

**Complete Case ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 ROI):**

- Includes all eight quantifiable benefit categories
- Peace dividend: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}
- Earlier treatment access, research acceleration, rare disease treatments, drug price reductions, prevention medicine, mental health benefits

Sensitivity analysis demonstrates robust returns across all scenarios, with ROI ranging from {{< var conservative_scenario_roi >}}:1 (worst-case) to {{< var optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 (optimistic). See [1% Treaty Cost-Effectiveness Analysis](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) for detailed scenario modeling.

**Probabilistic sensitivity analysis:** Instead of just testing a few scenarios (worst-case, conservative, optimistic), we ran 10,000 simulations where each uncertain parameter was randomly sampled from probability distributions. This tells us not just "what if X happens" but "what's the range of likely outcomes given all the uncertainty."

**What we varied:** Cost reduction (50-95%), political success probability (5-60%), adoption timeline (3-8 years), discount rate (1-7%), and QALY gains (0.7-1.3× baseline).

#### Results

- **If implementation succeeds** (conditional ROI): 95% of simulations fall between 44:1 and 66:1 ROI, with median 54:1. This means even with all the uncertainty, if the treaty passes, returns are almost certainly between 44:1 and 66:1.
- **Accounting for political risk** (expected ROI): 95% of simulations fall between 2.7:1 and 27:1 ROI, with median 14:1. This incorporates the probability that the treaty might not pass, even with that risk, expected returns are still 2.7:1 to 27:1.

**Economic interpretation:** ROI > 1:1 means benefits exceed costs. All 10,000 simulations produced ROI > 1:1, meaning there is zero probability (within the modeled uncertainty) that this intervention loses money. Even the worst-case scenario (5th percentile expected ROI of 2.7:1) generates 2.7× more value than cost. This qualifies as a **dominant intervention** in health economics: it should be implemented regardless of budget constraints, as it generates net economic surplus while improving health outcomes.

This probabilistic analysis complements the scenario-based sensitivity analysis above, providing confidence intervals rather than point estimates.

{{< include ../figures/monte-carlo-roi-distribution-chart.qmd >}}

### Discount Rate Sensitivity

The baseline analysis uses a {{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} annual discount rate (standard for long-term public health investments). NPV calculations are sensitive to this critical parameter:

**ROI sensitivity to discount rate**:

| Discount Rate | ROI (dFDA Only) | Interpretation |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **1%** | {{< var roi_discount_1pct >}}:1 | Low discount rate (very long-term view) |
| **3% (baseline)** | {{< var roi_discount_3pct >}}:1 | Standard public health discount rate |
| **5%** | {{< var roi_discount_5pct >}}:1 | Higher discount rate (private sector typical) |
| **7%** | {{< var roi_discount_7pct >}}:1 | High discount rate (short-term focus) |

**Formula**: Higher discount rates reduce NPV of future benefits:

$$
\text{NPV} = \sum_{t=1}^{10} \frac{B_t - C_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

where $r$ is the discount rate, $B_t$ are benefits in year $t$, and $C_t$ are costs in year $t$.

**Key insight**: Even at 7% discount rate (high by public health standards), ROI remains {{< var roi_discount_7pct >}}:1, substantially exceeding alternative interventions. The {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}}-year horizon captures the majority of NPV; benefits continue beyond year {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} but are discounted heavily.

**Benefit timing**: Peace dividend is immediate (year 1), R&D savings ramp gradually (years 1-5), QALY gains are long-term (years 5-20+). Front-loaded benefits (peace dividend) are less sensitive to discount rate than back-loaded benefits (QALYs).

## Key Analytical Assumptions

This analysis rests on several core assumptions that should be made explicit for academic transparency:

### Strategic Stability Assumption

**Assumption:** A coordinated {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} reduction in military spending across all nations maintains relative power balances and strategic deterrence capabilities.

**Justification:** The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty explicitly requires proportional reductions from all signatories. Since relative military capabilities remain unchanged, strategic stability is preserved. Historical analysis shows that symmetric reductions in military tensions (e.g., START treaties, naval treaties between world wars) maintained deterrence while reducing absolute expenditure.

**Sensitivity:** This assumption is critical to the peace dividend calculation. Alternative scenarios modeling unilateral reductions would require different political economy frameworks.

### Linear Scaling Assumption

**Assumption:** Economic benefits and costs scale approximately linearly with program scope and adoption rates.

**Justification:** Conservative assumption that costs scale with system usage. Research acceleration benefits may exhibit superlinear returns (network effects, data abundance), making this assumption conservative.

**Sensitivity:** Tested through worst-case ({{< var conservative_scenario_roi >}}:1 ROI) and optimistic ({{< var optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 ROI) scenarios spanning benefits 50% lower to 5× higher than baseline.

### Adoption Rate Assumptions

**Assumption:** dFDA achieves gradual adoption following a {{< var dfda_npv_adoption_ramp_years >}}-year linear ramp to 50%-80% participation rate among eligible trials.

**Conservative case:** 50% of trials adopt dFDA methodology
**Optimistic case:** 80% adoption rate

**Justification:** Based on historical adoption curves for electronic health records (5-10 years to majority adoption), clinical trial registry systems, and FDA Sentinel System implementation.

**Adoption realism considerations:** Technology adoption typically follows S-curve dynamics with critical mass thresholds rather than linear ramps. Coordination failure risk exists (prisoner's dilemma: pharmaceutical companies may prefer others adopt first). Mitigation: Economic incentives (82× cost reduction) create overwhelming financial motivation for early adoption. Regulatory harmonization across jurisdictions may extend to 10-20 years rather than the modeled 5-year timeline, though pilot programs in willing jurisdictions (UK MHRA, which accepted RECOVERY evidence) can establish proof-of-concept earlier.

**Sensitivity:** NPV calculations explicitly model adoption uncertainty through gradual ramp-up rather than immediate full adoption. Conservative scenario (50% adoption) accounts for coordination failures and regulatory delays.

### Cost Reduction Assumptions

**Assumption:** dFDA methodology reduces per-patient trial costs by {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} (conservative) to 95% (optimistic) compared to traditional randomized controlled trials.

#### Empirical basis

- Oxford RECOVERY trial: {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}}× cost reduction ({{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient vs. {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_cite >}} traditional)
- ADAPTABLE trial: Similar cost structure using pragmatic design
- Literature on pragmatic trials consistently shows 50-95% cost reductions

**Sensitivity:** Conservative scenario ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI) uses {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} reduction; optimistic case uses 95%.

### Historical Precedent: Pre-1962 Physician-Led Efficacy Trials

**Context:** The decentralized FDA approach is not an untested innovation extrapolated from a single case study (RECOVERY trial). Rather, it represents a return to the physician-led, real-world evidence model that operated successfully from 1883 to 1960 before being replaced by the current centralized system.

**Cost structure comparison demonstrates dramatic efficiency difference:**

- **Pre-1962 system**: [$74 million per drug](../references.qmd#pre-1962-drug-costs-timeline) (2024 inflation-adjusted) for safety testing; efficacy determined through decentralized physician case reports
- **Post-1962 system**: $2.6 billion per drug average, a **35× cost increase**; drug companies conduct both safety and efficacy trials internally
- **dFDA model**: Return to decentralized physician-led efficacy testing with modern automation (electronic health records, AI-assisted analysis, real-time data aggregation), targeting **50-95% cost reductions**

![Drug development costs exploded after 1962 regulations](../../assets/cost-to-develop-a-new-drug.png)

The cost explosion began exactly when efficacy testing was centralized within pharmaceutical companies. This wasn't a natural evolution of drug development - it was a regulatory mandate that increased costs 35-fold while slowing innovation.

#### Historical operational model

From 1883 to 1960, [144,000 physicians](../references.qmd#pre-1962-physician-trials) across America tested drug efficacy on real patients in routine clinical practice. The [Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)](../references.qmd#jama-founded-1893) compiled these observational reports, leading medical experts peer-reviewed the aggregated data, and effective treatments received endorsement. This decentralized, pragmatic trial system coincided with dramatic improvements in life expectancy during the early-to-mid 20th century.

![Life expectancy was flat for 10,000 years, then exploded starting in 1883](../../assets/life-expectancy-historical.jpg)

Human life expectancy remained essentially unchanged from the Bronze Age through 1883. Then something unprecedented happened: organized medical research began, physicians started systematically testing treatments, and life expectancy doubled within 80 years. This dramatic acceleration occurred under the decentralized physician-led model (1883-1960), not the centralized pharmaceutical trial system that replaced it after 1962.

**Safety record, the thalidomide success story:** Critically, the pre-1962 safety testing framework successfully prevented the [thalidomide disaster](../references.qmd#thalidomide-no-us-birth-defects) that devastated Europe with [thousands of horrific birth defects](../references.qmd#thalidomide-birth-defects). When thalidomide was marketed in Europe starting in 1957 for morning sickness, existing FDA safety regulations (1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act) blocked the drug from approval in the United States. **Zero American babies were harmed**, the safety testing framework worked exactly as intended.

The 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendment added extensive efficacy requirements *in response to thalidomide*, despite the fact that the US had already been fully protected by existing safety regulations. The problem was not insufficient regulation, safety testing had succeeded. The response was to take efficacy testing away from 144,000 independent physicians and centralize it within pharmaceutical companies, increasing costs 35-fold while slowing approvals substantially.

**Current system deterioration:** Life expectancy in the United States has declined in recent years (2014-2017, 2020-2021), the first sustained decreases since 1915-1918, suggesting the post-1962 regulatory model may have reached diminishing or negative returns.

#### Implications for generalizability

The RECOVERY trial ({{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient) demonstrates that modern infrastructure enables even greater efficiency than the pre-1962 system. However, the fundamental approach, physicians testing treatments on real patients in clinical practice settings, has nearly 80 years of empirical validation (1883-1960), not merely one case study.

The cost reduction estimates (50-95%) are conservative relative to the historical 97%+ reduction achieved by the pre-1962 model ($74M vs. $2.6B). Modern technology (EHRs, wearables, automated data collection) suggests efficiency gains could exceed historical precedent while maintaining the safety protections that successfully prevented disasters like thalidomide.

### Political Feasibility Assumption

**Assumption:** The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty achieves ratification by sufficient nations within a 3-5 year campaign timeline.

**Justification:** Historical treaty adoption timelines vary (Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: 3 years; Paris Climate Agreement: 5 years). This analysis focuses on economic value *conditional* on implementation, not probability of political success.

**Important caveat:** This analysis does not model the probability distribution over political outcomes. The economic case ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 to {{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 ROI) holds *if implemented*, but political economy barriers to implementation are substantial and outside the scope of this cost-benefit analysis.

### Expected Value Analysis Accounting for Political Risk

**Standard economic practice**: Cost-benefit analysis for interventions with implementation uncertainty requires expected value calculation:

$$
E[\text{ROI}] = P(\text{success}) \times \text{ROI}_{\text{if successful}}
$$

The preceding analysis presents *conditional* benefits (returns IF implementation succeeds). Expected value analysis incorporates the probability of achieving political ratification and sustained commitment:

**Expected ROI sensitivity to political success probability**:

{{< include ../figures/expected-roi-political-probability-column-chart.qmd >}}

| Political Success Probability | Expected ROI (dFDA Only) | Interpretation |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **10% (Conservative)** | {{< var expected_roi_conservative_dfda >}}:1 | Low confidence in treaty ratification |
| **25% (Moderate)** | {{< var expected_roi_moderate_dfda >}}:1 | Historical treaty adoption baseline |
| **40% (Moderate-High)** | 185:1 | Favorable political conditions |
| **50% (Optimistic)** | {{< var expected_roi_optimistic_dfda >}}:1 | Strong international coordination |

**Key insight**: Even with conservative 10% success probability, expected ROI of {{< var expected_roi_conservative_dfda >}}:1 substantially exceeds typical public health interventions (which have P≈1.0 but ROI of 10-30:1).

**Comparison to traditional interventions** (assuming 100% implementation probability):

- Childhood vaccination programs: {{< var childhood_vaccination_roi >}} {{< var childhood_vaccination_roi_cite >}}:1 ROI with P≈1.0
- Against Malaria Foundation: ~8:1 equivalent ROI
- **1% Treaty (P=10%)**: {{< var expected_roi_conservative_dfda >}}:1 expected ROI
- **1% Treaty (P=25%)**: {{< var expected_roi_moderate_dfda >}}:1 expected ROI

**Interpretation**: The high conditional ROI ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1) means that even modest implementation probabilities yield expected values competitive with best-in-class health interventions that have near-certain implementation.

**Note**: This analysis uses point estimates for political probability. Actual probability depends on campaign execution, geopolitical conditions, and public support mobilization. The [campaign strategy](campaign-budget.qmd) allocates {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} over 4 years specifically to maximize ratification probability.

### Time Inconsistency and Commitment Credibility

**Political economy challenge**: Even if the treaty achieves initial ratification, sustained commitment over the {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}}-year analytical horizon faces time inconsistency problems. Political business cycles (2-6 year terms) create incentives to raid the medical research budget for short-term priorities.

**Concentrated costs, diffuse benefits**: Defense contractors have concentrated interests with substantial lobbying capacity ({{< var defense_lobbying_annual >}} {{< var defense_lobbying_annual_cite >}} annually). Health benefits, while larger in aggregate ({{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} annually), are diffuse across millions of beneficiaries. Olson's logic of collective action predicts that concentrated interests will resist more effectively than diffuse beneficiaries will mobilize, creating political economy barriers to sustained implementation.

**Historical precedent - Post-WWII peace dividend**: The post-World War II "peace dividend" saw military spending fall from 37% of GDP (1945) to 5% (1948), with expectations of permanent reductions. However, the Cold War reversed this within 3 years. Military spending returned to 13% of GDP by 1953. Similar patterns occurred post-Vietnam and post-Cold War: initial reductions followed by reversals within 5-10 years.

**Treaty ratification ≠ sustained funding**: The Paris Climate Agreement provides a cautionary example: 196 parties ratified, but many failed to meet funding commitments. As of 2024, developed countries have not met the $100B annual climate finance pledge despite treaty obligations. Treaty ratification creates moral commitment but weak enforcement mechanisms for sustained budgetary allocations.

**Implication for expected value**: The political success probabilities used in expected value analysis (10%-50%) implicitly incorporate time inconsistency risk. A treaty might ratify with P=50% but maintain funding for {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years with P=25%. The expected value analysis partially addresses this through probability discounting, but time inconsistency (commitment erosion over time) represents an additional risk factor beyond initial political feasibility.

**Potential commitment mechanisms** (not modeled):

- Constitutional amendment (very high barrier, very high credibility)
- Independent funding agency with statutory protections
- Lock-box mechanism with supermajority requirement to redirect funds
- International monitoring and reputation costs
- Public transparency: all spending and trial outcomes publicly auditable

**Note**: The analysis acknowledges this limitation. Results should be interpreted as conditional on sustained implementation, with expected value analysis providing probability-adjusted estimates that partially account for political risk.

### Technology Constancy Assumption

**Assumption:** Analysis does not incorporate potential advances in AI, automation, or biotechnology that could further accelerate research.

**Justification:** Conservative assumption. Emerging AI capabilities in drug discovery, automated synthesis, and computational biology could dramatically increase research productivity beyond modeled estimates.

**Implication:** Baseline estimates likely underestimate long-term benefits by excluding technology-driven accelerations.

### Data Quality and Availability

All primary data sources are documented in [References](../references.qmd) with confidence levels:

- **High confidence** (78%): SIPRI military expenditure, WHO mortality statistics, ClinicalTrials.gov data
- **Medium confidence** (17%): Peace dividend estimates, QALY valuations (wide range in literature)
- **Conservative bounds**: Where uncertainty exists, analysis uses conservative estimates favoring underestimation of benefits

For complete parameter documentation with confidence indicators and peer-review status, see [Parameters and Calculations Reference](../appendix/parameters-and-calculations.qmd).


# The Conservative Case: dFDA Only

{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI

This is the floor. The "what if we're wrong about everything" scenario.

Count only R&D savings from cheaper trials. Ignore peace dividends, earlier drug access, and everything else that makes skeptics nervous.

### The Math

Simple ROI calculation:

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Benefits}}{\text{Costs}} = \frac{\$249.3\text{B}}{\$538\text{M}} = 463:1
$$

You spend {{< var dfda_npv_total_cost >}}.
You get back {{< var dfda_npv_net_benefit_conservative >}} over {{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years.

That's $463 appearing for every $1 you invest. It's like a money printer, except instead of causing inflation, it causes people to continue existing.

**Technical note**: This uses "net present value," which is economist code for "future money is worth less than current money" ({{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} discount rate). If you're into spreadsheets: [full NPV methodology here](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#calculation-framework---npv-methodology).

### Where the Money Comes From

{{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military budgets gets redirected. This gives you:

- **Funding**: {{< var global_annual_human_cost_state_violence >}}/year to spend on not-dying
- **Bonus savings**: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/year in economic value from building 1% fewer things that explode

The peace dividend math is simple: wars cost {{< var global_annual_war_total_cost >}}/year. {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} less war costs {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} less money.

| **[Lost Human Capital](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | {{< var global_annual_lost_human_capital_conflict >}} {{< var global_annual_lost_human_capital_conflict_cite >}} | Productive capacity lost from casualties and displacement |
| **Total War Costs** | **{{< var global_annual_war_total_cost >}}** | Combined direct and indirect annual costs |
| **1% Reduction** | **{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}** | Peace dividend from 1% treaty implementation |

This calculation methodology follows standard cost-of-conflict analysis frameworks used by the World Bank, IMF, and academic conflict economics research. See [Peace Dividend Calculations](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) for detailed sources and methodology.

**Note on confidence levels**: The direct military spending reduction ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}) has high confidence. The remaining conflict cost reductions assume proportional scaling (1% military spending → 1% conflict reduction) which lacks empirical validation. Conservative scenarios should use only direct fiscal savings; optimistic scenarios can include full peace dividend effects.

{{< include ../figures/peace-dividend-breakdown-bar-chart.qmd >}}

### How Treaty Funding Is Allocated

**Total annual treaty funding**: {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}

The vast majority goes to **patient subsidies** (~$24.4B), with minimal overhead:

1. **Patient Trial Subsidies** (89.8%): {{< var dih_treasury_trial_subsidies_annual >}}/year
   - Subsidizes {{< var dih_patients_fundable_annually >}} patients annually at {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient
   - Patients bring subsidies to trials; providers collect payment when patients enroll
   - Makes trial participation profitable for providers instead of costly

2. **Victory Bond Payouts** (10%): {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year to campaign investors

3. **Coordination Platform** (0.15%): {{< var dfda_annual_opex >}}/year for decentralized FDA infrastructure

**Why platform costs are low:** Decentralized FDA infrastructure provides coordination protocols (like HTTP for the internet), not a competing platform.

The infrastructure already exists. Epic, Cerner, Medable, Science 37 have built the components. A decentralized FDA protocol creates the coordination layer that makes them work together for clinical trials.

Data stays federated (in Epic/Cerner/Apple Health systems). No massive centralized database. No billion-dollar infrastructure. Just coordination protocols.

For detailed cost breakdown: [Platform Costs](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#dfda-platform-costs---rom-estimates-partnership-model).

**Key insight**: 90% of treaty funding goes directly to patients and providers as trial participation subsidies. Platform overhead is minimal ($40M) compared to patient subsidies ($24.4B).

This assumes gradual rollout (0% to {{< var peace_dividend_environmental >}} over {{< var dfda_npv_adoption_ramp_years >}} years). Full breakdown: [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#costs-of-building-and-operating-the-global-decentralized-fda-rom-estimate).

### What You Get Back

- **Money**: {{< var dfda_npv_net_benefit_conservative >}} in R&D savings ({{< var npv_time_horizon_years >}} years)
- **Returns**: {{< var dfda_npv_net_benefit_conservative >}} ÷ {{< var dfda_npv_total_cost >}} = **{{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1** ([full analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd))
- **Not dying**: {{< var global_dfda_qalys_gained_annual >}} quality-adjusted life years annually

**Two money fountains from one budget shift**:

1. **Peace dividend**: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/year (from building 1% fewer things that explode)
2. **Research efficiency**: {{< var dfda_rd_gross_savings_annual >}}/year (from not requiring PhDs to document paperwork about paperwork for {{< var treatment_acceleration_years_current >}} {{< var treatment_acceleration_years_current_cite >}} years)

**Combined**: {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}}/year

And this is the *conservative* case that ignores faster drug access, better treatment selection, reduced adverse events, and every other benefit that sounds "too good."

**Worst-case check**: If costs double and benefits halve (everything goes catastrophically wrong), you still get {{< var conservative_scenario_roi >}}:1 to {{< var optimistic_scenario_roi >}}:1 returns. [Full sensitivity analysis](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd).

{{< include ../figures/dfda-roi-sensitivity-analysis-column-chart.qmd >}}

### Cost-Effectiveness: Dominant Health Intervention

Most health interventions require ongoing funding. This one generates profit while saving lives.

In health economics, that's called a **dominant intervention** - simultaneously reducing costs while improving health outcomes. It's rare. The last one this good was smallpox eradication.

#### Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)

ICER measures how much you pay per year of healthy life gained (QALY):

$$
\text{ICER} = \frac{\Delta \text{Cost}}{\Delta \text{QALYs}} = \frac{C_{\text{intervention}} - C_{\text{baseline}}}{Q_{\text{intervention}} - Q_{\text{baseline}}}
$$

For the dFDA (using annual figures):

$$
\text{ICER} = \frac{\text{Net Incremental Cost}}{\text{QALYs Gained}} = \frac{-\$49.96\text{B}}{840{,}000 \text{ QALYs}} = -\$59{,}476 \text{ per QALY}
$$

**Translation:** You GAIN $59,476 for every year of healthy life you save.

Normally, you *spend* money to save lives. Good interventions cost $50,000-$150,000 per QALY. Great interventions cost $3,000-$50,000.

This one *makes* $59,476 per QALY while saving the life.

It's backwards. The number is negative. Economists call this "dominant" because you don't have to choose between "saving money" and "saving lives." You do both.

**For comprehensive ICER analysis including sensitivity analysis across multiple scenarios, alternative funding perspectives, and detailed methodology**, see [dFDA ICER Analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#dfda-icer-analysis---cost-utility-framework).

#### Comparative Cost per Life Saved

- **[Against Malaria Foundation](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)**: {{< var givewell_cost_per_life_min >}} {{< var givewell_cost_per_life_min_cite >}} cost per life saved (GiveWell top charity)
- **[Deworm the World Initiative](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)**: {{< var givewell_cost_per_life_max >}} {{< var givewell_cost_per_life_max_cite >}} cost per life saved (highly cost-effective intervention)
- **{{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty/dFDA System**: {{< var cost_per_life_investor_funded >}} [net societal benefit](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) per life saved (dominant intervention)

The negative cost (net benefit) per life saved distinguishes this as a dominant intervention in health economics terminology, an intervention that both reduces costs and improves outcomes, with no trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness.

### Self-Funding Mechanism Through Military Budget Redirection

{{< include ../figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty financing structure creates a self-funding system requiring zero net new spending from donors or taxpayers.

**Economic Structure** ([see detailed calculation](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)):

- **Funding Source**: {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually from {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} [redirection of existing military budgets](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) (money already allocated in national budgets)

**Funding Allocation**:

1. **Victory Bond Payouts**: {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year to investors who funded the campaign
2. **dFDA Platform Operations**: {{< var dfda_annual_opex >}}/year for core infrastructure
3. **Patient Trial Subsidies**: {{< var dih_treasury_trial_subsidies_annual >}}/year subsidizing patient participation in clinical trials
   - At {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient ([RECOVERY trial cost](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd)), this funds {{< var dih_patients_fundable_annually >}} patients annually
   - Patients choose which trials to join; trials that attract patients get funded
   - **ALL remaining funds go to patient subsidies** - no separate bureaucracy or overhead budget

- **Annual Benefits**: {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} (Peace dividend: {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} + R&D savings: {{< var dfda_rd_gross_savings_annual >}})
- **Operating Costs**: {{< var treaty_total_annual_costs >}} annually (campaign operations and dFDA infrastructure)
- **Net Position**: {{< var treaty_total_annual_benefits >}} annual surplus after all costs
- **Lives Saved**: {{< var treaty_total_lives_saved_annual >}} annually

$$
1{,}162{,}000 \text{ QALYs} \div 44 \text{ QALYs/life} = 26{,}446 \text{ lives}
$$

- **Cost per Life Saved**: Net societal benefit of `{python} cost_per_life_investor_funded_formatted` per life ([negative cost](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) indicates net profit)

This financing structure classifies the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty as a **dominant health intervention** using standard health economics terminology, an intervention with both lower costs and better health outcomes than the status quo, requiring no trade-off between cost-effectiveness and impact.

The self-funding nature eliminates traditional barriers to scale, as the intervention generates sufficient economic surplus to sustain and expand operations without ongoing charitable contributions.

# The Complete Case: All Direct Benefits

{{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 ROI

The conservative {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 case counted only R&D efficiency gains.

Now let's include all eight quantifiable benefit categories.

### Annual Benefits Breakdown

{{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual >}} in total annual benefits

Eight measurable benefit streams:

1. **Peace dividend** ({{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}) - Building 1% fewer things that explode
2. **R&D cost savings** ({{< var dfda_rd_gross_savings_annual >}}) - Trials cost {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}}× less
3. **Faster access** ({{< var benefit_earlier_drug_access_annual >}}) - Treatments arrive 7 years earlier
4. **Research acceleration** ({{< var benefit_medical_research_acceleration_annual >}}) - {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× more trials = 10-20× more breakthroughs
5. **Rare diseases** ({{< var benefit_rare_diseases_annual >}}) - [300M patients](../references.qmd#rare-disease-patients-300m-globally) with diseases too rare to be profitable suddenly become treatable
6. **Drug price drops** ({{< var benefit_drug_price_reduction_annual >}}) - U.S. pays {{< var us_drug_price_multiplier_vs_peer_countries >}} {{< var us_drug_price_multiplier_vs_peer_countries_cite >}}× what other countries pay; competition fixes that
7. **Prevention** ({{< var benefit_prevention_annual >}}) - Preventing disease becomes economically viable
8. **Mental health** ({{< var benefit_mental_health_annual >}}) - Partial closure of {{< var sensitivity_peace_dividend_optimistic >}} funding gap

#### Total annual benefits

{{< var treaty_complete_case_annual_benefits_latex >}}

That's **$1.2 trillion per year**.

#### Complete Case ROI

{{< var treaty_complete_roi_latex >}}

**Translation:** Every $1 invested returns $1,239 in benefits annually, or $12,386 over a decade.

These estimates derive from:

- Proven trial costs ([RECOVERY](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd): 82× cost reduction demonstrated)
- Disease prevalence data (WHO Global Health Observatory)
- Standard QALY valuations (health economics consensus thresholds)

**Critical distinction** - the two largest benefits are different things:

- **Faster Access** = Same treatments, 7 years earlier (access existing drugs during trials)
- **Research Acceleration** = {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× more trials, 10-20× more discoveries (find new cures faster)

Both happen simultaneously.

### Research Acceleration Mechanism

The {{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}× research acceleration multiplier is derived from specific, measurable improvements across four dimensions, scaling the RECOVERY trial approach globally:

**Current System Baseline**:

- {{< var current_trials_per_year >}} {{< var current_trials_per_year_cite >}} clinical trials initiated per year
- [60% completion rate](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) = **{{< var current_completed_trials_per_year >}} completed trials/year**
- {{< var current_active_trials >}} {{< var current_active_trials_cite >}} active trials at any time (3-5 year duration)
- {{< var current_patient_eligibility_rate >}} {{< var current_patient_eligibility_rate_cite >}} patient eligibility (5M trial slots for [2.4B people with chronic disease](../references.qmd#disease-prevalence-2-billion))
- {{< var current_trial_abandonment_rate >}} {{< var current_trial_abandonment_rate_cite >}} abandonment rate (studies never complete)
- [6-18 months to recruit 100 patients](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)

**Pragmatic Trial System Performance** (RECOVERY model scaled globally):

- {{< var dfda_trials_per_year_capacity >}} trials/year capacity
- [95% completion rate](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) = **{{< var dfda_completed_trials_per_year >}} completed trials/year**
- {{< var dfda_active_trials >}} active trials at any time (3-12 month duration)
- {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} patient eligibility ([1.2B eligible](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) with minimal exclusions)
- {{< var dfda_trial_abandonment_rate >}} abandonment rate (patient subsidies flip economic incentives)
- 3 weeks to recruit {{< var traditional_large_trial_size >}} {{< var traditional_large_trial_size_cite >}} patients (RECOVERY achieved this enrollment speed)

**Multiplier Derivation**:

| Factor | Current | Pragmatic Trials | Multiplier |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|
| **[Recruitment Speed](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** | 6-18 months for 100 patients | 3 weeks for {{< var traditional_large_trial_size >}} {{< var traditional_large_trial_size_cite >}} patients | **[25x](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |
| **[Trial Completion Speed](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** | 3-5 years (perverse incentives) | 3-12 months (aligned incentives) | **[10x](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |
| **[Simultaneous Trials](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** | 10,000 active trials | 200,000 active trials | **[20x](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |
| **[Completion Rate](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** | 60% finish | 95% finish | **[1.6x](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |
| **Funding Increase** | [$67.5B medical research](../appendix/global-government-medical-research-spending.qmd) | [$94.7B](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) ($67.5B + {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}) | **[1.4x](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)** |

**Theoretical Maximum**:

$$
25 \times 10 \times 1.6 \times 1.4 = 560
$$

This represents **{{< var completed_trials_multiplier_theoretical_max >}}** more completed trials per year

**Conservative Estimate**: {{< var completed_trials_multiplier_actual >}} accounting for real-world friction (ramp-up, adoption, learning curves)

**Used in Analysis**: **{{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}** (further conservative adjustment for foundation grant proposal credibility)

This represents:

- From {{< var current_completed_trials_per_year >}} completed trials/year → [227,700 completed trials/year](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd) ({{< var research_acceleration_multiplier >}}x)
- From [50 drug approvals/year](../references.qmd#global-new-drug-approvals-50-annually) → 1,000-{{< var dfda_drug_approvals_per_year_high >}} approvals/year (20-40x)
- From [$41,000 cost per patient](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) → {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}}-1,000 cost per patient ([82x cost reduction](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd), proven by Oxford RECOVERY trial)

# Personal Economic Impact: From Societal to Individual

The aggregate societal benefits ({{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}}-{{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual >}} annually) result from individual economic gains multiplied across billions of people. Understanding individual impact helps explain both the scale and the equity of the Disease Eradication Model.

{{< include ../figures/disease-eradication-annual-benefits-stacked-area-chart.qmd >}}

For detailed analysis of personal wealth calculations, see [Disease Eradication Model: Personal Lifetime Wealth](../appendix/disease-eradication-personal-lifetime-wealth-calculations.qmd).

# Problem Statement

### Current Resource Allocation

Humanity's budget priorities, explained simply:

- **Military spending**: {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}}/year (ending life)
- **Medical research**: {{< var global_med_research_spending >}} {{< var global_med_research_spending_cite >}} /year (extending life)
- **Ratio**: {{< var military_vs_medical_research_ratio >}}:1 (you spend {{< var military_vs_medical_research_ratio >}}× more on creating corpses than preventing them)

#### Disease treatment vs. curing disease

- **Symptomatic treatment**: {{< var global_symptomatic_disease_treatment_annual >}} {{< var global_symptomatic_disease_treatment_annual_cite >}}/year (managing symptoms, not fixing root causes)
- **Disease burden**: {{< var global_disease_economic_burden_annual >}}/year in lost productivity, premature death, disability
- **Curative research**: {{< var global_med_research_spending >}} {{< var global_med_research_spending_cite >}} billion/year

That's 0.053% of the disease burden spent on actually fixing the problem:

$$
\frac{\$68\text{B}}{\$128.6\text{T}} = 0.053\%
$$

#### Results of this strategy

- Diseases eradicated in past 50 years: **Zero** ([smallpox was 1980](../references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated))
- Military vs. medical research: **40:1** ratio

It's like spending $40 on gasoline for a fire and $1 on a fire extinguisher.

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y title="President Eisenhower's Farewell Address - Military-Industrial Complex Warning" >}}

*"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed."* - President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1961

**Opportunity cost note:** The {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} could fund other things: military R&D (GPS, internet came from this), tax cuts (~{{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} private returns), infrastructure, education, climate. But the dFDA's negative ICER ({{< var dfda_icer_per_qaly >}} per QALY) means it makes money while saving lives. Dominant interventions don't require opportunity cost tradeoffs - they're just better at everything.

{{< include ../figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-1-percent-treaty-column-chart.qmd >}}

### Mortality and Morbidity Burden

The World Health Organization reports {{< var global_daily_deaths_curable_diseases >}} {{< var global_daily_deaths_curable_diseases_cite >}} daily deaths from preventable or potentially curable diseases ({{< var global_annual_deaths_curable_diseases >}} [annually](../references.qmd#who-daily-deaths)).

![Annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](../../assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)

This mortality burden exceeds:

- [Annual terrorism deaths](../references.qmd#chance-of-dying-from-terrorism-1-in-30m) by a factor of {{< var disease_vs_terrorism_deaths_ratio >}}

$$
\frac{54.75\text{M disease deaths}}{3{,}000\text{ terrorism deaths}} \approx 18{,}274:1
$$

- [Annual war deaths](../references.qmd#acled-active-combat-deaths) by a factor of 137:1 (based on {{< var global_annual_conflict_deaths_total >}} conflict deaths annually)

$$
\frac{54.75\text{M disease deaths}}{400{,}000\text{ conflict deaths}} \approx 137:1
$$

Despite this disparity in mortality burden, resource allocation heavily favors security spending over medical research and curative interventions.

# How This Compares to History

### Better Than the Best Charities

The most effective charities on Earth ([GiveWell top charities](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)):

| Intervention | Cost Per Life Saved |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Against Malaria Foundation** | ~$3,000-$5,000 (heroic) |
| **1% Treaty + dFDA** | Society makes $1.1M profit per life |

#### The critical difference

GiveWell charities are the **best ways to spend money** saving lives. They're incredibly efficient.

This doesn't spend money. It **generates profit** while saving lives.

#### Translation

- Best charity: Costs $3,000-$5,000 per life saved (excellent)
- This system: Makes $1.1M profit per life saved (backwards economics)

One requires infinite fundraising from finite donors.
The other prints money while curing diseases.

Both are good. One breaks capitalism's usual rules.

{{< include ../figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

### Better Than History's Best Public Health Wins

| Intervention | How it Creates Value | Scale of Annual Net Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Childhood Vaccinations](../references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi)** | Prevents immense long-term treatment costs for diseases like measles and polio | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **Smoking Cessation** | Prevents expensive chronic diseases (cancer, heart disease) through low-cost interventions | Billions to Tens of Billions |
| **[Water & Sanitation](../references.qmd#clean-water-sanitation-roi)** | Avoids disease costs for entire populations at low cost | Hundreds of Millions to Billions |
| **[1% Treaty (Peace Dividend)](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd)** | Reduces global conflict costs by 1%, creating massive economic benefit | **~{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}, Annually** |
| **[dFDA (R&D Efficiency)](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)** | Makes clinical research ~{{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}}× more efficient, unlocking huge R&D savings | **~$50.0B, Annually** |

#### Why This Is Different

Vaccines and smoking cessation programs are amazing, they solve specific problems with a high return.

The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty and dFDA initiative tackles two problems at once:

1. **The Peace Dividend** is a massive economic gain on par with the largest public health wins, created simply by reducing a global negative (conflict)
2. **Patient-driven pragmatic trials** then use a tiny fraction of that gain to fix the *system* of medical research, generating a *second* massive win

Instead of solving one problem, this uses a global-scale win to fund a system-scale win. When you redirect the world's largest source of waste to fund its most impactful opportunity, the math gets wild.

### 10X Larger Than Childhood Vaccinations

{{< include ../figures/health-programs-vs-1-percent-treaty-societal-benefits-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The conservative case annual economic benefit of {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} significantly exceeds the most successful public health programs in history. Comparing to [childhood vaccination programs](../references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi) (estimated [10-20B annual global benefit](../references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi) from preventing measles, polio, etc.):

$$
\text{Relative Scale} = \frac{\$163.6\text{B}}{\sim\$15\text{B}} \approx 11:1
$$

where {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} is the [1% Treaty conservative case benefit](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) and {{< var childhood_vaccination_annual_benefit >}} {{< var childhood_vaccination_annual_benefit_cite >}} is the estimated [childhood vaccination annual benefit](../references.qmd#childhood-vaccination-roi).

This makes the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty/dFDA system **{{< var treaty_benefit_multiplier_vs_vaccines >}}X [larger in economic impact](../appendix/intervention-comparison-table.qmd)** than childhood vaccinations, one of the most successful public health interventions ever implemented.

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} in annual economic surplus (conservative case) to sustain operations and expansion without requiring ongoing charitable contributions.

### Comprehensive Comparison Across Intervention Types

The comparisons above focus on GiveWell charities and historical public health interventions because they represent **best-in-class efficiency** for direct health interventions. However, a complete cost-effectiveness analysis requires comparing the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty/dFDA system across multiple intervention categories:

#### Comparison to Research Investments

**NIH Intramural Research Program** (~$45B annually): Generates significant scientific advances but at substantially higher cost per discovery than the dFDA model. The NIH's traditional randomized controlled trial approach costs approximately {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var traditional_phase3_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient for Phase 3 trials, compared to dFDA's {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient (RECOVERY trial benchmark), representing a {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}}x efficiency gain. Both are valuable research investments, but they answer different questions: NIH prioritizes scientific rigor in controlled settings, while dFDA prioritizes real-world evidence at scale.

#### Comparison to Clinical Health Interventions

Comparing the dFDA's cost-effectiveness ({{< var dfda_icer_per_qaly >}} per QALY, representing net savings) to standard clinical interventions:

| Intervention Category | Cost per QALY | Typical Use Case |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **dFDA System** | **{{< var dfda_icer_per_qaly >}}** (net savings) | Systemic R&D efficiency improvement |
| **Medicare/Medicaid Coverage Expansion** | $50,000-100,000 | Expanding insurance coverage to uninsured populations |
| **Cancer Screening Programs** | $20,000-50,000 | Mammography, colonoscopy, prostate screening |
| **Cardiovascular Prevention** | $10,000-30,000 | Statins, blood pressure management, lifestyle interventions |
| **GiveWell Top Charities** | $3,000-5,000 | Malaria prevention, deworming, vitamin supplementation |

The negative cost per QALY ({{< var dfda_icer_per_qaly >}}) indicates this system **generates economic surplus while improving health**, placing it in a distinct category from interventions that cost money to deliver benefits. This is comparable to childhood vaccinations, which also generate net economic returns.

**Note on comparison methodology**: The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty/dFDA system operates at a systems level, simultaneously reallocating research funding, improving population health, generating economic returns, and reducing treatment costs. Comparing across intervention categories (charitable giving, public health, research investments, clinical care) involves different metrics and stakeholder perspectives. The comparisons presented focus on dimensions most relevant to decision-makers evaluating treaty adoption. The dFDA compares favorably to both research investments (efficiency per discovery) and direct health interventions (cost per QALY), though comprehensive comparison would require separate frameworks for each dimension.


# Who Benefits and How

The {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty creates positive economic incentives across all major groups, eliminating traditional opposition to healthcare system reform. This alignment makes it politically feasible and sustainable.

**Who Gets What** (see [Aligning Incentives](../solution/aligning-incentives.qmd) for details):

- **Defense sector**: Keeps {{< var defense_sector_retention_pct >}} of current budget 
- **Pharmaceutical industry**: Trial costs shift from expense to revenue (patients fund participation); [research capacity increases 115X](../appendix/research-acceleration-model.qmd)
- **Insurance companies**: Net savings from [reduced disease burden](../references.qmd#disease-economic-burden-109t) ({{< var global_disease_economic_burden_annual >}} current economic cost)
- **Healthcare providers**: More treatment options; [earlier access to effective therapies](../appendix/economic-value-of-accelerated-treatments.qmd)
- **Patients**: Access to clinical trials as healthcare and new treatments years or decades sooner
- **Taxpayers**: Net reduction in taxes and healthcare costs through improved R&D efficiency

The economic benefits outlined above demonstrate the value proposition of the {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} Treaty system. Implementation requires political mobilization to achieve treaty adoption:

**For comprehensive implementation details**, see:

- **[Campaign Budget](campaign-budget.qmd)** - Detailed breakdown of political mobilization costs
- **[VICTORY Social Impact Bonds](victory-bonds.qmd)** - Financing mechanism for lobbying efforts
- **[Financial Plan Overview](financial-plan.qmd)** - Complete fundraising, spending, and treasury management framework

### Campaign Budget Breakdown

The {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} [campaign cost](campaign-budget.qmd) (used as denominator in complete case {{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 ROI) allocates funds across three strategic categories:

| Budget Category | Amount | Purpose |
|:---|---:|:---|
| **[Global Referendum](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_referendum >}} | Global direct democracy campaign (280M votes), biometric verification, viral referral system, platform development. [Scenario analysis](campaign-budget.qmd#base-case-scenario): $140M-$406M depending on adoption curve |
| **[Political Lobbying](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}} | Legislative outreach (US/EU/G20), Super PACs, defense industry conversion, legal/compliance, opposition research. Outspends pharma + MIC combined |
| **[Reserve Fund](campaign-budget.qmd)** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_reserve >}} | Post-victory transition, treaty implementation support, contingency buffer |
| **Total Campaign Cost** | **{{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}}** | 4-year implementation timeline |

This budget is designed for a 3-5 year campaign to achieve treaty ratification by major powers, representing less than 4% of the first year's conservative benefits ({{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}}). The campaign cost is a one-time investment with perpetual returns, as the system becomes self-sustaining through the captured peace dividend.

This economic analysis focuses on the return on investment once the system is operational, demonstrating that the intervention generates {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 to {{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 returns regardless of the specific path to adoption.

# Why This Might Fail (And How to Make Sure It Doesn't)

Look, humans have an impressive track record of choosing the worst possible option when presented with obvious solutions. So let's address the ways you might screw this up.

## The "But Politicians Won't Do It" Problem

**What could go wrong**: Politicians refuse to redirect 1% of murder money to medicine money because defense contractors give them papers.

**Why this actually won't happen**:

Defense lobbyists currently get $1,813 back for every $1 spent corrupting democracy. You're offering VICTORY bondholders {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns. That's better. Defense contractors can do basic arithmetic (barely, but enough).

When you show them a spreadsheet where they keep 99% of their current contracts PLUS get {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns on bonds, they stop lobbying against you and start lobbying for you.

You're not defeating greed. You're redirecting it. Like convincing a river to flow downhill instead of uphill - technically you're not doing anything, you're just removing the dam.

Historical precedent: After WW2, humans cut military spending by {{< var post_ww2_military_cut_pct >}} {{< var post_ww2_military_cut_pct_cite >}} and accidentally created the greatest economic boom in history. You're asking for 1%. If cutting 30% worked, 1% should be manageable even for your species.

See [Treaty Adoption Strategy](../strategy/treaty-adoption-strategy.qmd) for the complete playbook on bribing democracy toward sanity.

## The "But What About Safety?" Problem

**What could go wrong**: Decentralized trials without 17-year approval processes will miss dangerous side effects and harm patients.

**Why this system is actually RADICALLY SAFER than the current FDA**:

### This System Detects MORE Safety Problems, Not Fewer

**Current FDA trials test on:**
- 100-300 patients per Phase 3 trial
- Patients carefully selected to be "perfect" sick (no comorbidities, no other medications, not too old, not too young)
- [85% of real patients excluded](../references.qmd#clinical-trial-exclusions)
- Short duration (3-12 months typically)
- Results: Miss rare side effects, miss long-term toxicity, miss drug interactions

**Pragmatic trial system tests on:**
- 10,000-100,000+ patients per trial (100× larger samples)
- Real patients with real comorbidities taking real combinations of medications
- Everyone included - old people, children, pregnant women (the people who actually need medicine)
- Continuous monitoring through EHR integration (years to decades, not months)
- Results: **Catches what the FDA misses**

#### Real Example: Benadryl and Dementia

The [Journal of the American Medical Association found](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2091745) that long-term Benadryl use increases dementia risk. This went **undetected for decades** under the current system because:
- Trials only monitored for months, not years
- No one tracked long-term outcomes after approval
- The harm was invisible until researchers manually aggregated health records

**Decentralized trials with continuous EHR monitoring would have caught this in 2-3 years instead of 40+ years.**

### Phase I Safety Testing Is PRESERVED

The decentralized system **keeps rigorous Phase I safety testing** (~{{< var phase_1_safety_duration_years >}} {{< var phase_1_safety_duration_years_cite >}} years). This is what prevented the [Thalidomide disaster](../references.qmd#thalidomide-no-us-birth-defects) in the US - existing 1938 FDA safety regulations worked perfectly. Zero American babies harmed while Europe had thousands of birth defects.

**What changes:** Eliminating the {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}} {{< var efficacy_lag_years_cite >}}-year efficacy delay AFTER safety is proven. You still can't sell poison. You just don't have to wait 8 years to prove aspirin helps headaches AFTER you've already proved it doesn't kill people.

### Publication Bias Eliminated = Safer

**Current system:**
- Companies [hide negative trial results](../references.qmd#publication-bias-clinical-trials) (only 37% published)
- Positive results: 94% published
- Cost: ~[$100 billion wasted annually](../references.qmd#wasted-spending-on-failed-experiments) repeating failed experiments
- Safety risk: Other researchers can't learn from failures, repeat dangerous experiments

**Decentralized system:**
- **All trials automatically published** when registered
- Cannot hide negative results (built into platform)
- Cannot selectively report outcomes
- Every researcher learns from every failure

### The Current System Is Demonstrably UNSAFE

[Rigorous analysis](../appendix/regulatory-mortality-analysis.qmd) shows:

- **{{< var regulatory_delay_deaths_mean >}}M preventable deaths** (1962-2024) from regulatory delay
- **{{< var type_ii_error_cost_ratio >}}:1 harm ratio**: For every 1 person the FDA saves by preventing unsafe drug approval, **{{< var type_ii_error_cost_ratio >}} people die** waiting for approval
- **Small trials on unrepresentative patients**: Test on 275 people, then prescribe to millions
- **No long-term data**: Most trials last 3-12 months; we have no idea what happens at year 5 or 10

$$
\frac{\text{Deaths from Delay}}{\text{Deaths from Unsafe Drugs Prevented}} = \frac{184.6M}{0.11M} = 1{,}610:1
$$

**The FDA doesn't make medicine safer. It creates a different kind of danger** - the invisible deaths of people who die waiting for approval, not the visible deaths that make headlines.

### Real-World Evidence Works

A [meta-analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200006223422506) compared high-quality observational studies to expensive randomized controlled trials across multiple interventions. **The results were statistically indistinguishable.**

![Comparison of effect sizes from observational studies versus randomized trials](../../assets/observational-vs-randomized-effect-sizes.png)

With modern statistical methods, large sample sizes, and continuous monitoring, we can detect both efficacy AND safety problems faster and more reliably than small, short trials on cherry-picked patients.

### This Isn't Theoretical - Oxford Proved It

The [RECOVERY trial](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd):
- Tested 6 treatments on **47,000 patients**
- Cost: {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient_cite >}} per patient
- Found dexamethasone (cut COVID deaths by 30%)
- **Ruled out hydroxychloroquine** (found it didn't work AND had safety concerns)
- Did this in **3 months**, not 3 years
- Saved over **1 million lives globally**

This was **safer** than traditional trials because:
- Larger sample size (47,000 vs. typical 300)
- Real-world patients (not cherry-picked)
- Faster results meant less time prescribing things blindly
- Published all results (including failures)

## The "But Patients Won't Participate" Problem

**What could go wrong**: Not enough patients volunteer for decentralized trials.

**Why this actually won't happen**:

Half of humanity says they'd volunteer for clinical trials if they could. Currently only {{< var current_clinical_trial_participation_rate >}} {{< var current_clinical_trial_participation_rate_cite >}} participate because:

- Trials require traveling 500 miles to university hospitals
- Trials exclude 85% of actual patients (too old, too young, too sick, wrong kind of sick)
- Trials pay nothing and cost weeks of your time

Decentralized pragmatic trials fix all of this:

- Join from your couch
- Everyone qualifies (you don't need to be the perfect kind of sick)
- Get subsidized to participate + access to treatments

Current barrier: "Drive 500 miles, wait 6 months, get rejected for having the disease wrong"
New barrier: "Click button"

You have 240 times more willing participants than current trials use. The bottleneck isn't human willingness. It's systemic stupidity.

## The "But We Might Run Out of Money" Problem

**What could go wrong**: Insufficient funding to run the campaign and build the system.

**Why this actually won't happen**:

The campaign needs {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} to convince [280M humans](../references.qmd#3-5-rule) ({{< var global_population_activism_threshold_pct >}} {{< var global_population_activism_threshold_pct_cite >}} of global population) to click "yes" on a website.

That's $3.57 per person. Less than a Starbucks latte. To end war and disease.

Once the treaty passes, it generates {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually. Every year. Forever. This is more money than 73% of countries have in their entire GDP.

The funding doesn't come from charity or begging donors. It comes from redirecting existing government spending that's already allocated. The money exists. You're just changing which column it goes into.

Traditional charity problem: Finite donors, infinite need
This system: Redirects existing government budgets from military to medical research, eliminating dependence on charitable fundraising

See [Investor Risk Analysis](../appendix/investor-risk-analysis.qmd) for the complete sensitivity analysis showing this works even when everything goes wrong.

## Who's Actually In Charge (Patients Edition)

The Decentralized Institutes of Health puts patients in control through trial participation, not committee votes.

**Current system**: [200 NIH bureaucrats](../references.qmd#nih-decision-makers-200-people) decide what 8 billion humans can try when dying

**New system**: Patients choose which trials to join. Trials that attract patients get funded. Trials that don't, die.

Your subsidy follows you to whichever trial you join. Researchers compete to design trials that patients actually want to participate in. No committees, no grant-writing contests, no bureaucrats deciding what's "worthy" of study.

All transactions publicly recorded. All spending transparent. All decisions auditable.

It's democracy for medicine - patients vote with their participation, not committees voting on what's "worthy" of study.

The system operates through distributed infrastructure:

- Open-source protocols (anyone can verify how it works)
- Distributed validation (no single point of failure)
- Works with existing regulators (additive layer, not replacement)

### Accountability measures

- Annual third-party audits of DIH treasury and dFDA operations
- Public reporting of all spending and outcomes
- Milestone-based funding (money releases when targets hit)

See [Governance and Accountability](../appendix/governance.qmd) and [Legal Structure](../appendix/legal-compliance-framework.qmd) for the complete system that prevents this from becoming another bureaucratic nightmare where nothing happens and everyone dies while committees meet.


# Limitations and Uncertainties

This analysis acknowledges several important limitations and sources of uncertainty inherent in modeling a transformative policy intervention of this scale.

## Model Assumptions and Constraints

### Adoption Timeline Uncertainty

The base case assumes gradual adoption over {{< var dfda_npv_adoption_ramp_years >}} years to full implementation. Actual adoption may be faster or slower depending on:

- **Regulatory harmonization:** International coordination requirements may extend implementation timelines
- **Technical infrastructure readiness:** EHR interoperability, data standardization, and privacy compliance vary significantly across jurisdictions
- **Industry cooperation:** Pharmaceutical companies, regulators, and healthcare providers will resist or accelerate adoption based on whether they profit from it

**Sensitivity analysis addresses this:** Worst-case scenario models extended timelines with ROI remaining positive (66:1) even under pessimistic assumptions.

### Cost Reduction Assumptions

The {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} baseline R&D cost reduction derives from the Oxford RECOVERY trial's demonstrated {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}} {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor_cite >}}× efficiency gain. However:

- **Trial complexity variation:** The RECOVERY trial focused on repurposed drugs for acute conditions; novel therapeutics for chronic diseases may not achieve equivalent cost reductions
- **Regulatory requirements:** Some trial phases (particularly safety studies) may retain higher costs regardless of decentralization
- **Geographic variation:** Cost reductions may be greater in high-cost jurisdictions (U.S., Europe) and lower in regions with already-efficient trial systems

**Conservative approach:** Analysis uses {{< var trial_cost_reduction_pct >}} reduction (midpoint) rather than the demonstrated 95%+ efficiency gains, providing substantial margin of safety.

### Generalizability from RECOVERY Trial and Historical Precedent

The analysis relies significantly on the Oxford RECOVERY trial as empirical evidence for cost reductions (82× efficiency gain). Potential concerns about generalizing from a single case study are addressed through historical context:

**Historical validation:** The physician-led pragmatic trial model has 80 years of empirical validation (1883-1960), not merely one modern case study. [144,000 physicians](../references.qmd#pre-1962-physician-trials) testing treatments on real patients in routine practice produced 4 years/decade life expectancy gains for 80 consecutive years before the 1962 regulatory shift.

**Trial complexity variation:** RECOVERY studied repurposed drugs (dexamethasone, hydroxychloroquine) for acute COVID-19 treatment. Novel therapeutics for chronic diseases may face different challenges. However:

- Conservative estimate uses 50-70% cost reduction (not the 95%+ demonstrated by RECOVERY)
- Pre-1962 system achieved similar efficiencies across diverse therapeutic areas (not limited to repurposed drugs)
- [Pragmatic trial literature](../references.qmd#pragmatic-trials-patsopoulos-2011) consistently shows 50-95% cost reductions across multiple contexts

**Conclusion:** While RECOVERY provides modern validation, the fundamental approach (decentralized physician-led efficacy testing) has extensive historical precedent suggesting generalizability beyond single case studies.

### Diminishing Returns in Research Productivity

Economic literature documents declining research productivity over time. [Bloom et al. (2020)](../references.qmd#bloom-ideas-getting-harder-2020) show research productivity falling ~5% annually across industries, with Moore's Law requiring 18× more researchers than in the 1970s to achieve constant improvement rates.

**Why this critique may not apply:**

This intervention targets a different margin than traditional research scaling. Bloom et al. measure **idea productivity** (breakthroughs per researcher-year). Our intervention targets **trial execution efficiency** (cost per patient enrolled, completion rates, recruitment speed).

#### Distinction

- **Bloom et al.:** Diminishing returns to *discovery* of new ideas (fundamental scientific breakthroughs getting harder to find)
- **dFDA model:** Improving *execution* of existing trial designs (removing administrative friction, not discovering new biology)

**Empirical evidence for efficiency gains:** RECOVERY trial and pre-1962 physician-led system both achieved 80-95% cost reductions by eliminating overhead (redundant monitoring, bespoke infrastructure, excessive documentation), not by making scientific discoveries easier.

**Sensitivity:** Even applying 50% diminishing returns adjustment to research acceleration estimates, ROI remains 230:1 (conservative) to 620:1 (complete). The intervention remains cost-effective under pessimistic productivity assumptions.

### Pragmatic Trial Internal Validity and Selection Bias

Decentralized trials with broad eligibility criteria face potential selection bias concerns. Traditional randomized controlled trials use restrictive eligibility *precisely* to control confounding and establish internal validity.

**Trade-off between internal and external validity:** [Patsopoulos (2011)](../references.qmd#pragmatic-trials-patsopoulos-2011) documents that pragmatic trials often find 15-25% smaller effect sizes than explanatory trials but offer superior external validity (generalizability to real-world populations). The [PRECIS tool (Thorpe et al. 2009)](../references.qmd#pragmatic-trials-precis-tool-2009) helps trial designers balance this trade-off across 10 domains.

#### Mitigation strategies

- **Randomization preserved:** dFDA maintains random treatment assignment (the core causal identification strategy)
- **Large sample sizes:** Decentralized recruitment enables 10-100× larger trials, improving statistical power and subgroup analysis
- **Covariate adjustment:** Electronic health record data enables controlling for confounders ex-post using propensity score matching and instrumental variables
- **Replication at scale:** Lower costs enable rapid replication across diverse populations, testing robustness

**Empirical evidence, observational studies produce valid results:** A [meta-analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM200006223422506) compared effect sizes from high-quality observational studies to randomized controlled trials across multiple interventions. The findings demonstrate that well-designed observational studies produce results statistically indistinguishable from expensive RCTs.

![Comparison of effect sizes from observational studies versus randomized trials for mortality outcomes, showing strong concordance between methodologies.](../../assets/observational-vs-randomized-effect-sizes.png)

![Comparison of effect sizes from observational studies versus randomized trials across diverse outcomes, demonstrating that observational methods yield similar conclusions when properly designed.](../../assets/observational-vs-randomized-trial-effect-sizes.png)

These meta-analytic findings support the validity of pragmatic trial designs used in the dFDA model. Modern statistical methods, large sample sizes, and proper covariate adjustment enable observational and quasi-experimental designs to achieve causal inference comparable to traditional RCTs at a fraction of the cost.

**Historical precedent:** Pre-1962 physician-led system successfully identified effective treatments (antibiotics, vaccines, surgical techniques) despite lacking modern randomization, suggesting real-world evidence can establish causality when combined with peer review and replication.

**Publication bias:** Traditional trials face severe publication bias: only [37% of negative results are published compared to 94% of positive results](../references.qmd#publication-bias-clinical-trials), leading to overestimation of treatment effectiveness and [~$100 billion annually wasted on repeating failed experiments](../references.qmd#wasted-spending-on-failed-experiments). The dFDA system addresses this by design: all trials are registered in the public database, all results (positive and negative) are automatically published through the transparent data infrastructure, and the open data architecture ensures no selective reporting. Unlike traditional systems where researchers choose what to publish, dFDA's mandatory publication of all registered trials eliminates publication bias as a concern.

**Conclusion:** Internal validity concerns are acknowledged, but the combination of randomization, large samples, and replication capacity provides adequate causal inference even with broader eligibility criteria.

### QALY Calculation Uncertainties

The {{< var global_dfda_qalys_gained_annual >}} annual QALY estimate aggregates three benefit streams with varying levels of empirical support:

**Stream A (Accelerated Drug Access):** High confidence, based on well-documented costs of delayed access (84,000 life-years lost per year delay in cancer therapies alone). However:

- Assumes pipeline drugs would eventually reach approval under current system
- Does not account for reduced efficacy if treatments reach patients in later disease stages

**Stream B (Prevention via Real-World Evidence):** Medium confidence, preventative care benefits are well-established, but scale of improvement from comprehensive data remains uncertain:

- Adherence improvements may be smaller than projected
- Selection bias in opt-in populations could limit generalizability

**Stream C (Rare Disease Treatments):** Lower confidence, economic viability of rare disease research is theoretically sound but empirically unproven at scale:

- Assumes cost reductions make trials economically viable
- Actual success rates for rare disease therapies remain uncertain

**Conservative approach:** Base case uses median estimates across all three streams; sensitivity analysis demonstrates positive returns even at conservative QALY levels ({{< var qalys_total_conservative >}} annually yields 66:1 ROI).

## Data Limitations

### Military Spending Data

Global military expenditure data ({{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}}, SIPRI 2024) is well-documented but:

- **Off-budget spending:** Some military expenditures may be classified or categorized elsewhere
- **Exchange rate fluctuations:** Multi-year projections require currency assumptions
- **Conflict zones:** Military spending in active conflict regions may be less fungible for redirection

### Clinical Trial Market Sizing

The {{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual >}} {{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual_cite >}} global clinical trials market estimate derives from industry reports, which:

- **Industry variation:** Methodologies vary across market research firms
- **Private vs. public trials:** Some trial spending may be unreported or proprietary
- **Non-pharmaceutical trials:** Medical device and digital health trials may have different cost structures

### QALY Valuation Thresholds

Standard willingness-to-pay thresholds (${{< var qalys_from_prevention_conservative >}}-{{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}} {{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd_cite >}} per QALY) vary by jurisdiction:

- **Geographic variation:** WHO recommends 1-3× GDP per capita; high-income countries use higher thresholds
- **Ethical considerations:** Monetary QALY valuations raise equity concerns
- **Discount rates:** Future health benefits discounted at {{< var npv_discount_rate_standard >}} may undervalue long-term gains

## Generalizability Constraints

### Political Feasibility

This analysis models economic returns conditional on treaty ratification. Political feasibility depends on:

- **Geopolitical stability:** International cooperation requirements may face challenges during periods of global tension
- **Domestic politics:** Military budget reductions face constituency resistance in defense-dependent regions
- **Lobbying influence:** Defense industry opposition may impede adoption

**Risk assessment:** The 1% reduction is intentionally modest to minimize political resistance. Historical precedents (military-to-civilian conversions post-Cold War) demonstrate feasibility.

### Institutional Capacity

Implementation requires substantial institutional development:

- **Regulatory expertise:** dFDA requires experienced personnel (FDA, EMA, other regulators)
- **Technical infrastructure:** Data systems, AI/ML capabilities, cybersecurity at global scale
- **Legal frameworks:** International treaties, data privacy compliance, intellectual property harmonization

**Mitigation:** Phased implementation allows capacity building concurrent with scale-up.

### Healthcare System Integration

Benefits assume integration with existing healthcare infrastructure:

- **EHR interoperability:** U.S. and other jurisdictions still face significant interoperability challenges
- **Wearable adoption:** Real-world data collection requires widespread wearable/digital health adoption
- **Provider participation:** Clinician buy-in necessary for trial recruitment and data quality

## Uncertainty Quantification

### Primary Risk Factors

The following table summarizes key risk factors and their mitigation strategies:

| Risk Factor | Level | Primary Uncertainty | Mitigation Strategy |
|:---|:---:|:---|:---|
| **Political Risk** | VERY HIGH | Treaty ratification dependent on international coordination | Modest 1% reduction; precedent from military-industrial lobbying ROI (1,813:1) |
| **Execution Risk** | HIGH | Complex global legal/technical coordination required | Phased implementation; leverage existing regulatory expertise |
| **Regulatory Risk** | MEDIUM-HIGH | Harmonization across jurisdictions varies | Pilot programs in willing jurisdictions first |
| **Market Risk** | VERY LOW | {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024_cite >}} military spending already allocated | Redirection rather than new appropriation |
| **Technical Risk** | MEDIUM | Data interoperability, AI/ML accuracy | Build on proven platforms (Medable $521M raised, $2.1B valuation) |

### Scenario Analysis Robustness

Comprehensive sensitivity analysis across multiple scenarios demonstrates:

- **Worst-case (66:1 ROI):** Benefits half as good, costs twice as high, intervention remains highly cost-effective
- **Conservative ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI):** R&D savings only, excludes peace dividend, intervention is dominant
- **Complete ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 ROI):** All quantifiable benefits, intervention transforms global health economics

**Key insight:** Even under pessimistic assumptions with multiple adverse conditions simultaneously occurring, the intervention generates positive returns exceeding most established public health programs.

## External Validity Considerations

### Transferability Across Contexts

This analysis models global implementation. Results may vary by:

- **Income level:** High-income countries may see greater cost reductions (trials more expensive); low-income countries may see greater health gains (larger disease burden)
- **Disease profiles:** Communicable disease contexts (prevalent in low-income settings) vs. chronic disease contexts (prevalent in high-income settings) may yield different QALY gains
- **Regulatory maturity:** Countries with established regulatory frameworks may implement faster

### Temporal Validity

Projections use 2024 baseline data. Secular trends may affect outcomes:

- **Medical technology advancement:** AI/ML capabilities improving rapidly; may enhance or diminish relative dFDA advantages
- **Geopolitical shifts:** Global military spending trends dependent on international relations
- **Healthcare costs:** Rising healthcare expenditures may increase baseline benefits; cost controls may decrease them

### General Equilibrium Effects

This analysis employs partial equilibrium methodology, holding prices and market structures constant while evaluating the intervention's direct effects. General equilibrium analysis would account for market adjustments to the $27.2B annual reallocation from military to medical research spending.

**Unmodeled general equilibrium effects include**:

1. **Defense sector employment displacement**: Reallocating 1% of military budgets affects 40,000-54,000 defense sector jobs (assuming $600k cost per job). Transition costs estimated at $2-4B annually for workforce retraining and economic adjustment. However, medical research sector job creation likely offsets much of this displacement.

2. **Data infrastructure scaling costs**: Decentralized trial infrastructure uses automated software (federated queries, not centralized databases), scaling through technology rather than labor. Unlike traditional research that faces researcher supply constraints, the system leverages existing EHR systems (Epic, Cerner) and adds coordination protocols. Marginal scaling costs are low relative to traditional models.

3. **Rent-seeking and administrative costs**: Historical analysis of large funding programs suggests 10-20% overhead from rent-seeking, lobbying, and administrative burden. Patient-driven trial participation (where subsidies follow patients to their chosen trials) reduces but does not eliminate these costs, as some administrative overhead is inevitable.

4. **Clinical trial market price effects**: Increasing trial demand by 115× could affect equilibrium prices for clinical research services. However, the pragmatic trial approach *reduces* per-trial costs (82× cheaper via automation), suggesting supply constraints may not bind. Traditional trials cost $41,000 per patient; decentralized trials target $500 per patient by eliminating overhead, not by increasing demand for scarce inputs.

5. **Crowding out effects**: Does $27.2B in new medical research displace existing research funding, or does it add incrementally? Conservative assumption: fully additive. If partially substitutive (e.g., governments reduce NIH funding in response), net research increase would be lower than modeled.

6. **Quality versus quantity trade-off**: 115× more trials may not yield proportional breakthroughs if resources spread thin or trial quality declines. The analysis assumes quality maintenance through peer review and replication; actual quality effects remain uncertain.

**Conservative treatment in base case**: The analysis excludes general equilibrium effects from benefit calculations, providing a lower bound estimate. Transition costs ($2-4B) are small relative to annual benefits ($163.6B conservative case), suggesting conclusions robust to general equilibrium adjustments.

**Methodological limitation acknowledged**: Full general equilibrium modeling (computable general equilibrium models with labor markets, international trade, and technology diffusion) would require substantial additional complexity beyond this analysis scope. The partial equilibrium approach follows standard cost-benefit analysis methodology for policy interventions.


## Failure Modes and Risk Scenarios

The economic analysis presented above assumes successful implementation of the dFDA system. This section explicitly examines failure modes that could prevent anticipated benefits from materializing, acknowledging that positive ROI estimates are conditional on effective execution.

### Implementation Failure Scenarios

#### False Positive Detection

**Risk**: Decentralized trials could produce false positive results, leading to approval of ineffective treatments.

**Mechanism**: Broader eligibility criteria and real-world settings introduce potential confounders. Without stringent monitoring, selection bias or inadequate randomization could yield spurious treatment effects.

**Consequence**: Approval of ineffective drugs wastes healthcare resources, erodes public trust, and potentially causes harm if ineffective treatments displace superior alternatives.

**Mitigation strategies in dFDA design**:

- Randomization preserved as core causal identification mechanism
- Large sample sizes (10-100× traditional trials) improve statistical power and enable sensitivity analysis
- Replication requirements across diverse populations test robustness
- Bayesian adaptive trial designs update probabilities continuously based on accumulating evidence
- Post-market surveillance using continuous real-world data collection detects efficacy deterioration

**Residual risk**: Even with mitigation, decentralized settings may have higher false positive rates than traditional controlled trials. This represents a fundamental trade-off between internal validity (causal certainty) and external validity (real-world generalizability).

#### The "But What About Safety?" Argument (Or: How The Current System Kills People By "Protecting" Them)

Critics will claim decentralized trials are less safe than traditional trials. This argument is backwards. Here's why.

**What The Current FDA System Actually Does For Safety**

The FDA tests new heart drugs on:

- 275 people
- Who don't have heart disease (excluded for comorbidities)
- Who aren't old (excluded - too risky)
- Who aren't on other medications (excluded - might confound results)
- Who aren't pregnant (excluded - all women of childbearing age)
- Who don't have kidney problems, liver problems, or literally any other health issues

Then they prescribe the drug to millions of people who have heart disease, are old, are on other medications, and have kidney problems.

**Result**: The drug works differently in actual patients than in trial patients. Adverse events appear in populations that were never tested.

Example: [Vioxx killed 60,000 people](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1447657/) after FDA approval because trials excluded the people most likely to die from it. The current system's "safety testing" missed the safety signal because they never tested it on anyone who would actually take it.

**What The dFDA Actually Does For Safety**

Phase I safety testing stays exactly the same. We're not idiots.

Phase I tests "Does this compound kill people immediately?" in controlled settings with intensive monitoring. This catches dangerous compounds before they reach patients. It worked for Thalidomide (zero American babies harmed because safety testing caught it). This continues.

What changes: Phase III efficacy trials become decentralized and efficient.

Phase III tests "Does this treatment work better than alternatives?" This doesn't require lab coats and clipboards. It requires asking "Did you get better or worse?"

**Why The dFDA Detects MORE Safety Problems, Not Fewer**

Current system safety surveillance:

- Tests on 15% of actual patient populations (excludes 85%)
- Trials last 6-18 months (misses long-term effects)
- Only 37% of negative results get published (companies hide failures)
- Small sample sizes (testing on 100-275 people, prescribing to millions)

dFDA safety surveillance:

- Tests on 100% of patient populations (everyone who volunteers)
- Continuous monitoring through EHR integration (detects long-term effects)
- All results automatically published (no hiding negative data)
- Massive sample sizes (240× more participants than current system)

The dFDA will detect adverse events that the current system misses:

1. **Subpopulation-specific harms**: Elderly patients, pregnant women, children, people with comorbidities - all the groups currently excluded from trials but given prescriptions anyway

2. **Drug interactions**: Real patients take multiple medications. Trial patients are excluded if they take anything else. The dFDA tests on people actually taking multiple drugs.

3. **Long-term toxicity**: Current trials monitor for months. The dFDA monitors continuously through EHR integration. Benadryl caused dementia for decades before anyone noticed because nobody tracked long-term outcomes. The dFDA would have caught this.

4. **Rare events**: Testing on 100 people catches common side effects. Testing on 100,000 people catches rare side effects. The dFDA does the latter.

##### The Publication Bias Safety Disaster

Current system safety flaw: Companies publish 94% of positive results but only 37% of negative results.

Translation: When a drug works, everyone hears about it. When a drug kills people, 63% of the time nobody finds out.

This means:

- Other companies waste billions testing the same failed (and dangerous) drugs
- Doctors prescribe drugs not knowing they failed previous trials
- Patients take medications that killed people in hidden trials

The dFDA solves this by making all results public automatically. Every trial registered. Every outcome recorded. Every adverse event published. No hiding failures. No repeating dangerous experiments.

###### The Actual Safety Comparison

| Safety Metric | Current FDA System | dFDA System |
|---|---|---|
| **Population tested** | 15% of patients (excludes 85%) | 100% of patients who volunteer |
| **Sample size** | 100-275 per drug | 10,000-100,000+ per drug |
| **Long-term monitoring** | 6-18 months, then stops | Continuous through EHR integration |
| **Subpopulation testing** | Excludes elderly, children, pregnant, comorbid | Includes all populations |
| **Negative result publication** | 37% published, 63% hidden | 100% published automatically |
| **Drug interaction testing** | Excluded (patients can't be on other meds) | Included (real patients take multiple drugs) |
| **Rare event detection** | Requires > 1% frequency to detect | Detects events as rare as 0.01% |

The current system is "safe" the way TSA is "safe" - it provides the appearance of safety through intensive theater while missing actual threats.

The dFDA is safe the way seatbelts and airbags are safe - it actually measures what happens to real people in real conditions and adjusts accordingly.

###### What About Truly Novel Drugs?

For novel mechanism-of-action drugs (new compounds never tested in humans), Phase I and early Phase II safety testing remains in controlled settings with intensive monitoring.

The dFDA doesn't decentralize initial safety testing. It decentralizes efficacy testing and post-market surveillance.

Current system: Test safety on 50 people in lab, test efficacy on 275 people in controlled trial, prescribe to millions, hope nothing goes wrong

dFDA system: Test safety on 50 people in lab (same as current), test efficacy on 50,000 people in real-world conditions, detect problems before prescribing to millions

The dFDA adds layers of safety monitoring. It doesn't remove them.

**Who Benefits From The "dFDA Is Unsafe" Argument**

Pharmaceutical companies benefit from high trial costs because it prevents competition. If trials cost $2.6 billion, only massive corporations can afford to develop drugs. High costs = high barriers to entry = monopoly profits.

FDA bureaucrats benefit from slow approvals because they face no consequences for delays but get pilloried if they approve something that causes newsworthy harms. Delay = safety from blame.

Neither group benefits from the dFDA making trials cheaper, faster, and more accessible. So they'll claim it's "unsafe" while defending a system that:

- Killed 60,000 people with Vioxx
- Delayed beta-blockers for a decade, killing 100,000+ Americans
- Excludes 85% of patients from trials then prescribes them the drugs anyway
- Hides 63% of negative trial results
- Tests drugs on 275 people then gives them to millions

The current system isn't safe. It's just expensive and slow enough that nobody can prove it killed you specifically.

The dFDA will generate more safety data, from more diverse populations, with better long-term monitoring, than any system in human history.

Safety isn't the risk. The risk is that the current system's beneficiaries will claim the dFDA is unsafe to protect their monopolies.

#### Regulatory Rejection

**Risk**: Regulatory agencies (FDA, EMA) refuse to accept dFDA trial evidence for approval decisions.

**Mechanism**: Regulators may view decentralized trial data as insufficiently rigorous, cite concerns about data quality, or face political pressure from pharmaceutical companies and CROs invested in traditional trial infrastructure.

**Consequence**: Even if dFDA trials generate valid efficacy evidence, failure to achieve regulatory acceptance prevents market access. The entire cost-reduction thesis collapses if dFDA trials must be repeated using traditional methods for approval.

**Empirical precedent**: FDA's accelerated approval pathway and RECOVERY trial's global emergency use authorization demonstrate regulatory willingness to accept alternative evidence standards when public health benefits are clear.

**Mitigation strategies**:

- Pilot programs establish proof-of-concept in willing jurisdictions (e.g., UK MHRA, which already accepted RECOVERY evidence)
- Regulatory harmonization efforts (ICH guidelines) create international standards for pragmatic trial designs
- Phased implementation allows regulators to observe real-world performance before full commitment
- Hybrid trial designs combine pragmatic Phase III efficacy testing with traditional Phase II safety validation

**Residual risk**: Regulatory capture by pharmaceutical industry incumbents could block adoption. See [Investor Risk Analysis](../appendix/investor-risk-analysis.qmd) for political economy analysis of implementation barriers.

#### Pharmaceutical Industry Adoption Failure

**Risk**: Pharmaceutical companies decline to use dFDA platform, preferring traditional controlled trials despite higher costs.

**Mechanism**: Industry may resist for several reasons:

- **Control preference**: Traditional trials offer greater control over patient selection, endpoints, and data interpretation
- **Intellectual property concerns**: Sharing data with decentralized platforms may expose competitive information
- **Risk aversion**: Established trial methods are predictable; dFDA represents uncertain innovation
- **Regulatory conservatism**: Companies may prefer proven pathways over novel approaches requiring regulatory negotiation

**Consequence**: If pharmaceutical industry participation is low, dFDA trial volume remains small, preventing economies of scale and limiting cost reductions. The intervention fails to transform drug development economics.

**Mitigation strategies**:

- Economic incentives: 82× cost reduction creates overwhelming financial motivation for adoption
- First-mover advantages: Companies adopting early gain competitive speed-to-market advantages
- Regulatory push: If regulators preferentially review dFDA submissions (shorter timelines), companies face competitive pressure to adopt
- Public funding focus: Government-funded research (NIH, Wellcome Trust) can mandate dFDA platform use, creating initial scale

**Empirical precedent**: Electronic data capture systems and clinical trial registries faced similar industry resistance but achieved near-universal adoption once cost benefits became clear or regulatory requirements were established.

**Residual risk**: Oligopolistic pharmaceutical market structure enables coordinated resistance. Large incumbents may lobby against dFDA adoption to protect barriers to entry against smaller competitors.

### Conditional Benefits Interpretation

The ROI estimates ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 conservative, {{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 complete) are **conditional on successful implementation**—they represent returns *if* the dFDA operates as designed. Expected value analysis (see "Expected Value Analysis Accounting for Political Risk" section) incorporates probability-weighted scenarios. This section examines operational and technical failure modes that could occur even after political success, complementing the [Investor Risk Analysis](../appendix/investor-risk-analysis.qmd) focus on political barriers. Pilot implementations should monitor false positive rates, adverse event detection sensitivity, regulatory acceptance rates, and industry adoption velocity to enable early course corrections.

## Limitations Summary

Despite these limitations, several factors support the analysis's robustness:

1. **Conservative assumptions throughout:** Base case uses median estimates; optimistic scenarios excluded from primary ROI ({{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1)
2. **Empirical grounding:** Cost reductions based on demonstrated RECOVERY trial results, not theoretical models
3. **Sensitivity analysis:** Wide range of scenarios tested; positive returns maintained across all plausible parameter combinations
4. **Dominant intervention status:** Negative ICER ({{< var dfda_icer_per_qaly >}}/QALY) means intervention saves money even if health benefits are substantially overstated

**Transparency commitment:** All parameters, data sources, and calculation methodologies are publicly documented with confidence levels and last-update dates in [Parameters and Calculations Reference](../appendix/parameters-and-calculations.qmd) and [References](../references.qmd).

Future research priorities include prospective data collection during pilot implementations, real-world validation of cost reduction estimates, and longitudinal assessment of QALY gains across diverse populations and disease contexts.


# Conclusion

Redirecting {{< var treaty_reduction_pct >}} of global military spending to medical research generates {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 to {{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 ROI, depending on what you count.

**The Numbers**:

- **Zero new spending**: Money redirected from existing military budgets
- **Dominant intervention**: Saves money while saving lives (rare in health economics)
- **Conservative case**: {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 ROI counting only R&D efficiency

$$
\frac{\$249.0\text{B benefit}}{\$538\text{M cost}} = 463:1
$$

([full analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd))

- **Complete case**: {{< var dfda_roi_rd_plus_delay >}}:1 ROI including all eight benefit streams ({{< var treaty_total_complete_benefits_annual >}} annually)
- **Lives saved**: {{< var treaty_total_lives_saved_annual >}}/year while generating [$6.56M profit per life](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd)
- **Political feasibility**: Everyone profits (nobody needs to be convinced, just paid)

**Comparison**: Exceeds smallpox eradication and childhood vaccinations - history's previous best public health achievements - while requiring zero charitable donations. ([Detailed comparisons](../appendix/intervention-comparison-table.qmd))

**Timeline**: [36 months](../strategy/roadmap.qmd) from global referendum to full deployment. ([Complete roadmap](../strategy/roadmap.qmd))

**The Evidence**: Conservative assumptions, validated by [Oxford RECOVERY trial](../appendix/recovery-trial.qmd), tested via [sensitivity analysis](../appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd). Uses standard health economics (NPV, QALYs, ICER) for direct comparison with existing interventions.

**The Reality**: This works because every step is economically rational for everyone involved. Nobody needs to evolve morally. They just need to count.
