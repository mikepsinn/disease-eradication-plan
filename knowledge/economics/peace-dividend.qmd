```

Here's what 1% less murder money buys:

- **DIH gets**: [`{python} treaty_annual_funding_formatted`](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) to subsidize hyper-efficient pragmatic clinical trials
- **World saves**: [`{python} peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit_formatted`](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) not spent rebuilding bombed hospitals, treating shrapnel wounds, and housing refugees
- **Source**: [Cost of War breakdown](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd)

## How 1% Less Violence Pays For Everything

The [dFDA analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) proves medical research can work 82x better. This explains where you steal the money to fund it.

Two ways you profit from building 1% fewer bombs:

### 1. The Captured Money: $27.2B/Year

Governments spend {{< var global_military_spending_post_treaty_annual_2024 >}} yearly on things designed to make other things stop existing.

Redirect 1%:

${{< var global_military_spending_post_treaty_annual_2024 >}} \times 0.01 = \$27.2B$$

This $27.2B funds the dFDA, VICTORY bonds, and the whole system.

### 2. The Bonus Savings: $113.6B/Year

That's what you capture. Here's what you save.

Wars cost [$11.4T/year](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd). Build 1% fewer bombs, fight 1% fewer wars, save $113.6B.

$$11.4T \times 0.01 = \$113.6B$$

Money no longer spent on:

- Unblowing-up hospitals and bridges
- Treating humans full of shrapnel
- Housing refugees (people whose homes got exploded)
- Trade disruptions (hard to ship stuff through war zones)

Here's the breakdown:

### Where the $113.6B Comes From

Based on [Cost of War analysis](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd):

| What Wars Cost | Total/Year | 1% Less War Saves |
|:---|---:|---:|
| **Direct Costs** | **{{< var global_annual_war_direct_costs_total >}}** | **$77B** |
| Military budgets | {{< var global_military_spending_post_treaty_annual_2024 >}} | {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} |
| Destroying infrastructure | {{< var global_annual_infrastructure_destruction_conflict >}} | $19B |
| Human casualties | {{< var global_annual_human_life_losses_conflict >}} | {{< var dih_treasury_to_medical_research_annual >}} |
| Trade disruption | {{< var global_annual_trade_disruption_conflict >}} | $6.2B |
| **Indirect Costs** | **{{< var global_annual_war_indirect_costs_total >}}** | **$37B** |
| Lost economic growth | {{< var global_military_spending_post_treaty_annual_2024 >}} | {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} |
| Veteran healthcare | {{< var sensitivity_peace_dividend_optimistic >}} | $2.0B |
| Refugee support | {{< var global_annual_refugee_support_costs >}} | $1.5B |
| Environmental damage | {{< var global_clinical_trial_market_annual >}} | $1.0B |
| PTSD and mental health | {{< var global_annual_psychological_impact_costs_conflict >}} | $2.3B |
| Lost human capital | {{< var global_annual_lost_human_capital_conflict >}} | $3.0B |
| **Total** | **$11.4T** | **$113.6B** |

You capture $27.2B for medicine.

You save $113.6B on not breaking stuff.

That's $5.18 saved for every $1 redirected.

Plus cancer gets cured as a bonus.
