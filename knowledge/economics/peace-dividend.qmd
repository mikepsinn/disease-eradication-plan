Here's what 1% less murder money buys:

- **DIH gets**: [`{python} treaty_annual_funding_formatted`](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) to subsidize hyper-efficient pragmatic clinical trials
- **World saves**: [`{python} peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit_formatted`](../appendix/peace-dividend-calculations.qmd) not spent rebuilding bombed hospitals, treating shrapnel wounds, and housing refugees
- **Source**: [Cost of War breakdown](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd)

## How 1% Less Violence Pays For Everything

The [dFDA analysis](../appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) proves medical research can work {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}× better. This explains where you steal the money to fund it.

Two ways you profit from building 1% fewer bombs:

### 1. The Captured Money: {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}/Year

Governments spend {{< var global_military_spending_post_treaty_annual_2024 >}} yearly on things designed to make other things stop existing.

Redirect 1%:

$${{< var global_military_spending_post_treaty_annual_2024 >}} \times 0.01 = \$27.2B$$

This \{{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} funds the dFDA, VICTORY bonds, and the whole system.

### 2. The Bonus Savings: \{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/Year

That's what you capture. Here's what you save.

Wars cost [\$11.4T/year](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd). Build 1% fewer bombs, fight 1% fewer wars, save \${{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}.

$$11.4T \times 0.01 = \$113.6B$$

Money no longer spent on:

- Unblowing-up hospitals and bridges
- Treating humans full of shrapnel
- Housing refugees (people whose homes got exploded)
- Trade disruptions (hard to ship stuff through war zones)

Here's the breakdown:

### Where the \{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} Comes From

Based on [Cost of War analysis](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd):

| What Wars Cost | Total/Year | 1% Less War Saves |
|:---|---:|---:|
| **Direct Costs** | **{{< var global_annual_war_direct_costs_total >}}** | **{{< var peace_dividend_direct_costs >}}** |
| Military budgets | {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}} | {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} |
| Destroying infrastructure | {{< var global_annual_infrastructure_destruction_conflict >}} | {{< var peace_dividend_infrastructure >}} |
| Human casualties | {{< var global_annual_human_life_losses_conflict >}} | {{< var peace_dividend_human_casualties >}} |
| Trade disruption | {{< var global_annual_trade_disruption_conflict >}} | {{< var peace_dividend_trade_disruption >}} |
| **Indirect Costs** | **{{< var global_annual_war_indirect_costs_total >}}** | **{{< var peace_dividend_indirect_costs >}}** |
| Lost economic growth | {{< var global_annual_lost_economic_growth_military_spending >}} | {{< var peace_dividend_lost_economic_growth >}} |
| Veteran healthcare | {{< var global_annual_veteran_healthcare_costs >}} | {{< var peace_dividend_veteran_healthcare >}} |
| Refugee support | {{< var global_annual_refugee_support_costs >}} | {{< var peace_dividend_refugee_support >}} |
| Environmental damage | {{< var global_annual_environmental_damage_conflict >}} | {{< var peace_dividend_environmental >}} |
| PTSD and mental health | {{< var global_annual_psychological_impact_costs_conflict >}} | {{< var peace_dividend_ptsd >}} |
| Lost human capital | {{< var global_annual_lost_human_capital_conflict >}} | {{< var peace_dividend_lost_human_capital >}} |
| **Total** | **{{< var global_annual_war_total_cost >}}** | **{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}** |

You capture {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} for medicine.

You save {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} on not breaking stuff.

That's $5.18 saved for every $1 redirected.

Plus cancer gets cured as a bonus.
