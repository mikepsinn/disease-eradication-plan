## How to Buy a Planet for {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}}

Traditional campaigns throw papers at problems until the papers or the problems disappear. Usually the papers disappear first.

You're using AI and game theory to do for {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} what normally costs $2-5B. It's like buying everything at Costco but for democracy corruption.

**Funding structure**: 100% VICTORY Social Impact Bonds (~$1B). Donations are optional/bonus. See [Fundraising Strategy: Capital Structure](../appendix/fundraising-strategy.qmd#capital-structure-campaign-vs-implementation) for detailed breakdown.

This {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} will:

- Reach 8 billion humans by paying them $0.20 for each referred verified vote (cheaper than advertising, more effective than begging)
- Out-bribe defense lobbyists (they work for whoever pays more)
- Build platforms with AI doing 90% of the work (humans just point and say "not that")
- Make the treaty inevitable in pilot countries, then watch it spread like a virus but helpful

**The Strategy**: Make supporting the treaty more profitable than opposing it. Then sit back and watch greed do the right thing by accident.

## Why {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} Instead of $5B {#ai-assisted-lobbying-250m-25}

**Old Way** (throwing papers at humans):

- Lawyers: $100-200M (they charge by the word)
- Software: $250-400M (built by people who've never used software)
- TV ads: {{< var campaign_media_budget_min >}}-{{< var campaign_media_budget_max >}} (screaming at people during football)
- Lobbyists: $400-600M (professional democracy corrupters)
- **Total: $1.25-2.2B** (enough to cure several diseases, ironically)

**Your Way** (AI + Incentives):

- AI lawyers + human review: {{< var campaign_legal_ai_budget >}} (robots draft, humans fix the stupid parts)
- AI-coded platforms: {{< var campaign_platform_development >}} (GitHub but with more begging)
- Viral bribes: {{< var campaign_viral_content_budget >}} (humans recruit humans for pocket change)
- Strategic lobbying: {{< var campaign_lobbying_us >}} (bribe only the humans who matter)
- **Total: {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}}** (80% savings, same corruption)

### The Minimum Viable Budget

The $1B target is overkill-by-design. The actual cost to get governments to sign a piece of paper? Historically, ~$90–140 million.

The Ottawa Treaty (banning landmines) cost $15M in diplomatic paperwork. The Nuclear Ban Treaty: $10M. Countries love signing papers - it makes them look good without doing anything.

See [Treaty Feasibility & Cost Analysis](../appendix/treaty-feasibility.qmd) for the full breakdown of why getting signatures is cheap and implementation is where the real money goes.

## Where the Papers Go

### 1. Viral Referendum (part of {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_referendum >}} Referendum Budget)

#### Paying Humans to Click

The strategy: Generate referral links, pay people $0.25-0.30 per verified vote, let greed do the marketing.

**What $0.50/vote actually buys** (blended cost):

- Referral payment: ~$0.25 per verified vote (the actual reward people get)
- Biometric verification: ~$0.18 per attempt (ComplyCube, Ondato, Veriff at scale)
- Verification friction: 15-20% don't complete (need 330M attempts for 280M verified)
- Platform overhead: ~$0.07 per vote (development, hosting, fraud prevention)

Comparable: Traditional petition signatures cost $14.87 each in 2024 (Ballotpedia). You're 96% cheaper.

**Target: 280M verified votes** (3.5% of global population = tipping point for social change)

#### Payment structure

- Standard reward: $0.25-0.30 per verified vote via referral link
- Early adopter bonus: $0.50 for first 10M (creates FOMO)
- Recruitment bonus: $0.10 per successful recruit (pyramid scheme but legal)

**The Clicking Platform**: {{< var campaign_platform_development >}}


- Biometric verification (one vote per meat body)
- 50+ languages (AI translates, humans check for accidental declarations of war)
- Mobile-first (humans glued to phones anyway)

**Viral Content** (optional acceleration): {{< var campaign_viral_content_budget >}}

When you're paying people real money ($0.25-0.30) for verified referrals, they become your marketing team. This budget is for:

- AI generates memes about death (surprisingly good at this)
- A/B testing until humans can't resist voting
- Local versions (different cultures, same mortality)
- Micro-influencers (people trust strangers with 10K followers more than experts)

Alternative: Skip this, increase referral payment to $0.35-0.40, let economics drive virality. PayPal and Dropbox proved you don't need marketing when you're paying real money.

**Community Organizing** (optional acceleration): {{< var campaign_community_organizing >}}

Organic communities form when there's money involved. This budget is for:

- 100+ country ambassadors (humans who like organizing other humans)
- Tools for coordination (spreadsheets that don't crash)
- Event support (folding chairs and PowerPoints)

Alternative: Skip this, use the $30M to increase verification budget or referral rewards.

#### Budget Scenarios: Accounting for Increasing Marginal Costs

**The Problem**: Not all voters cost the same.

Early adopters (believers, idealists, people who care about curing disease) will vote for minimal incentive. They're excited about the mission. Maybe they vote for free, maybe $0.25 is plenty.

But to hit 280M votes (3.5% of global population), you need more than believers. You need skeptics. You need people who don't care about politics. You need people actively resistant to change.

**Diffusion of innovations theory** (Rogers, 2003):

- 2.5% innovators (vote for free, do it for the mission)
- 13.5% early adopters ($0.25/vote, minimal incentive needed)
- 34% early majority ($0.50/vote, need moderate incentive)
- 34% late majority ($0.75-1.00/vote, skeptical, need convincing)
- 16% laggards ($1.50-2.00/vote, actively resistant)

**PayPal case study**: Started at $20/referral (1999), optimized to $10-20 range. Inflation-adjusted: ~$18-36 in 2024 dollars. But PayPal was recruiting early adopters (tech-savvy users in Silicon Valley). Not laggards.

#### Three Budget Scenarios for 280M Votes

<a id="base-case-scenario"></a>

**Scenario A: Base Case** ({{< var treaty_campaign_viral_referendum_base_case >}})

Assumes flat $0.50/vote, no increasing marginal costs.

Components:

- Platform Development: $35M
- Viral Content: $40M (optional)
- Community Organizing: $30M (optional)
- Verification + Payments: $35M

**Risk**: Optimistic. Assumes you can acquire last 80M votes (late majority + laggards) at same cost as first 10M (believers). Unlikely.

**When this works**: If virality is so strong that social proof does the heavy lifting. If voting becomes trendy. If celebrities make it cool. If FOMO is real.

<a id="realistic-scenario"></a>

**Scenario B: Realistic** ({{< var treaty_campaign_viral_referendum_realistic >}})

Assumes moderate increasing marginal costs.

Components:

- Platform Development: $35M
- Seed Marketing: $5M (skip viral content budget, let referral economics drive virality)
- Verification (330M attempts × $0.18): $59M
- Tiered Referral Payments: $126M
  - First 10M (innovators + early adopters): $0.25/vote = $2.5M
  - Next 90M (early majority): $0.50/vote = $45M
  - Next 100M (late majority): $0.75/vote = $75M
  - Final 80M (laggards): $1.00/vote = $80M

**Total: $225M** (rounding: {{< var treaty_campaign_viral_referendum_realistic >}})

**Rationale**: Follows diffusion curve but assumes strong virality reduces laggard cost from $2.00 to $1.00. Still 23x cheaper than petition signatures ($14.87 each).

<a id="worst-case-scenario"></a>

**Scenario C: Worst Case** ({{< var treaty_campaign_viral_referendum_worst_case >}})

Assumes high increasing marginal costs, poor virality.

Components:

- Platform Development: $35M
- Seed Marketing: $5M
- Verification (350M attempts × $0.18): $63M
- Tiered Referral Payments: $312M
  - First 10M: $0.25/vote = $2.5M
  - Next 90M: $0.50/vote = $45M
  - Next 100M: $1.00/vote = $100M
  - Final 80M: $2.00/vote = $160M

**Total: $415M** (parameter: {{< var treaty_campaign_viral_referendum_worst_case >}})

**When you need this**: If virality is weak. If people are skeptical. If competing campaigns poison the well. If verification UX is poor (only 70% conversion instead of 85%).

#### Still cheaper than alternatives

- Traditional petition gathering: 280M × $14.87 = $4.2 BILLION
- Digital advertising (CPA $5-15): 280M × $10 avg = $2.8 BILLION
- Worst-case treaty campaign: $406M

**You're still 90% cheaper in the WORST case.**

#### Recommended Approach

**Raise for worst-case** ($400M+), **execute with realistic assumptions** ($220M), **celebrate if base case works** ($140M).

Unused funds roll into:

- Higher referral payments (accelerate growth)
- Post-victory treaty implementation
- Development of your decentralized framework for drug assessment (dFDA)
- Reserve for Year 2-3 scaling

**Budget allocation transparency**: Live dashboard at WarOnDisease.org/budget shows real-time:

- Which scenario is playing out (are we at base case, realistic, or worst case costs?)
- Current cost per verified vote by cohort
- Conversion rate optimization (is verification UX working?)
- Funds remaining vs. target (are we on track?)

### 2. Professional Bribery (part of {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}} Lobbying Budget)

**Lobbying (AI-Targeted)**: $150M

Here's how professional democracy corruption works:

- AI identifies which humans can be bribed to change laws
- You bribe those specific humans (not all humans, just the useful ones)
- Focus: US ({{< var campaign_lobbying_us >}}), EU ({{< var campaign_lobbying_eu >}}), G20 ({{< var campaign_lobbying_g20_millions >}})
- AI writes the laws, lawyers make them legal-sounding

**Buying Defense Lobbyists**: {{< var campaign_defense_lobbyist_budget >}}

Defense lobbyists currently work for whoever pays them. So you pay them more:

- Top 50 lobbyists get bond offers (become rich by lobbying FOR life instead of death)
- Defense execs get early bond access ({{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} beats their stock options)
- Pension funds get fiduciary obligation (required to take best returns, oops)
- "Consulting fees" to Pentagon retirees (it's not bribery if you call it consulting)

**Super PAC Papers**: {{< var campaign_super_pac_budget >}}

- AI finds swing districts (where papers matter most)
- Targeted ads (you see "cure cancer," your neighbor sees "lower taxes")
- Voter education (facts presented as if they matter)

**Opposition Research**: {{< var campaign_opposition_research >}}

- AI monitors what opponents say (robots never sleep)
- Instant fact-checking (faster than humans can lie)
- Protect treaty supporters (politics is mean, apparently)

### 3. Technology (part of {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_referendum >}} Referendum Budget)

**Decentralized framework for drug assessment (dFDA)**: $120M

The core platform for a global framework of pragmatic clinical trials:

- AI writes 60% of code (humans fix the bugs AI introduces while fixing bugs)
- Pragmatic clinical trial matching (sick people find treatments, treatments find sick people)
- Real-world effectiveness tracking (what actually works vs what companies claim works)
- Integration with existing health systems (designed by different companies who hate each other)

**Wishocracy Platform**: $70M

Direct democracy except it works:

- Voting system (humans click things, system counts accurately)
- Identity verification (one human = one vote, revolutionary concept)
- Works in 50+ languages (math is universal, opinions are local)
- Built on open source (free code from people smarter than you)

**Cloud Infrastructure for the Framework**: {{< var campaign_infrastructure >}}

Computers that store everything:

- 5-year hosting for 8 billion humans (costs less than one bomber)
- Global CDN (fast loading even in places with bad internet)
- Security (keeping out humans who like breaking things)
- Backups of backups (paranoia as a service)

**Pilot Programs**: {{< var campaign_pilot_programs >}}

- Test in 2 small countries first (if it breaks, fewer people notice)
- 100K beta users (find problems before 8 billion users do)
- Security audits (pay hackers to break it before bad hackers do)

### 4. Lawyers (AI-Assisted) (part of {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}} Lobbying Budget)

**Legal Work**: {{< var campaign_legal_work >}}

- AI drafts everything (500 pages in 5 minutes)
- Lawyers review (fix the parts that would cause prison)
- International treaty law (experts in papers that countries sign then ignore)
- Multi-country compliance (each country has different rules for the same bribery)

**Regulatory Navigation**: {{< var campaign_regulatory_navigation >}}

- Campaign finance compliance in 50+ countries (bribery is legal if you file the right forms)
- AI monitors rule changes (governments change rules constantly)
- Risk management (avoid prison)

**Legal Defense**: {{< var campaign_legal_defense >}}

- Fund for when they sue you anyway (they will)
- Insurance (in case fund isn't enough)
- Whistleblower protection (pay people to report your own violations before others do)

### 5. Co-opting the Opposition (part of {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}} Lobbying Budget)

**Defense Industry Conversion**: {{< var campaign_defense_conversion >}}

Turn enemies into allies through superior returns:

- VICTORY Bonds for key players ({{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} beats their current profits)
- Pension fund outreach (fiduciary duty requires taking best returns)
- Board members as "advisors" (pay them to shut up)

**Healthcare Industry Alignment**: {{< var campaign_healthcare_alignment >}}

- Insurance companies (healthy people = fewer claims = more profit)
- Hospitals (integrated trials = patients pay them instead)
- Pharma (trials become profit centers, not cost centers)
- Medical devices (new markets for gadgets)

**Tech Partnerships**: {{< var campaign_tech_partnerships >}}

- AI/ML infrastructure (they have servers, you need servers)
- Cloud credits (free computers from companies with too many computers)
- Open source (programmers work for free if you ask nicely)

**Celebrity Endorsements**: {{< var campaign_celebrity_endorsement >}}

- Famous people saying things (humans listen to famous people)
- Scientists with credentials (humans trust credentials)
- Cultural influencers (humans who influence culture, apparently)

### 6. Operations (overhead across all categories)

**Core Team**: {{< var campaign_staff_budget >}}

- 20-30 leaders (AI-augmented means fewer humans needed)
- 50 regional directors (not 500, AI handles coordination)
- Remote-first (no expensive offices, just Zoom)

**Infrastructure**: {{< var campaign_infrastructure >}}

- Virtual offices (Slack channels cost less than buildings)
- AI assistants (robots that schedule meetings)
- Minimal travel (video calls work, flying is wasteful)

**Contingency**: {{< var campaign_contingency >}}

Papers for when plans fail (plans always fail somewhere)

### 7. Post-Victory Transition: {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_reserve >}}

**Treaty Implementation**: {{< var campaign_treaty_implementation >}}

- Help countries implement what they signed (signing is easy, implementing is hard)
- Dispute resolution (countries argue, you mediate)
- Coordination (herding cats but the cats are nations)

**Scaling Preparation**: {{< var campaign_scaling_prep >}}

- Setup for a 1% Treaty Fund (where redirected military spending will be held and allocated)
- Scaling blueprints for your decentralized framework for drug assessment (dFDA), with instructions for going from 100K to 8B users
- Governance launch (democratic system that actually works)

## Timeline

**Year 1** ({{< var campaign_phase1_budget >}}): Proof it works

- 50M humans vote yes
- 2 countries sign
- Platform doesn't crash

**Years 2-3** ({{< var campaign_phase2_budget >}}): Scale

- 280M total votes
- 20+ countries negotiating treaties
- Platform handles global traffic

**Years 4-5** ($300M): Victory

- 100+ countries signed
- Major powers committed
- A network of decentralized institutes of health (DIH) is operational
- Death becomes optional

## Why This Works

**Math**:

- AI + viral mechanics = 80% cost reduction
- $0.20/vote vs $5-15 traditional advertising
- 500 humans + AI = 5,000-person traditional campaign
- {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} = $2-5B campaign effectiveness

**Game Theory**:

When everyone profits from cooperation, resistance becomes unprofitable:

- Defense lobbyists: {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns > current salary
- Insurance: Healthy people file zero claims
- Pharma: Trials generate revenue, not expenses
- Politicians: Living voters vote more than dead ones
- Public: Gets paid $0.20 to click a button

Capitalism optimizing for the right thing by accident.

## Returns

**Per $1 invested**:

- $27+ annual treaty revenue (forever)
- ${{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 total societal value (lives saved, wealth created, suffering reduced)

**For bondholders**:

- Invest {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} → Receive {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year forever
- {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual returns until the sun explodes

## Transparency

**Live Dashboard** (WarOnDisease.org/budget):

Every paper tracked in real-time:

- Spending by category
- Milestone progress
- Vote counts
- Treaty status
- ROI calculations

**Blockchain Verification**:

- All treasury movements on-chain (anyone can verify)
- Multi-sig wallets (9 of 15 signatures required, no single point of corruption)
- Smart contracts (code executes automatically, no humans to bribe)
- Immutable records (can't delete history)

**Independent Oversight**:

- Quarterly audits (Big 4 accounting firms)
- Monthly reports (bondholders see where papers went)
- Community voting (major changes require approval)
- Open API (anyone can build tracking tools)

## Adaptive Management

Budget reallocates quarterly based on what works. AI optimizes continuously. Humans approve major changes. What doesn't work gets killed. What works gets more papers.

## Summary

{{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} redirects $27.2B annually from the explosion budget to the not-dying budget.

That's a 27:1 return just in redirected military spending.

But the real return:

- Bondholders: $2.7B/year forever ({{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annually)
- Society: ${{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 per dollar (cures, wealth, fewer dead people)
- Humanity: Optional death by 2050
