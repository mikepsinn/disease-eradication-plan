## How to Buy a Planet for {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}}

Traditional campaigns throw papers at problems until the papers or the problems disappear. Usually the papers disappear first.

You're using AI and game theory to do for {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} what normally costs $2-5B. It's like buying everything at Costco but for democracy corruption.

This {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} will:

- Reach 8 billion humans by paying them $0.20 for each referred verified vote (cheaper than advertising, more effective than begging)
- Out-bribe defense lobbyists (they work for whoever pays more)
- Build platforms with AI doing 90% of the work (humans just point and say "not that")
- Make the treaty inevitable in pilot countries, then watch it spread like a virus but helpful

**The Strategy**: Make supporting the treaty more profitable than opposing it. Then sit back and watch greed do the right thing by accident.

## Why {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} Instead of $5B

**Old Way** (throwing papers at humans):

- Lawyers: $100-200M (they charge by the word)
- Software: $250-400M (built by people who've never used software)
- TV ads: {{< var campaign_media_budget_min_millions >}}-{{< var campaign_media_budget_max_billions >}} (screaming at people during football)
- Lobbyists: $400-600M (professional democracy corrupters)
- **Total: $1.25-2.2B** (enough to cure several diseases, ironically)

**Your Way** (AI + Incentives):

- AI lawyers + human review: {{< var campaign_legal_ai_budget_millions >}} (robots draft, humans fix the stupid parts)
- AI-coded platforms: {{< var campaign_platform_development_millions >}} (GitHub but with more begging)
- Viral bribes: {{< var campaign_viral_content_budget_millions >}} (humans recruit humans for pocket change)
- Strategic lobbying: {{< var campaign_lobbying_us_millions >}} (bribe only the humans who matter)
- **Total: {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}}** (80% savings, same corruption)

## Where the Papers Go

### 1. Viral Referendum: {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_viral_referendum_billions >}} (20%)

#### Paying Humans to Click

- $0.20 per verified vote people get with their referral link (less than a candy bar, more effective than moral arguments)
- $0.50 for early adopters (first 10M get participation trophy papers)
- $0.10 per recruit (pyramid scheme but for not dying)
- Target: 280M humans clicking "yes I prefer not dying"

**The Clicking Platform**: {{< var campaign_platform_development_millions >}}


- Biometric verification (one vote per meat body)
- 50+ languages (AI translates, humans check for accidental declarations of war)
- Mobile-first (humans glued to phones anyway)

**Viral Content**: {{< var campaign_viral_content_budget_millions >}}

- AI generates memes about death (surprisingly good at this)
- A/B testing until humans can't resist voting
- Local versions (different cultures, same mortality)
- Micro-influencers (people trust strangers with 10K followers more than experts)

**Community Organizing**: {{< var campaign_community_organizing_millions >}}

- 100+ country ambassadors (humans who like organizing other humans)
- Tools for coordination (spreadsheets that don't crash)
- Event support (folding chairs and PowerPoints)

### 2. Professional Bribery: {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_technology_billions >}} (25%)

**Lobbying (AI-Targeted)**: $150M

Here's how professional democracy corruption works:

- AI identifies which humans can be bribed to change laws
- You bribe those specific humans (not all humans, just the useful ones)
- Focus: US ({{< var campaign_lobbying_us_millions >}}), EU ({{< var campaign_lobbying_eu_millions >}}), G20 ({{< var campaign_lobbying_g20_millions >}})
- AI writes the laws, lawyers make them legal-sounding

**Buying Defense Lobbyists**: {{< var campaign_defense_lobbyist_budget_millions >}}

Defense lobbyists currently work for whoever pays them. So you pay them more:

- Top 50 lobbyists get bond offers (become rich by lobbying FOR life instead of death)
- Defense execs get early bond access ({{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} beats their stock options)
- Pension funds get fiduciary obligation (required to take best returns, oops)
- "Consulting fees" to Pentagon retirees (it's not bribery if you call it consulting)

**Super PAC Papers**: {{< var campaign_super_pac_budget_millions >}}

- AI finds swing districts (where papers matter most)
- Targeted ads (you see "cure cancer," your neighbor sees "lower taxes")
- Voter education (facts presented as if they matter)

**Opposition Research**: {{< var campaign_opposition_research_millions >}}

- AI monitors what opponents say (robots never sleep)
- Instant fact-checking (faster than humans can lie)
- Protect treaty supporters (politics is mean, apparently)

### 3. Technology: {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_technology_billions >}} (25%)

**dFDA Platform**: $120M

The actual product - Amazon for clinical trials:

- AI writes 60% of code (humans fix the bugs AI introduces while fixing bugs)
- Clinical trial matching (sick people find treatments, treatments find sick people)
- Real-world effectiveness tracking (what actually works vs what companies claim works)
- Integration with existing health systems (designed by different companies who hate each other)

**Wishocracy Platform**: $70M

Direct democracy except it works:

- Voting system (humans click things, system counts accurately)
- Identity verification (one human = one vote, revolutionary concept)
- Works in 50+ languages (math is universal, opinions are local)
- Built on open source (free code from people smarter than you)

**dFDA Cloud Infrastructure**: {{< var campaign_infrastructure_millions >}}

Computers that store everything:

- 5-year hosting for 8 billion humans (costs less than one bomber)
- Global CDN (fast loading even in places with bad internet)
- Security (keeping out humans who like breaking things)
- Backups of backups (paranoia as a service)

**Pilot Programs**: {{< var campaign_pilot_programs_millions >}}

- Test in 2 small countries first (if it breaks, fewer people notice)
- 100K beta users (find problems before 8 billion users do)
- Security audits (pay hackers to break it before bad hackers do)

### 4. Lawyers (AI-Assisted): {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_partnerships_billions >}} (10%)

**Legal Work**: {{< var campaign_legal_work_millions >}}

- AI drafts everything (500 pages in 5 minutes)
- Lawyers review (fix the parts that would cause prison)
- International treaty law (experts in papers that countries sign then ignore)
- Multi-country compliance (each country has different rules for the same bribery)

**Regulatory Navigation**: {{< var campaign_regulatory_navigation_millions >}}

- Campaign finance compliance in 50+ countries (bribery is legal if you file the right forms)
- AI monitors rule changes (governments change rules constantly)
- Risk management (avoid prison)

**Legal Defense**: {{< var campaign_legal_defense_millions >}}

- Fund for when they sue you anyway (they will)
- Insurance (in case fund isn't enough)
- Whistleblower protection (pay people to report your own violations before others do)

### 5. Co-opting the Opposition: {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_partnerships_billions >}} (10%)

**Defense Industry Conversion**: {{< var campaign_defense_conversion_millions >}}

Turn enemies into allies through superior returns:

- VICTORY Bonds for key players ({{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} beats their current profits)
- Pension fund outreach (fiduciary duty requires taking best returns)
- Board members as "advisors" (pay them to shut up)

**Healthcare Industry Alignment**: {{< var campaign_healthcare_alignment_millions >}}

- Insurance companies (healthy people = fewer claims = more profit)
- Hospitals (integrated trials = patients pay them instead)
- Pharma (trials become profit centers, not cost centers)
- Medical devices (new markets for gadgets)

**Tech Partnerships**: {{< var campaign_tech_partnerships_millions >}}

- AI/ML infrastructure (they have servers, you need servers)
- Cloud credits (free computers from companies with too many computers)
- Open source (programmers work for free if you ask nicely)

**Celebrity Endorsements**: {{< var campaign_celebrity_endorsement_millions >}}

- Famous people saying things (humans listen to famous people)
- Scientists with credentials (humans trust credentials)
- Cultural influencers (humans who influence culture, apparently)

### 6. Operations: {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_reserve_billions >}} (5%)

**Core Team**: {{< var campaign_staff_budget_millions >}}

- 20-30 leaders (AI-augmented means fewer humans needed)
- 50 regional directors (not 500, AI handles coordination)
- Remote-first (no expensive offices, just Zoom)

**Infrastructure**: {{< var campaign_infrastructure_millions >}}

- Virtual offices (Slack channels cost less than buildings)
- AI assistants (robots that schedule meetings)
- Minimal travel (video calls work, flying is wasteful)

**Contingency**: {{< var campaign_contingency_millions >}}

Papers for when plans fail (plans always fail somewhere)

### 7. Post-Victory Transition: {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_reserve_billions >}} (5%)

**Treaty Implementation**: {{< var campaign_treaty_implementation_millions >}}

- Help countries implement what they signed (signing is easy, implementing is hard)
- Dispute resolution (countries argue, you mediate)
- Coordination (herding cats but the cats are nations)

**Scaling Preparation**: {{< var campaign_scaling_prep_millions >}}

- DIH treasury setup (where the money lives)
- dFDA scaling blueprints (instructions for going from 100K to 8B users)
- Governance launch (democratic system that actually works)

## Timeline

**Year 1** ({{< var campaign_phase1_budget_millions >}}): Proof it works

- 50M humans vote yes
- 2 countries sign
- Platform doesn't crash

**Years 2-3** ({{< var campaign_phase2_budget_millions >}}): Scale

- 280M total votes
- 20+ countries negotiating treaties
- Platform handles global traffic

**Years 4-5** ($300M): Victory

- 100+ countries signed
- Major powers committed
- DIH operational
- Death becomes optional

## Why This Works

**Math**:

- AI + viral mechanics = 80% cost reduction
- $0.20/vote vs $5-15 traditional advertising
- 500 humans + AI = 5,000-person traditional campaign
- {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} = $2-5B campaign effectiveness

**Game Theory**:

When everyone profits from cooperation, resistance becomes unprofitable:

- Defense lobbyists: {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns > current salary
- Insurance: Healthy people file zero claims
- Pharma: Trials generate revenue, not expenses
- Politicians: Living voters vote more than dead ones
- Public: Gets paid $0.20 to click a button

Capitalism optimizing for the right thing by accident.

## Returns

**Per $1 invested**:

- $27+ annual treaty revenue (forever)
- $463 total societal value (lives saved, wealth created, suffering reduced)

**For bondholders**:

- Invest {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} → Receive {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year forever
- {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual returns until the sun explodes

## Transparency

**Live Dashboard** (WarOnDisease.org/budget):

Every paper tracked in real-time:

- Spending by category
- Milestone progress
- Vote counts
- Treaty status
- ROI calculations

**Blockchain Verification**:

- All treasury movements on-chain (anyone can verify)
- Multi-sig wallets (9 of 15 signatures required, no single point of corruption)
- Smart contracts (code executes automatically, no humans to bribe)
- Immutable records (can't delete history)

**Independent Oversight**:

- Quarterly audits (Big 4 accounting firms)
- Monthly reports (bondholders see where papers went)
- Community voting (major changes require approval)
- Open API (anyone can build tracking tools)

## Adaptive Management

Budget reallocates quarterly based on what works. AI optimizes continuously. Humans approve major changes. What doesn't work gets killed. What works gets more papers.

## Summary

{{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} redirects $27.2B annually from the explosion budget to the not-dying budget.

That's a 27:1 return just in redirected military spending.

But the real return:

- Bondholders: $2.7B/year forever ({{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annually)
- Society: $463 per dollar (cures, wealth, fewer dead people)
- Humanity: Optional death by 2050

The question isn't whether {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} is enough.

The question is whether you can afford NOT to spend it.

Every day you wait:

- {{< var qalys_from_prevention_optimistic >}} humans stop existing
- $6.5B wasted on murder toys
- Cures that could exist don't

This budget funds the infrastructure to redirect {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually from funding war to curing disease. It's not a campaign budget. It's the price of convincing humanity to stop killing itself.

Which is surprisingly cheap.
