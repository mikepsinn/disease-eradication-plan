Most financial plans are complicated because the people writing them are either confused or lying. This one is complicated because moving $27 billion annually from military budgets to disease eradication while generating perpetual returns for investors actually IS complicated.

But the architecture is clean: Raise $1B. Spend it to pass the treaty. Manage $27B+ annually forever.

Three financial pillars. That's it.

For detailed breakdowns, see the linked documents. For the overview that explains why this works, keep reading.

## The Three Financial Pillars

### 1. Fundraising: How To Raise $1.0B

**Instrument:** [VICTORY Social Impact Bonds](victory-bonds.qmd)

- **Target Returns:** {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annually, perpetually
- **Structure:** Debt instrument, senior to all other claims
- **Payout:** 10% of all DIH treaty inflows (2.7B/year)
- **Protection:** Bondholders paid before mission spending
- **Collateral:** {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}+ annual treaty revenue stream
- **The Pitch:** "Invest $1B. Get {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year. Forever."

#### Why This Works

- Simplest pitch in finance: {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual returns, perpetual
- Clean {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} target (vs confusing $1.2-2.5B range)
- 10% payout is easy math (vs 5% complex calculations)
- "Forever" beats any finite timeline
- Better returns than any investment in history

**Timeline:** 12-24 months to raise $1.0B (simplified structure accelerates fundraising)

### 2. Campaign Budget: How To Spend $1.0B

**Detailed Breakdown:** [Campaign Budget](campaign-budget.qmd)

The one-time "activation energy" to pass the 1% Treaty, made affordable through AI and viral mechanics:

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Global Referendum** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_referendum >}} | Viral referral system ($0.20-2.00/vote tiered), 280M votes, platform development. [Scenario analysis](campaign-budget.qmd#base-case-scenario): $140M-$406M |
| **Political Lobbying** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}} | AI-targeted campaigns (US/EU/G20), Super PACs, MIC conversion, legal/compliance. Outspends pharma + MIC |
| **Reserve Fund** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_reserve >}} | Post-passage transition, contingency buffer |

#### Key Innovations

- **AI does most of the work**: 60-80% cost reduction vs traditional campaigns
- **Viral mechanics**: $0.20/vote vs $5-15 traditional cost per voter
- **Strategic focus**: 20 high-impact countries, not all 195
- **Result**: {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} achieves what would cost $2-5B traditionally

**Timeline:** 36-60 months from first funding to treaty passage

### 3. Treasury Management: How To Manage {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}+ Annually

Once the treaty passes, {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} flows annually from military budgets to the DIH treasury.

#### Revenue Sources

**Primary:** 1% Treaty ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually)

- 100+ nations contribute 1% of military budgets
- Verified via satellite imagery and blockchain receipts
- Penalties for non-compliance enforced via smart contracts

#### Growth Path

- Year 1-3: 1% Treaty ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}})
- Year 4-7: 2% Treaty ($54B) - public demands expansion
- Year 8-10: 5% Treaty ($135B) - exponential success
- Year 10+: 10%+ ($270B+) - war becomes obsolete

#### Expenditure Allocation

#### The Only Fixed Cost (10%)

- VICTORY bond returns: 2.7B annually (10% of treaty inflows)
- Sacred and untouchable (or investors walk)
- Automatically distributed via smart contracts
- {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual returns to bondholders

##### Everything Else (90%): Decided by Wishocracy

Instead of committees, 8 billion humans vote via pairwise comparisons:

> "Patient subsidies for cancer trials" vs "Infrastructure for rural access"
> *Swipe to allocate: 70% / 30%*

Billions of micro-decisions aggregate into humanity's true priorities.

**Probable Emergent Allocation (based on human nature):**

- **Patient Subsidies (65-75%):** People vote to subsidize their own treatments
- **Infrastructure (10-20%):** Only as much as necessary to keep platform running
- **Research Incentives (10-15%):** Prizes for first-to-cure, breakthrough bonuses
- **Expansion Campaigns (variable):** Growing treasury through bigger treaties

#### Anti-Corruption Built In

- Can't bribe 8 billion people
- Can't capture a system with no center
- Can't redirect funds without majority vote
- Can't build $600M headquarters (looking at you, CDC)

#### Dynamic Patient Subsidies

**The Revolutionary Part:** The DIH doesn't pay researchers. It subsidizes patients.

#### How It Works

```
Base Subsidy = Total Treasury ÷ Active Trial Participants

Example with 1M participants:

{{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} ÷ 1M = $27,000 per patient per year

As more patients join:

5M participants = $5,400 per patient
10M participants = $2,700 per patient
```

#### Why This Creates Perfect Incentives

- Patients organize to grow treasury (2% treaty = double subsidies)
- Researchers compete to attract patients (better trials win)
- Insurance companies save money (trials cheaper than chronic care)
- Everyone wants more people in trials (network effects)

#### Compare to Grant System

- NIH grants: 6 months of proposal writing, committees decide, universities take 40% overhead
- DIH subsidies: Patient wants treatment, joins trial, funds follow automatically, zero overhead

## Financial Performance Metrics

### Return on Investment (The {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 Recommended Multiplier)

#### Direct Investment Returns (VICTORY Social Impact Bonds)

- {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annually to bondholders
- Perpetual returns (not 10-year finite)
- {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} investment → {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year forever
- Better than every investment in human history

#### Societal Returns (Everyone Else)

- ${{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 in value created per dollar spent (PRIMARY estimate)
- {{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}× reduction in trial costs ($50.0B annual savings)
- 10-year acceleration in drug development ($5.4T productivity)
- 100X more diseases addressed (10M lives saved annually)
- 3X ROI on prevention vs treatment ({{< var caregiver_annual_value_total >}} saved)
- Knowledge compounds through open data ($2.1T avoided waste)

##### Total 10-Year Value Creation: $16.4T

That's more than China's entire GDP.

## The Compound Flywheel

```{python}
#| fig-alt: "Flowchart: 1% Treaty → Subsidize Patients → Generate Cures → Save Lives → Media Frenzy → Public Demands 2% → Treasury Doubles → More Cures → More Lives → Nobel Prizes → 5% Treaty Inevitable → Death Optional by 2050"
import graphviz
from pathlib import Path
from IPython.display import Image as IPImage, display

from dih_models.plotting.graphviz_helper import setup_graphviz_style, render_graphviz_with_watermark

dot = graphviz.Digraph(comment='Compound Flywheel', format='png')
dot.attr(rankdir='TD', size='10,14')
setup_graphviz_style(dot)

dot.node('A', f'1% Treaty: {format_parameter_value(TREATY_ANNUAL_FUNDING)}')
dot.node('B', 'Subsidize Patients')
dot.node('C', 'Generate Cures')
dot.node('D', 'Save Lives')
dot.node('E', 'Media Frenzy')
dot.node('F', 'Public Demands 2%')
dot.node('G', 'Treasury Doubles')
dot.node('H', 'More Cures')
dot.node('I', 'More Lives')
dot.node('J', 'Nobel Prizes')
dot.node('K', '5% Treaty Inevitable')
dot.node('L', 'Death Optional by 2050')

dot.edge('A', 'B')
dot.edge('B', 'C')
dot.edge('C', 'D')
dot.edge('D', 'E')
dot.edge('E', 'F')
dot.edge('F', 'G')
dot.edge('G', 'H')
dot.edge('H', 'I')
dot.edge('I', 'J')
dot.edge('J', 'K')
dot.edge('K', 'L')

png_path = render_graphviz_with_watermark(dot, 'compound-flywheel')
display(IPImage(str(png_path)))
```

Each success makes the next success easier:

- More cures → More political support
- Bigger treasury → Lower cost per patient
- Better data → Smarter allocation
- Healthier people → Stronger economy
- Stronger economy → Bigger treaties
- Repeat until paradise
