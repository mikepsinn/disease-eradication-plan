Most financial plans are complicated because the people writing them are either confused or lying. This one is complicated because moving $27 billion annually from military budgets to disease eradication while generating perpetual returns for investors actually IS complicated.

But the architecture is clean: Raise $1B. Spend it to pass the treaty. Manage $27B+ annually forever.

Three financial pillars. That's it.

For detailed breakdowns, see the linked documents. For the overview that explains why this works, keep reading.

## The Three Financial Pillars

### 1. Fundraising: How To Raise $1.0B

**Instrument:** [VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds](victory-bonds.qmd)

- **Target Returns:** {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annually, perpetually
- **Structure:** Debt instrument, senior to all other claims
- **Payout:** {{< var victory_bond_funding_pct >}} of all 1% Treaty Fund inflows ({{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year)
- **Protection:** Bondholders paid before mission spending
- **Collateral:** {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}+ annual treaty revenue stream
- **The Pitch:** "Invest $1B. Get {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year. Forever."

#### Why This Works

- Simplest pitch in finance: {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual returns, perpetual
- Clean {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} target (vs confusing $1.2-2.5B range)
- {{< var victory_bond_funding_pct >}} payout is easy math (vs 5% complex calculations)
- "Forever" beats any finite timeline
- Better returns than any investment in history

**Timeline:** 12-24 months to raise $1.0B (simplified structure accelerates fundraising)

### 2. Campaign Budget: How To Spend $1.0B

**Detailed Breakdown:** [Campaign Budget](campaign-budget.qmd)

The one-time "activation energy" to pass a 1% treaty, made affordable through AI and viral mechanics:

| Category | Amount | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Global Referendum** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_referendum >}} | Viral referral system ($0.20-2.00/vote tiered), 280M votes, platform development. [Scenario analysis](campaign-budget.qmd#base-case-scenario): $140M-$406M |
| **Political Lobbying** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}} | AI-targeted campaigns (US/EU/G20), Super PACs, MIC conversion, legal/compliance. Outspends pharma + MIC |
| **Reserve Fund** | {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_reserve >}} | Post-passage transition, contingency buffer |

#### Key Innovations

- **AI does most of the work**: 60-80% cost reduction vs traditional campaigns
- **Viral mechanics**: $0.20/vote vs $5-15 traditional cost per voter
- **Strategic focus**: 20 high-impact countries, not all 195
- **Result**: {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} achieves what would cost $2-5B traditionally

**Timeline:** 36-60 months from first funding to treaty passage

### 3. Treasury Management: How To Manage {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}+ Annually

Once the treaty passes, {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} flows annually from military budgets to the 1% Treaty Fund.

#### Revenue Sources

**Primary:** 1% treaty ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually)

- 100+ nations contribute 1% of military budgets
- Verified via satellite imagery and blockchain receipts
- Penalties for non-compliance enforced via smart contracts

#### Growth Path

- Year 1-3: 1% treaty ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}})
- Year 4-7: 2% Treaty ($54B) - public demands expansion
- Year 8-10: 5% Treaty ($135B) - exponential success
- Year 10+: 10%+ ($270B+) - war becomes obsolete

#### Expenditure Allocation

The 1% Treaty Fund uses an **80/10/10 automatic allocation** before any funds reach discretionary spending:

| Allocation | Percentage | Annual Amount | Purpose |
|------------|------------|---------------|---------|
| **Pragmatic Clinical Trials & Platform** | {{< var dih_treasury_medical_research_pct >}} | {{< var dih_treasury_to_medical_research_annual >}} | Patient subsidies, research, platform |
| **VICTORY Bond Returns** | {{< var victory_bond_funding_pct >}} | {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}} | Perpetual investor payments |
| **IAB Political Incentives** | {{< var iab_political_incentive_funding_pct >}} | {{< var iab_political_incentive_funding_annual >}} | Rewards for supporting legislators |

#### The Fixed Costs ({{< var victory_bond_funding_pct >}} + {{< var iab_political_incentive_funding_pct >}} = 20%)

- **VICTORY bond returns:** {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}} annually ({{< var victory_bond_funding_pct >}} of treaty inflows)
- **IAB political incentives:** {{< var iab_political_incentive_funding_annual >}} annually ({{< var iab_political_incentive_funding_pct >}} of treaty inflows)
- Both are sacred and untouchable (or the system fails)
- Automatically distributed via smart contracts
- {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual returns to bondholders

##### Everything Else ({{< var dih_treasury_medical_research_pct >}}): Decided by Wishocracy

Instead of committees, 8 billion humans vote via pairwise comparisons:

> "Patient subsidies for cancer trials" vs "Infrastructure for rural access"
> *Swipe to allocate: 70% / 30%*

Billions of micro-decisions aggregate into humanity's true priorities.

**Probable Emergent Allocation (based on human nature):**

- **Patient Subsidies (65-75%):** People vote to subsidize their own treatments
- **Infrastructure (10-20%):** Only as much as necessary to keep platform running
- **Research Incentives (10-15%):** Prizes for first-to-cure, breakthrough bonuses
- **Expansion Campaigns (variable):** Growing treasury through bigger treaties

#### Anti-Corruption Built In

- Can't bribe 8 billion people
- Can't capture a system with no center
- Can't redirect funds without majority vote
- Can't build $600M headquarters (looking at you, CDC)

#### Dynamic Patient Subsidies

**The revolutionary part:** your decentralized institutes of health don't pay researchers. They subsidize patients.

#### How It Works

```
Base Subsidy = Total Treasury ÷ Active Trial Participants

Example with 1M participants:

{{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} ÷ 1M = $27,000 per patient per year

As more patients join:

5M participants = $5,400 per patient
10M participants = $2,700 per patient
```

#### Why This Creates Perfect Incentives

- Patients organize to grow treasury (2% treaty = double subsidies)
- Researchers compete to attract patients (better trials win)
- Insurance companies save money (trials cheaper than chronic care)
- Everyone wants more people in trials (network effects)

#### Compare to Grant System

- NIH grants: 6 months of proposal writing, committees decide, universities take 40% overhead
- Subsidies via your decentralized institutes of health: Patient wants treatment, joins trial, funds follow automatically, zero overhead

## Risk Management

For detailed risk analysis, see **[Investor Risk Analysis](../appendix/investor-risk-analysis.qmd)**.

Key protections:

- **Assurance contracts:** Funds escrowed until milestones hit, automatic refund if targets missed
- **Milestone-based release:** Phased funding tied to platform launch, user growth, and treaty progress
- **Downside protection:** Even partial treaty adoption ($13B) returns 130% annually to bondholders
- **Smart contract security:** Multi-sig wallets, time-locked withdrawals, independent audits
- **On-chain transparency:** All treasury movements public, anyone can audit independently
