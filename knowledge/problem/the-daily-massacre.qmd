Every single day:

- **{{< var global_daily_deaths_curable_diseases >}} people stop existing**
- **130,000 from disease** (diseases are very effective at their job)
- **[80,000 were preventable](../references.qmd#53-percent-preventable-deaths)** (we had the technology, we just chose not to use it)
- **[13,700 are children](../references.qmd#5-million-annual-child-deaths)** (which matters if you believe children should continue existing)

That's fifty 9/11s. Every. Single. Day.

After the first 9/11, America invaded two countries and spent $2 trillion. After the fifty daily 9/11s, humanity shrugs and checks Instagram.

When one thing kills 3,000 people, it's a tragedy and we declare war. When diseases kill 50 times that every day, it's called "natural causes," which is Latin for "we couldn't be bothered to prevent it."

If aliens were studying us, they'd conclude we can count to 3,000 but not 150,000. This would explain a lot about our civilization.

#### The Math Of Death

Every hour: **6,250 deaths**. Every minute: **104 deaths**. Every second: **1.7 deaths**.

The technology to prevent most of this exists. It's currently busy building missiles instead. By the time you finish this chapter, approximately **500 people** will have died from diseases we could have cured if we weren't so invested in building better ways to explode.
