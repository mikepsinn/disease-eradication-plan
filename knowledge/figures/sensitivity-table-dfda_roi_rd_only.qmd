Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| dFDA Annual OPEX | -4.4758 | Strong driver |
| dFDA NPV Upfront Cost Total | 3.6686 | Strong driver |
| dFDA R&D Gross Savings Annual | 1.0305 | Strong driver |
