**Sensitivity Indices for Years Lived with Disability During Disease Eradication Delay**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Regulatory Delay Suffering Period Years | 2.9647 | Strong driver |
| Disease Eradication Delay Deaths Total | -2.7522 | Strong driver |
| Chronic Disease Disability Weight | 0.7729 | Strong driver |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
