**Sensitivity Indices for Years Lived with Disability During Disease Eradication Delay**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Regulatory Delay Suffering Period Years | 1359810810.9798 | Strong driver |
| Disease Eradication Delay Deaths Total | -1005476346.7401 | Strong driver |
| Chronic Disease Disability Weight | 122407018.0447 | Strong driver |

*Interpretation*: Higher absolute values indicate stronger influence. Coefficients show the change in output per unit change in input (standardized).
