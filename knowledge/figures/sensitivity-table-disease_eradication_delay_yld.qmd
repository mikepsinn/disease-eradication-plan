**Sensitivity Indices for Years Lived with Disability During Disease Eradication Delay**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Regulatory Delay Suffering Period Years | 185749859.8411 | Strong driver |
| Chronic Disease Disability Weight | 170581873.1188 | Strong driver |
| Disease Eradication Delay Deaths Total | 85358473.6695 | Strong driver |

*Interpretation*: Higher absolute values indicate stronger influence. Coefficients show the change in output per unit change in input (standardized).
