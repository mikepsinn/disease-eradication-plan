**Sensitivity Indices for Years Lived with Disability During Disease Eradication Delay**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Regulatory Delay Suffering Period Years | 189286309.5441 | Strong driver |
| Chronic Disease Disability Weight | 169863860.1173 | Strong driver |
| Disease Eradication Delay Deaths Total | 86133861.9389 | Strong driver |

*Interpretation*: Higher absolute values indicate stronger influence. Coefficients show the change in output per unit change in input (standardized).
