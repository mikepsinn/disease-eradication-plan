**Sensitivity Indices for Decentralized Framework for Drug Assessment Annual Net Savings (R&D Only)**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| dFDA R&D Gross Savings Annual | 1.0008 | Strong driver |
| dFDA Annual OPEX | -0.0010 | Minimal effect |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
