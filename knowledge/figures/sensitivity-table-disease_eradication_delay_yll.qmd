**Sensitivity Indices for Years of Life Lost from Disease Eradication Delay**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Global Life Expectancy 2024 | 3.6252 | Strong driver |
| Regulatory Delay Mean Age Of Death | -2.7624 | Strong driver |
| Disease Eradication Delay Deaths Total | 0.1343 | Weak driver |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
