**Sensitivity Indices for Total Annual Cost of War Worldwide**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Global Annual War Direct Costs Total | 0.6753 | Strong driver |
| Global Annual War Indirect Costs Total | 0.3731 | Moderate driver |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
