**Sensitivity Indices for Total Annual Human Life Losses from Conflict**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Global Annual Human Cost Active Combat | 0.9500 | Strong driver |
| Global Annual Human Cost Terror Attacks | 0.0365 | Minimal effect |
| Global Annual Human Cost State Violence | 0.0152 | Minimal effect |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
