## PRE-IAB: Rankings Ignored

![NSV rankings exist but don't affect politician utility, which is driven by lobbying intensity from concentrated interests.](utility-function-pre-iab.png){#fig-utility-pre-iab}

## POST-IAB: Rankings Operative

![The same NSV rankings now determine politician scores, which drive electoral support, post-office opportunities, and legacy benefits.](utility-function-post-iab.png){#fig-utility-post-iab}

**Key Insight:** The IAB mechanism does not require politicians to become better people or to care about social welfare intrinsically. It simply redirects their existing selfish utility maximization toward welfare-improving outcomes.

**Same selfish optimization, radically different equilibrium.** This is the core mechanism design contribution.
