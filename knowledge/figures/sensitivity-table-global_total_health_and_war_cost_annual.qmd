**Sensitivity Indices for Total Annual Cost of War and Disease with All Externalities**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Global Disease Economic Burden Annual | 0.8855 | Strong driver |
| Global Annual War Total Cost | 0.0803 | Minimal effect |
| Global Symptomatic Disease Treatment Annual | 0.0406 | Minimal effect |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
