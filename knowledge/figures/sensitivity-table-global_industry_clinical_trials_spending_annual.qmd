**Sensitivity Indices for Annual Global Industry Spending on Clinical Trials**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Global Clinical Trials Spending Annual | 1.0775 | Strong driver |
| Global Government Clinical Trials Spending Annual | -0.0781 | Minimal effect |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
