**Sensitivity Indices for Total Economic Burden of Disease Globally**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Global Disease Human Life Value Loss Annual | 0.8628 | Strong driver |
| Global Disease Direct Medical Cost Annual | 0.0915 | Minimal effect |
| Global Disease Productivity Loss Annual | 0.0458 | Minimal effect |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
