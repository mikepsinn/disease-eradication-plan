**Sensitivity Indices for Total Annual Direct War Costs**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Global Annual Human Life Losses Conflict | 0.6510 | Strong driver |
| Global Annual Infrastructure Destruction Conflict | 0.2801 | Weak driver |
| Global Military Spending Annual 2024 | 0.1708 | Weak driver |
| Global Annual Trade Disruption Conflict | 0.0922 | Minimal effect |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
