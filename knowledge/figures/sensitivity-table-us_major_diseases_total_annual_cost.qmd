**Sensitivity Indices for US Major Diseases Total Annual Cost**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| US Alzheimers Annual Cost | 0.6352 | Strong driver |
| US Heart Disease Annual Cost | 0.2387 | Weak driver |
| US Diabetes Annual Cost | 0.1329 | Weak driver |
| US Cancer Annual Cost | -0.0067 | Minimal effect |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
