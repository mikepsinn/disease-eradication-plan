**Sensitivity Indices for US Major Diseases Total Annual Cost**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| US Heart Disease Annual Cost | 0.4544 | Moderate driver |
| US Diabetes Annual Cost | 0.3853 | Moderate driver |
| US Cancer Annual Cost | 0.0853 | Minimal effect |
| US Alzheimers Annual Cost | 0.0749 | Minimal effect |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
