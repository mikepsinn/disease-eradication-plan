**Sensitivity Indices for Annual Savings from 1% Reduction in Lost Economic Growth**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Global Annual Lost Economic Growth Military Spending | 1.0000 | Strong driver |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
