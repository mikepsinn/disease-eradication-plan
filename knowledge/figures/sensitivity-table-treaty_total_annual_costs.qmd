**Sensitivity Indices for Total Annual Treaty System Costs**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Treaty Campaign Annual Cost Amortized | 0.9158 | Strong driver |
| dFDA Annual OPEX | 0.0856 | Minimal effect |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
