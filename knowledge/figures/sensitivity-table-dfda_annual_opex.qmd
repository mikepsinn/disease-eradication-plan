**Sensitivity Indices for Total Annual Decentralized Framework for Drug Assessment Operational Costs**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| dFDA OPEX Platform Maintenance | 0.3542 | Moderate driver |
| dFDA OPEX Staff | 0.2355 | Weak driver |
| dFDA OPEX Infrastructure | 0.2060 | Weak driver |
| dFDA OPEX Regulatory | 0.1469 | Weak driver |
| dFDA OPEX Community | 0.0576 | Minimal effect |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
