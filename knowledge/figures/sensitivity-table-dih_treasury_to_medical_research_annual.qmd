**Sensitivity Indices for DIH Annual Funding for Medical Research**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Treaty Annual Funding | 1.0000 | Strong driver |
| Victory Bond Annual Payout | 0.0000 | Minimal effect |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
