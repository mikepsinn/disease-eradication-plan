**Sensitivity Indices for Annual Funding for Pragmatic Clinical Trials**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Treaty Annual Funding | 0.3333 | Moderate driver |
| Iab Political Incentive Funding Annual | 0.3333 | Moderate driver |
| Victory Bond Annual Payout | 0.3333 | Moderate driver |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
