**Sensitivity Indices for Medical Research Spending as Percentage of Total Disease Burden**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Global Med Research Spending | -0.5317 | Strong driver |
| Global Total Health And War Cost Annual | -0.4628 | Moderate driver |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
