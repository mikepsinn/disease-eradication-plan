**Sensitivity Indices for Patients Fundable Annually**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Recovery Trial Cost Per Patient | -1.3662 | Strong driver |
| 1% Treaty Fund Trial Subsidies Annual | 0.4126 | Moderate driver |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
