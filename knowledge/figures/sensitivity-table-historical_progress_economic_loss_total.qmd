**Sensitivity Indices for Total Economic Loss from Historical Progress Delays**

Regression-based sensitivity showing which inputs explain the most variance in the output.

| Input Parameter | Sensitivity Coefficient | Interpretation |
|:----------------|------------------------:|:---------------|
| Regulatory Delay Mean Age Of Death | -1.3565 | Strong driver |
| Global Life Expectancy 2024 | 1.1667 | Strong driver |
| Standard Economic QALY Value Usd | 0.8086 | Strong driver |
| Historical Progress Deaths Total | 0.3807 | Moderate driver |

*Interpretation*: Standardized coefficients show the change in output (in SD units) per 1 SD change in input. Values near ±1 indicate strong influence; values exceeding ±1 may occur with correlated inputs.
