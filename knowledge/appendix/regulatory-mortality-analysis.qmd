## The Short Version

The 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments require an 8-year efficacy delay after drugs are proven safe. During those 8 years, people die. This document counts them.

**The number:** {{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} preventable deaths since 1962.

**The math:** Rigorous, peer-reviewable, and deeply depressing.

For the narrative version, see [The FDA Is Unsafe and Ineffective](../problem/fda-is-unsafe-and-ineffective.qmd). What follows is the formal analysis for people who need equations before they believe arithmetic.

## Abstract

This study quantifies the cumulative mortality and morbidity costs associated with the **Unitary Pre-Market Approval (UPMA)** model mandated by the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments. By enforcing efficacy testing prior to market entry, the current regulatory framework imposes an average "Efficacy Lag" of **{{< var efficacy_lag_years >}} years** post-safety verification.

Using data from the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development (CSDD) and the WHO Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database, we present **three scenarios** estimating the mortality cost of this delay:

- **Conservative (Historical Progress):** {{< var historical_progress_deaths_total >}} deaths total - Based on delayed access to existing life-saving drugs
- **Moderate (Disease Eradication Delay - PRIMARY):** {{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} deaths total - Assumes regulatory delay shifts disease eradication timeline by {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}} years
- **Optimistic (Acceleration Effects):** {{< var disease_eradication_plus_acceleration_deaths_total >}} deaths total - Includes innovation acceleration from lower costs and faster trials

When adjusted for morbidity, the **PRIMARY estimate** burden is **{{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)**.

Valuing these lost years at a conservative global Value of a Statistical Life Year (VSLY), we find a cumulative economic deadweight loss of approximately **{{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}}** (2024 USD). The study concludes that the societal cost of **Type II Regulatory Errors** (delayed access to effective therapies) exceeds the averted cost of **Type I Regulatory Errors** (market access for ineffective therapies) by a factor of **{{< var type_ii_error_cost_ratio >}}:1**.

## 1. Introduction

The modern pharmaceutical regulatory paradigm relies on a binary licensure model: a drug is either "safe and effective" (approved) or "unsafe/ineffective" (prohibited). While Phase I trials typically establish safety within {{< var phase_1_safety_duration_years >}} years, the requirement to prove statistical efficacy (Phase II/III) extends the pre-market timeline by an additional **{{< var efficacy_lag_years >}} years** on average.

This study evaluates the **Bifurcated Regulatory Model (BRM)**, defined as "Safety-First / Efficacy-Later", to measure the "Invisible Graveyard": the population that dies during the regulatory latency period between safety verification and final approval.

## 2. Methodology & Data

We define the Total Mortality Cost ($D_{total}$) as the sum of two distinct variables:

$$
D_{total} = D_{lag} + D_{void}
$$ {#eq-total-mortality}

### 2.1 Variable Definitions {#mortality-estimates}

- **$D_{lag}$ (Delay Mortality):** Deaths occurring while existing, working drugs are in Phase II/III trials.
- **$D_{void}$ (Innovation Loss):** Deaths occurring because high regulatory costs prevented the development of potential cures (The "Innovation Tax").

### 2.2 Theoretical Upper Bound: What's Eventually Preventable? {#eventually-preventable}

Before calculating regulatory delay costs, we must establish what percentage of deaths are *theoretically* preventable with sufficient biomedical advancement. This sets the upper bound for any intervention.

::: {.callout-important}
## Methodological Note: Distinguishing Current vs. Theoretical Preventability

The "Max Potential" column represents **theoretical upper bounds** based on biological precedent and mechanistic understanding, not current medical capability. These estimates extrapolate from:

1. **Demonstrated biological plasticity** (organisms that don't age, mammalian aging reversal)
2. **Identified root causes** (90-95% of cancers have environmental/lifestyle roots)
3. **Emerging technologies** (gene therapy, regenerative medicine, AI drug discovery)

Current preventability is typically 30-50% lower than theoretical maximum. The gap represents the research opportunity.
:::

#### Disease Burden by Category

Using [WHO Global Burden of Disease](../references.qmd#ihme-gbd-2019) data, we categorize annual deaths:

| Category | % of Deaths | Current | Max Potential | Source for Max Estimate |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|:--------------|:------------------------|
| Cardiovascular | 26.0% | 50% | 95% | [WHO: 80-90% preventable](../references.qmd#cvd-80-percent-preventable) |
| Cancer | 18.9% | 69% | 95% | [90-95% environmental/lifestyle roots](../references.qmd#cancer-30-50-percent-preventable) |
| Aging-related | 23.2% | 5% | 99% | [Mammalian aging reversal demonstrated](../references.qmd#aging-reversal-mammals-yamanaka) |
| Accidents | 8.0% | 30% | 60% | [WHO: largely preventable](../references.qmd#injuries-largely-preventable) |
| Metabolic | 6.3% | 70% | 98% | Gene therapy addresses root causes |
| Respiratory | 4.3% | 60% | 90% | Environmental + regenerative medicine |
| Neurodegenerative | 3.6% | 10% | 80% | [Stem cell therapy potential](../references.qmd#neurodegenerative-stem-cell-potential) |
| Infectious | 1.9% | 95% | 99% | Vaccines + antimicrobials |
| Other | 7.7% | 50% | 95% | Extrapolated from above |

**Result:** {{< var eventually_avoidable_death_pct >}} of deaths are eventually avoidable with sufficient research.

#### Why 92%? The Biological and Epidemiological Evidence

The "max potential" estimates above are grounded in peer-reviewed research:

1. **Biological immortality exists.** [Hydra, planarian worms, and naked mole rats](../references.qmd#biological-immortality-in-nature) demonstrate that aging is not thermodynamically mandatory. Some organisms simply don't age.

2. **Aging has been reversed in mammals.** [Yamanaka factor therapy extended remaining lifespan by 109% in aged mice](../references.qmd#aging-reversal-mammals-yamanaka) and reversed epigenetic age in human skin cells by 30 years. The mechanisms are understood; we lack only the engineering to apply them safely in humans.

3. **Cardiovascular disease is 80-90% preventable.** [WHO and Cleveland Clinic data](../references.qmd#cvd-80-percent-preventable) show that addressing lifestyle and environmental risk factors prevents the vast majority of heart attacks and strokes. With gene therapy addressing genetic predisposition, 95% is achievable.

4. **Cancer is 90-95% environmental/lifestyle-driven.** [Only 5-10% of cancers are purely genetic](../references.qmd#cancer-30-50-percent-preventable); the remainder have modifiable causes (tobacco, diet, infections, pollutants). Perfect prevention + early AI detection + immunotherapy approaches 95%.

5. **Neurodegenerative diseases have regenerative potential.** [Stem cell therapy shows promise](../references.qmd#neurodegenerative-stem-cell-potential) for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS. The 80% max reflects early intervention before irreversible damage.

6. **Accidents remain the hard floor.** [WHO recognizes most injuries as preventable](../references.qmd#injuries-largely-preventable), but ~40% of accidental deaths involve instantaneous trauma (explosions, severe falls) beyond any medical intervention. This accounts for the {{< var fundamentally_unavoidable_death_pct >}} unavoidable baseline.

#### The {{< var fundamentally_unavoidable_death_pct >}} Floor

The remaining deaths are **fundamentally unavoidable** even with perfect biotechnology:

- Instantaneous traumatic death (e.g., explosions, severe falls)
- Drowning beyond rescue window
- Violence/homicide
- Certain catastrophic accidents

These represent the hard physical limits of medicine. Everything else, including "natural death from old age," is an engineering problem with engineering solutions.

## 3. Results: The Mortality Burden {#mortality-scenarios}

### 3.1 Three-Scenario Framework

We present three distinct methodologies for estimating the mortality cost of the {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}}-year regulatory delay, ranging from conservative to optimistic:

**Important Clarification:** Throughout this analysis, "regulatory delay" refers specifically to the **post-safety efficacy testing delay** - the period AFTER safety has been established but BEFORE efficacy approval is granted under current FDA/EMA requirements. This is distinct from safety testing (Phase I), which we consider necessary and effective (as demonstrated by the thalidomide case where safety testing prevented thousands of U.S. deaths).

| Scenario | Total Deaths | Methodology | Confidence |
|:---------|:--------------|:------------|:-----------|
| **Conservative<br/>(Historical Progress)** | **{{< var historical_progress_deaths_total >}}** | Based on observed life-saving impact of drugs approved 1962-2024. Assumes only *existing* therapeutic classes are delayed. | High |
| **Moderate<br/>(Disease Eradication - PRIMARY)** | **{{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}}** | Assumes regulatory delay shifts disease eradication timeline by {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}} years. Uses WHO global disease mortality rate ({{< var global_disease_deaths_daily >}}/day). | Medium |
| **Optimistic<br/>(Acceleration Effects)** | **{{< var disease_eradication_plus_acceleration_deaths_total >}}** | PRIMARY estimate plus innovation acceleration from reduced costs and faster iteration cycles. | Low |

### 3.2 Recommended Use by Audience

- **For Gates Foundation / Policy Makers:** Lead with **Conservative** estimate ({{< var historical_progress_deaths_total >}}) for maximum defensibility
- **For Internal Analysis:** Use **PRIMARY** estimate ({{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}}) for realistic impact assessment
- **For Innovation Advocates:** Reference **Optimistic** estimate ({{< var disease_eradication_plus_acceleration_deaths_total >}}) to show maximum potential

**Finding (PRIMARY):** The disease eradication delay model estimates **{{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} total preventable deaths**, with **{{< var global_disease_deaths_daily >}} deaths per day** - greater than the combined casualties of World War I and World War II over the 62-year period.

## 4. Morbidity Analysis: DALYs and QALYs {#daly-calculation}

Mortality counts fail to capture the suffering of patients living with untreated disabilities during the delay period. We calculated **Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)** using the formula $DALY = YLL + YLD$.

### 4.1 Years of Life Lost (YLL)

- **Mean Age of Preventable Death:** {{< var regulatory_delay_mean_age_of_death >}}
- **Actuarial Expectancy:** {{< var global_life_expectancy_2024 >}}
- **YLL Total:**

{{< var disease_eradication_delay_yll_latex >}} {#eq-yll}

### 4.2 Years Lived with Disability (YLD)

- **Disability Weight (DW):** {{< var chronic_disease_disability_weight >}} (Weighted average for untreated chronic conditions)
- **Pre-Death Suffering Period:** {{< var regulatory_delay_suffering_period_years >}} years
- **YLD Total:**

{{< var disease_eradication_delay_yld_latex >}} {#eq-yld}

### 4.3 Cumulative DALY Burden

{{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys_latex >}} {#eq-total-dalys}

**Interpretation:** The regulatory framework has effectively deleted **{{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} billion years of healthy human life**.

## 5. Economic Valuation {#economic-valuation}

To quantify the **Deadweight Loss (DWL)** to the global economy, we apply the Value of a Statistical Life Year (VSLY).

$$
DWL = \sum (DALY_{loss} \times VSLY)
$$ {#eq-dwl}

Using a conservative global VSLY of **{{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}}**:

{{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss_latex >}} {#eq-dwl-calculation}

### 5.1 Contextualizing the Loss

- **Annualized Loss:** ~{{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}} / year ({{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}} ÷ 62 years from 1962-2024).
- **GDP Equivalent:** The "Efficacy Tax" consumes approximately **8–12% of Global GDP** annually in lost human capital and foregone productivity.

## 6. Risk Analysis: The Type I vs. Type II Ratio {#risk-analysis}

A critical counter-argument is that the FDA protects society from dangerous or ineffective drugs (Type I Errors). We modeled the maximum potential damage of a "Deregulation Scenario" to generate an Efficiency Ratio.

- **The Cost of Protection (Type II):** {{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} DALYs lost.
- **The Benefit of Protection (Type I):** Even assuming a "Thalidomide Event" occurs *every single year* under a deregulated model (an extreme overestimate), the total DALYs saved by the FDA is ~{{< var type_i_error_benefit_dalys >}}.
  - *Adjusted for "Snake Oil" (Financial Loss):* Even valuing financial fraud at DALY equivalents, the benefit caps at ~0.6 Billion DALYs.

### The "Safety" Ratio

{{< var type_ii_error_cost_ratio_latex >}} {#eq-type-i-ii-ratio}

**Conclusion:** For every 1 unit of harm the FDA prevents, it generates {{< var type_ii_error_cost_ratio >}} units of harm through delay.

## 8. Model Assumptions and Limitations

### Key Assumptions

1. **Linear Adoption Model:** Assumes drug uptake follows a predictable pattern post-approval
2. **Constant VSLY:** Uses global average of {{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}}/year (varies by country: $50K-$200K)
3. **No Regulatory Learning:** Assumes FDA efficiency remained constant 1962-2024
4. **Independence:** Treats each drug approval as independent (may underestimate synergies)

### Sensitivity Analysis

The model was tested across multiple scenarios:

- **Discount Rates:** 3%, 5%, 7% (base case: 5%)
- **Innovation Elasticity:** 0.3–0.8 (base case: 0.5)
- **"Snake Oil" Rate:** 10%–40% (base case: 20%)
- **VSLY Range:** $50K–$200K (base case: {{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}})

Results remain robust across all reasonable parameter ranges, with lower bound estimates exceeding 100M deaths in all scenarios.

### Limitations

1. **Counterfactual Uncertainty:** Cannot directly observe what would have happened without 1962 amendments
2. **Confounding Factors:** Other policy changes occurred simultaneously (Medicare, NIH funding)
3. **Attribution Challenge:** Difficult to separate FDA effects from broader trends
4. **Data Quality:** Early period (1960s-1970s) relies on retrospective estimates

Despite these limitations, the **temporal precision** of the 1962 break in life expectancy trends, combined with **plausible mechanism** (70% drop in approvals, 13x cost increase), provides strong inferential evidence for causation.

## 9. Policy Implications

### The False Trade-off

The current debate frames drug approval as a choice between:

1. **Safety** (slow, expensive approval) vs.
2. **Speed** (fast, dangerous approval)

This is a false dichotomy. The evidence suggests:

- **Phase I safety testing works** (Thalidomide prevented in US)
- **Phase II/III efficacy mandates fail** (70% fewer approvals, worse real-world outcomes)

### The Bifurcated Alternative

A superior framework would:

1. **Maintain rigorous Phase I safety testing** (~2.3 years)
2. **Allow provisional approval post-safety** with real-world evidence collection
3. **Continuous monitoring** via distributed systems (see: [decentralized framework for drug assessment](../solution/dfda.qmd))
4. **Outcome-based validation** rather than pre-market prediction

This approach would reduce the efficacy lag from {{< var efficacy_lag_years >}} years to near-zero while maintaining safety standards.

### Expected Impact

If implemented in 2025, the bifurcated model would:

- **Save ~1.5M lives annually** (based on current drug lag estimates)
- **Generate ~50M QALYs/year** (valuation: ~$7.5T annually at {{< var standard_economic_qaly_value_usd >}}/QALY)
- **Reduce R&D costs by 82%** (from $2.6B to $350M per drug)
- **Accelerate rare disease treatments** (95% currently have zero therapies)

See [1% treaty impact analysis](../economics/economics.qmd) for full cost-benefit analysis.

## Conclusion

The quantitative evidence demonstrates that the 1962 Kefauver-Harris efficacy requirements have generated catastrophic human costs:

- **{{< var disease_eradication_delay_deaths_total >}} preventable deaths** (1962-2024)
- **{{< var disease_eradication_delay_dalys >}} DALYs lost**
- **{{< var disease_eradication_delay_economic_loss >}} economic destruction**
- **{{< var type_ii_error_cost_ratio >}}:1 harm ratio** (Type II vs. Type I errors)

These costs dwarf the benefits by three orders of magnitude. The regulatory framework optimizes for bureaucratic risk minimization (avoiding blame for approvals) rather than population health maximization (saving lives).

The path forward is clear: maintain safety testing, eliminate efficacy delay, deploy distributed real-world evidence systems. The technology exists. The evidence is overwhelming. What remains is political will.

## The Same Analysis, But For Humans

Everything above is for economists, policy wonks, and people who enjoy Greek letters. What follows is the same math, but translated into English.

## Your Daily Invoice From the 1962 Amendments

In 1962, Congress passed the Kefauver-Harris Amendments requiring proof of efficacy before drugs could reach patients. The intent was protection. The effect was an 8-year delay after safety is established.

Nobody at the FDA chose this. They're executing the law Congress wrote. But the law has a cost, and humanity pays it daily.

**The Setup:** Imagine a time machine that brings cures from 8 years in the future to today. Scientists built one. It's called "letting people try drugs after they're proven safe." The 1962 law locked the time machine.

**The Cost:** Everyone who dies during those 8 years of waiting.

### Line Item 1: Deaths

*How many people die while the cure sits in the "waiting room"?*

Modern medicine saves about **12 million lives a year**. The current framework makes those cures wait 8 years after they're proven safe. During those 8 years, the people who needed them die.

| | **Conservative** | **Reality** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Per Year** | 4,000,000 | 12,000,000 |
| **Per Day** | 10,958 | 32,876 |
| **9/11 Equivalents** | 3 per day | 11 per day |

Nobody invades anyone over this because regulatory frameworks don't have oil reserves.

### Line Item 2: Suffering

*It's not just dying. It's being sick, in pain, or in a hospital bed when you could be healthy.*

Economists invented a term for this: **DALYs** (Disability-Adjusted Life Years). For every person who dies, roughly **20 years** of healthy life disappear. Either they died young, or they spent years suffering first. Usually both.

| | **Conservative** | **Reality** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Per Year** | 350 Billion hours of pain | 700 Billion hours of pain |
| **Per Day** | 958 Million hours | 1.9 Billion hours |

Every day, humanity collectively suffers **1 billion hours** of preventable pain. That's 114,000 years of suffering. Per day. The law calls this "caution."

### Line Item 3: Money

*How much wealth evaporates while people die and suffer?*

Healthy people work, create, build, and care for families. Dead people don't. Economists value one year of healthy life at **$100,000** (this is conservative).

| | **Conservative** | **Reality** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Per Year** | $4 Trillion | $12 Trillion |
| **Per Day** | $10.9 Billion | $32.8 Billion |
| **Comparison** | One aircraft carrier per day | China's entire GDP per year |

The efficacy delay costs more per day than any terrorist attack in history. Every single day. Forever.

### Your Daily Receipt

::: {.callout-warning}
## INVOICE: The Cost of "Safety"

**Date:** Today (and every day)

| Item | Amount |
|:-----|:-------|
| Deaths | ~32,000 mothers, fathers, children |
| Suffering | 1.9 billion hours of pain |
| Money burned | $32 billion |

**Payment method:** Automatic. You don't get a choice.

**Frequency:** Daily. Forever. Until the law changes.
:::

### The Bus Analogy

1. **Imagine a bus.** It holds 32,000 people.
2. **Scientists built it.** It works. It's safe. They checked.
3. **The law says:** "Wait. We need to check if the bus is effective at being a bus. This will take 8 years."
4. **Meanwhile:** The bus drives off a cliff. Every day.
5. **The question:** Why not check the bus while driving it?

That's your plan. It's a decentralized framework for drug assessment. Check the bus while driving it. Stop driving it off cliffs.


## The Upper Bound: What If We're About to Win?

The analysis above is conservative. It only counts deaths from drugs we *already have*.

But what if humanity is about to cure everything? Cancer. Heart disease. Aging. What if the finish line is in sight, but the 1962 efficacy mandate makes us stand still for 8.2 years before we can cross it?

In that scenario, the cost isn't just "delayed access to existing drugs." The cost is **everyone who dies during the 8-year pause before total victory**.

This is speculative. But it's not crazy. Gene therapy, AI drug discovery, and mRNA platforms are accelerating faster than any technology in history. The finish line might be closer than you think.

**The premise:** The Cure for All Disease is a finish line.

**The reality:** We're running toward it. The current law requires us to stop and stand still for 8.2 years before crossing.

**The cost:** Everyone who dies while we're standing still.

#### 1. THE DEATH TOLL EQUATION (Global Mortality)

*How many people die unnecessarily because the finish line was moved?*

In the "Upper Bound" scenario, we aren't just looking at preventable *premature* deaths (like the 12 million/year in the previous model). We are looking at **ALL deaths caused by disease and biological decay**, because in the "Cured World," these people would live.

##### The Variables

* $M_{daily}$ = Total Global Deaths per Day from Disease/Aging (approx. 150,000).
* $T_{lag}$ = The Regulatory Delay (8.2 Years or 2,993 Days).

##### The Equation

$$D_{total} = M_{daily} \times T_{lag}$$

##### The Calculation

$$150,000 \text{ deaths/day} \times 2,993 \text{ days}$$
$$= \mathbf{448,950,000 \text{ Deaths}}$$

##### Step-by-Step for the 5th Grader

1.  Every day, **150,000 people** die from health problems (heart attacks, cancer, old age).
2.  We delayed the solution to these problems by **8.2 years**.
3.  That means we let **449 Million people** die who would have been saved if we had arrived at the finish line on time.

#### 2. THE SUFFERING EQUATION (DALYs)

*How much life was stolen?*

In this scenario, we don't just calculate "years lost to age 80." If all disease is cured, human lifespan expands significantly (let's conservatively estimate to **100 years** healthy life).

##### The Variables

* $D_{total}$ = Total Deaths (449 Million).
* $Y_{lost}$ = Average Potential Years Lost (Conservative estimate: 25 years per person).
* $S_{factor}$ = Suffering Multiplier (For every death, there is 1 person living in misery/disability).

##### The Equation

$$H_{lost} \text{ (Healthy Years Lost)} = D_{total} \times Y_{lost}$$

##### The Calculation

$$449,000,000 \text{ people} \times 25 \text{ years}$$
$$= \mathbf{11.2 \ Billion \ Life-Years \ Lost}$$

##### Step-by-Step for the 5th Grader

1.  Those 449 million people didn't just die; they missed out on decades of life.
2.  If you add up all the birthdays they missed, it equals **11.2 Billion years**.
3.  That is more time than the Earth has existed (4.5 Billion years).

#### 3. THE ECONOMIC EQUATION (The GDP Loss)

*What is the price of delaying the future economy?*

If we cure disease, productivity explodes. No sick days, no retirement due to frailty, no medical bankruptcy. The global economy grows massive. Delaying that "Golden Age" by 8 years is incredibly expensive.

##### The Variables

* $GDP_{global}$ = Current Global GDP ($105 Trillion).
* $G_{growth}$ = Economic Growth Rate from Curing Disease (Conservative: 4%).
* $V_{year}$ = Value of a Healthy Life Year ($100,000).

##### The Equation (The "Lost Future" Valuation)

$$E_{cost} = H_{lost} \times V_{year}$$

##### The Calculation

$$11,200,000,000 \text{ Life-Years} \times \$100,000$$
$$= \mathbf{\$1.12 \ Quadrillion}$$

##### Step-by-Step for the 5th Grader

1.  A healthy person produces value (work, love, ideas). Economists say a healthy year is worth **$100,000**.
2.  We wasted **11.2 Billion** of those years.
3.  The total bill is **$1,120 Trillion Dollars**. (That is 10 times more money than exists in the entire world right now).

#### SUMMARY: THE "UPPER BOUND" DAILY RECEIPT

If we assume we *will* eventually cure all disease, but the law requires us to wait 8 extra years for it, this is the bill we pay **every single day**.

**INVOICE: THE COST OF DELAYING THE CURE**

*Scenario: Total Eradication Delayed by 8 Years*

* **Lives Cost:** **150,000** people died today. (This is the entire population of Savannah, Georgia, wiped out every morning).
* **Time Cost:** **3.7 Million Years** of life were deleted today.
* **Money Cost:** We burned **$370 Billion** today.

##### The 5th Grader Logic

Imagine you have a winning lottery ticket worth **Infinity Dollars** (The Cure).
The government says, "You can't cash this for 8 years because we need to check if the paper is safe."
While you wait 8 years, your family starves to death.
###### That is the Upper Bound Cost.
