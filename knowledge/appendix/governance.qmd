{{< include /knowledge/includes/setup-parameters.qmd >}}

Your [decentralized institutes of health (DIH)](../solution/dih.qmd) is a **decentralized crowdfunding platform** that serves as the single governance layer for all health research funding.

It functions like Kickstarter meets the NIH, but without corruption or bureaucracy - governed by **Wishocracy**, a pairwise allocation voting system that lets 8 billion people collectively decide how to spend {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually.

## DIH Architecture: Single Governance Layer

{{< include ../figures/dih-architecture-diagram.qmd >}}

Your decentralized institutes of health (DIH) handles ALL budgeting decisions:

- Governs the allocation of the [1% Treaty Fund](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) treasury
- Accepts campaign proposals from anyone
- Uses [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) to allocate funds across competing campaigns
- No CEO, no board, governed by transparent code

## Clean Separation: Governance vs Platform

{{< include ../figures/dih-vs-dfda-separation-diagram.qmd >}}

### Your decentralized institutes of health (DIH) (Governance Layer)

- Handles all budget allocation
- Wishocracy voting on campaigns
- Treasury governance
- Prize distribution

**A decentralized framework for drug assessment (dFDA) (Technical Platform)**

- Pure technical infrastructure
- NO budget authority
- Is funded by the 1% Treaty Fund (as directed by DIH governance)
- If captured → fund an alternative platform instead

This prevents the "new FDA" problem: a decentralized framework for drug assessment can't become a bureaucratic bottleneck because it has no independent funding - it's just one campaign competing with others for 1% Treaty Fund funds.

## How Budget Allocation Works

Your decentralized institutes of health (DIH) network uses **[Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd)** - a pairwise voting system - to allocate funds across competing campaign proposals.

**See [Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd) for detailed explanation of how pairwise allocation works.**

### What Gets Funded: Market Failures Only

Since the marketplace enabled by a [decentralized framework for drug assessment (dFDA)](../solution/dfda.qmd) handles most research allocation automatically (patients choose trials → funding flows there), the 1% Treaty Fund primarily funds **market failures** - things the marketplace can't handle:

#### Infrastructure (Platform Must Exist First)

- Development and operations for a decentralized framework for drug assessment (~$10B/year)
- Competing alternative implementations of a decentralized drug assessment framework
- Data commons infrastructure (storage, processing)
- Security audits and fraud detection systems

#### True Public Goods (No Revenue Model)

- Patient trial participation subsidies (~$800B/year, automatic)
- Negative results publishing incentives (no revenue from failures)
- Basic research with no patient application yet (can't be trials)
- Replication studies (unglamorous but critical)

**Why This is Minimal:** The marketplace created by a [decentralized framework for drug assessment](../solution/dfda.qmd) eliminates most traditional research funding needs. Companies register treatments → Patients join trials → Revenue flows → Research happens. Your decentralized institutes of health only needs to direct the 1% Treaty Fund to cover what the marketplace truly can't handle.

## Security & Anti-Corruption: Building Uncorruptible Institutions

**The Challenge:** A {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} treasury is a massive target for hackers, fraudsters, and corrupt actors.

[Traditional DAOs with simple multisig controls have proven vulnerable to both technical exploits and social engineering attacks](../references.qmd#dao-multisig-vulnerabilities).

### The Multi-Layered Defense

1.  **Nobody's in Charge (And That's the Point)**

    *Other organizations that manage billions of dollars this way already exist and work fine.*

    *Turns out you don't need a CEO when you have math.*

    - Every VICTORY bond holder directly controls treasury through on-chain voting (MakerDAO/Uniswap model)
    - No human signers = no kidnapping, corruption, or coercion targets
    - Smart contracts automatically execute community decisions after 24-72h timelocks
    - [Battle-tested approach managing billions in existing DAOs](../references.qmd#makerdao-scale)

2.  **AI-Powered Fraud Detection**

    - Fraud Agent: real-time anomaly detection, duplication monitoring, collusion identification, sybil detection
    - Safety Oracle: incident severity scoring with automatic payout holds for affected interventions
    - Manual review queue for flagged actions with whistleblower bounty rewards
    - Identity Oracle: verifies affiliations and conflicts, prevents unauthorized access

3.  **Complete Transparency & Auditability**

    - All treasury addresses published with real-time public dashboards
    - Immutable transaction logs with standardized disbursement tags
    - Annual smart contract audits and semiannual operational audits with published reports
    - Hash-committed invoices and budgets for full accountability

4.  **Recovery & Response Mechanisms**

    - Clawbacks for data falsification or trial misconduct
    - Emergency pause capabilities triggered by incident signals
    - Progressive unpause policies tied to remediation completion
    - Guardian modules for pausing non-critical functions under defined conditions

### Beyond Medical Research: A Template for Uncorruptible Governance

This isn't just about protecting funding for pragmatic clinical trials and other public health goods – it's an experiment in demonstrating a new model for uncorruptible, transparent governance of public goods.

Using proven DAO models that already manage billions (MakerDAO, Uniswap, Aave), you demonstrate that {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} can be managed with:

- **Zero human targets** for violence, kidnapping, or corruption
- **True community control** through direct token holder governance
- **Complete transparency** with all decisions and executions on-chain
- **Automated efficiency** eliminating bureaucratic waste and political favoritism

#### What Else This Could Fix

*Once you prove you can run a {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} treasury without anyone stealing from it, you can do the same thing for schools, roads, or anything else the government currently screws up.*

- **Education**: Pay teachers based on whether kids actually learn things
- **Infrastructure**: Fund roads that don't immediately fall apart
- **Environment**: Pay for actual carbon reduction, not paperwork
- **Social Services**: Get help to people who need it without 47 forms

**The End State:** Replace corrupt, inefficient bureaucracies with transparent, automated, outcome-driven institutions that actually work and can't be bribed.

The 1% Treaty Fund becomes the prototype for a new era of public governance - one that eliminates human corruption points entirely while delivering measurable results.

This experiment could usher in a new era of peace, prosperity, and abundance by proving that large-scale public goods can be managed through true decentralization without any centralized control points.
