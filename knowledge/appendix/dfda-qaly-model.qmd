## Outdated Methodology

This document describes the **bottom-up incremental QALY model (840,000 QALYs)** which represents marginal improvements within the current regulatory framework.

**For the current primary estimate**, see [Regulatory Mortality Analysis](regulatory-mortality-analysis.qmd), which uses a rigorous top-down approach based on eliminating the 7.2-year efficacy lag. The primary estimate is **{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs annually** (88x larger than this bottom-up estimate).

This document is retained for historical reference and transparency about earlier methodology.
:::

This model provides a transparent basis for the aggregate annual Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) generated by the dFDA Infrastructure using a **component-based bottom-up approach**. The total QALY gain is the sum of three distinct benefit streams, each presented with a conservative, base, and optimistic estimate.

#### A. Accelerating Development of Existing Pipeline Drugs

This stream quantifies the health gains from bringing effective treatments to patients faster. The dFDA Infrastructure is expected to shorten development and approval timelines significantly.

- **Rationale:** a one-year delay in the diffusion of new cancer therapies alone resulted in a loss of **84,000 life-years**. By reducing trial times, the dFDA can recapture this value across the entire pharmaceutical pipeline.
- **Assumptions:**
- **Conservative:** dFDA achieves a modest acceleration, equivalent to the gains seen in the cancer study.
- **Base:** A 2-year average acceleration across a broader range of therapies, including but not limited to oncology.
- **Optimistic:** A more profound acceleration (3+ years) combined with an increased number of successful drugs due to lower trial costs.
- **Annual QALY Estimates:**
- **Conservative:** 90,000 QALYs
- **Base:** **[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs
- **Optimistic:** 500,000 QALYs

#### B. Improving Preventative Care via Real-World Evidence

This stream captures the value of using the dFDA's vast data to optimize preventative care and the use of existing treatments.

- **Rationale:** Research demonstrates that existing cancer screenings have already saved millions of life-years, with much potential still untapped at full adherence. The dFDA Infrastructure can identify at-risk populations and measure the real-world effectiveness of preventative interventions (e.g., statins, diabetes screening, lifestyle changes) at a massive scale.
- **Assumptions:**
- **Conservative:** The platform leads to modest improvements in adherence and targeting for a few key preventative measures.
- **Base:** The platform drives significant uptake and better targeting of established preventative care across multiple chronic diseases.
- **Optimistic:** The platform uncovers new, highly effective preventative strategies and enables their rapid, widespread adoption.
- **Annual QALY Estimates:**
- **Conservative:** **[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs
- **Base:** **[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs
- **Optimistic:** **[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs

#### C. Enabling Research for Previously Untreatable/Neglected Diseases

This stream reflects the transformative potential of the dFDA to create viable research pathways for conditions that are currently ignored due to high trial costs and small patient populations, such as rare diseases.

- **Rationale:** Over 7,000 rare diseases affect 30 million Americans, yet most lack an FDA-approved treatment. The dFDA's radically lower per-patient trial cost makes R&D in this area economically feasible for the first time. A single successful new therapy for a rare disease affecting just 20,000 people could generate over **[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs.
- **Assumptions:**
- **Conservative:** The platform enables at least one successful new treatment for a smaller rare disease population each year.
- **Base:** The platform facilitates several new treatments annually or one major breakthrough for a more common rare disease.
- **Optimistic:** The low-cost model spurs a wave of innovation, leading to dozens of new therapies for rare diseases and other neglected research areas.
- **Annual QALY Estimates:**
- **Conservative:** **[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs
- **Base:** **[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs
- **Optimistic:** **[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs

### Final ROI and Net Benefit

- **Recommended ROI:** {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 (including regulatory delay elimination)
- **Conservative ROI:** {{< var dfda_roi_rd_only >}}:1 (R&D savings only, NPV-adjusted)
- **PRIMARY ROI:** {{< var treaty_complete_roi_all_benefits >}}:1 (including all core benefits: R&D savings, regulatory delay elimination, and peace dividend)
- **Central Net Benefit (10-Year, Discounted):** [~\$249 Billion](#final-roi-and-net-benefit)
- **Dominant Health Intervention:** The dFDA is cost-saving while simultaneously generating substantial health gains (QALYs), making it a dominant intervention from a health economics perspective.

### Appendix: Detailed QALY Calculation Model {#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model}

This appendix provides a transparent, component-based model for the aggregate QALY figures used in this analysis. The total QALY gain is the sum of three distinct benefit streams. For each stream, you define parameters for a **Conservative**, **Base**, and **Optimistic** scenario, with sources and rationale provided for each parameter.

#### A. QALYs from Faster Drug Access

This stream models the benefit of accelerating the approval of new drugs that would likely be developed under the current paradigm, but more slowly.

- **Parameters:**
  - $N_{\text{drugs}}$: Number of new drugs approved annually whose development is accelerated.
    - **Rationale:** The FDA approves a significant number of new drugs each year, and the dFDA Infrastructure is expected to accelerate the development of a meaningful fraction of these.
    - **Source:** The FDA consistently approves a substantial number of novel therapies. For example, [in 2023, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) approved 55 novel drugs](../references.qmd#friends-cancer-research-fda-approvals).
  - $T_{\text{accel}}$: Average years of acceleration per drug.
    - **Rationale:** The dFDA model, inspired by hyper-efficient trials like the [RECOVERY trial](recovery-trial.qmd), can drastically cut development timelines from years to months.
    - **Source:** The [RECOVERY trial](recovery-trial.qmd) demonstrated uncommon speed in generating clinical results.
    - **Quote:** "Days to First Major Result: <100" ,  [The Conversation, via dFDA Wiki](recovery-trial.qmd)
  - $\text{QALYs}_{\text{drug}}$: Average QALYs gained per drug, per year of earlier access.
    - **Rationale:** Accelerating access to effective drugs has a direct and significant impact on life-years and quality of life.

- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{QALYs}_A = N_{\text{drugs}} \times T_{\text{accel}} \times \text{QALYs}_{\text{drug}}
  $$

- **Scenario Values:**
  - **Conservative:** 15 drugs/year $\times$ 1 year acceleration $\times$ 6,000 QALYs/drug = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">****[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs**</a>
  - **Base:** 20 drugs/year $\times$ 1.5 years acceleration $\times$ 6,667 QALYs/drug = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">****[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs**</a>
  - **Optimistic:** 25 drugs/year $\times$ 2 years acceleration $\times$ 10,000 QALYs/drug = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">****[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs**</a>

#### B. QALYs from Improved Prevention and Real-World Evidence (RWE)

This stream models the benefit of using the dFDA's vast data to optimize preventative care and the use of existing treatments.

- **Parameters:**
  - $P_{\text{impacted}}$: Number of patients benefiting from new preventative guidelines or RWE-driven treatment changes.
    - **Rationale:** [Chronic diseases affect a vast portion of the population](../references.qmd#us-chronic-disease-spending), and even small improvements in prevention or treatment optimization, scaled across millions of people, can generate substantial health gains.
  - $\text{QALYs}_{\text{per\_patient}}$: Average small QALY gain per impacted patient from better-targeted prevention or treatment.
    - **Rationale:** While the per-person gain from preventative measures may be small in a single year, they are well-established. The value comes from applying these small gains to a very large population. For example, [statin treatment provides a gain of 0.20 QALYs](../references.qmd#qaly-delayed-access-cost) in men aged 60 years.

- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{QALYs}_B = P_{\text{impacted}} \times \text{QALYs}_{\text{per\_patient}}
  $$

- **Scenario Values:**
  - **Conservative:** 5 million patients $\times$ 0.01 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">****[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs**</a>
  - **Base:** 14 million patients $\times$ 0.01 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">****[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs**</a>
  - **Optimistic:** 15 million patients $\times$ 0.01 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">****[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs**</a>

#### C. QALYs from Expanded Scope (New Therapies)

This stream models the benefit of enabling trials for therapies that are currently neglected due to high cost (e.g., rare diseases, unpatentable treatments, novel nutraceuticals). The model is based on the number of new therapies, the average patient population per therapy, and the QALY gain per patient.

- **Parameters:**
  - $N_{\text{new\_therapies}}$: Number of entirely new, effective therapies enabled per year for untreated conditions.
    - **Rationale:** There is a vast unmet need in the rare disease space, with only about 5% of the nearly 10,000identified rare diseases having FDA-approved treatments. Lowering trial costs via the dFDA Infrastructure would catalyze R&D for this underserved population.
  - $P_{\text{therapy}}$: Average number of patients benefiting from a new rare disease therapy.
    - **Rationale:** While "rare" in the US means affecting fewer than **[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} people, the median prevalence is much lower. This estimate uses a conservative figure for the addressable population for a new, breakthrough therapy. [Analysis of Orphanet data](../references.qmd#rare-disease-prevalence-400m) suggests a median prevalence of 1-5 per 100,000 people.
  - $\text{QALYs}_{\text{patient}}$: Average QALY gain per patient receiving a transformative therapy.
    - **Rationale:** A new therapy for a previously untreatable, life-threatening condition can have a profound impact, corresponding to many years of high-quality life.
    - **Source:** Therapies for diseases like spinal muscular atrophy or certain inherited retinal diseases can be considered near-curative, generating dozens of QALYs per patient over a lifetime.

- **Formula:**

  $$
  \text{QALYs}_C = N_{\text{new\_therapies}} \times P_{\text{therapy}} \times \text{QALYs}_{\text{patient}}
  $$

- **Scenario Values:**
  - **Conservative:** 5 new therapies/year $\times$ 2,000 patients/therapy $\times$ 5 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">**50,000 QALYs**</a>
  - **Base:** 10 new therapies/year $\times$ 5,000 patients/therapy $\times$ 10 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">****[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs**</a>
  - **Optimistic:** 20 new therapies/year $\times$ 10,000 patients/therapy $\times$ 15 QALYs/patient = <a href="#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains">****[Primary QALY estimate used]**{{< var dfda_qalys_rd_plus_delay_annual >}} QALYs**</a>

#### Summary of Total Annual QALY Gains {#summary-of-total-annual-qaly-gains}

This table summarizes the component calculations and derives the total QALY range used in the main analysis. The final totals are hyperlinked back to the [main body of the analysis](#parameterization-overall-dfda-platform-impact). The model demonstrates that even with conservative, evidence-based inputs, the potential health benefit is substantial, providing a strong rationale for the dFDA initiative.
