## The Core Strategy: Rails, Not Trains

Here's what NOT to do: Spend $500M building a government platform that competes with Epic, Cerner, Medable, and Science 37.

Here's what TO do: Spend $40-75M building an open protocol that makes all existing platforms interoperable.

**Think HTTP, not Facebook.** We're establishing the protocol layer, not building consumer applications.

## Why Partnerships Beat Build-From-Scratch

### Already-Invested Infrastructure ($1B+)

Companies have already spent over $1 billion building the pieces we need:

**Decentralized Clinical Trial Platforms**:
- [Medable](../references.qmd#dct-platform-funding-medable): $521M raised, $2.1B valuation, 60+ countries
- [Science 37](../references.qmd#dct-platform-funding-others): ~$100M raised, proven trial operations
- Thread, uMotif, others: $100M+ combined

**Electronic Health Record Vendors**:
- Epic Systems: 31% of US hospital market, billions in infrastructure
- Cerner/Oracle Health: 26% of US hospital market
- Combined: 250M+ patient records

**Consumer Health Platforms**:
- Apple Health: Billions of iOS devices collecting health data
- Google Health: Android ecosystem, health APIs

**International Infrastructure**:
- NHS/UK: Proven with [RECOVERY trial](recovery-trial.qmd) (49,000 patients, $500/patient)
- NIH All of Us: 400,000+ participants, genomic + EHR data

### Cost Comparison

| Approach | Upfront Cost | Annual Cost | Risk Level |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Build Everything** | $500M+ | $50M+ | Extreme (compete with entrenched players) |
| **Protocol + Partnerships** | $40-75M | $5-12M | Low (partners want this) |
| **Savings** | **85%** | **85%** | **De-risked** |

## The Three-Tier Partnership Model

### Tier 1: Foundational Partners (Must-Have, Year 0-1)

**Goal**: Get protocol adopted by market-dominant platforms before launch

#### Epic Systems + Cerner/Oracle Health
- **Why**: Control 57% of US hospital EHR market = 250M+ patient records
- **What they get**:
  - Reduced Meaningful Use certification fees
  - Public "Data Portability Seal of Approval"
  - Patient pressure (data portability rights)
  - Eventually: Regulatory requirement for interoperability
- **What we need**: HL7 FHIR R5 API implementation, patient-initiated data export
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months for pilot integration
- **Budget**: $10-20M integration fund

- **What they get**:
  - Health data finally matters (drives device sales)
  - "Health partner" branding (competitive advantage)
  - Integration with clinical evidence (valuable for users)
- **What we need**: Health app APIs, data export to dFDA protocol
- **Timeline**: 12-18 months
- **Budget**: $5-10M integration support

#### Major Pharmacy Chains (CVS, Walgreens, Amazon Pharmacy)
- **Why**: Physical distribution, primary care entry, patient relationships
- **What they get**:
  - Trial enrollment sites (foot traffic)
  - Differentiation from competitors
  - Data on medication effectiveness
- **What we need**: Pharmacy-based trial enrollment, medication dispensing
- **Timeline**: 12-24 months
- **Budget**: Revenue sharing model

#### NIH All of Us Research Program

- **What they get**: Expanded analysis capabilities, trial matching for participants
- **Timeline**: 6-12 months
- **Budget**: Minimal (mutual benefit)

### Tier 3: Global Expansion (Year 2-5)

#### China National Health Data Platform
- **Why**: 39% of global clinical trials run in China
- **What they get**: Access to global evidence, international credibility
- **Challenges**: Data sovereignty, IP protection, political considerations
- **Timeline**: 24-36 months
- **Budget**: $20-30M (diplomatic + technical)

#### Major Insurers (UnitedHealth, Anthem, Aetna)
- **Why**: Claims data (real-world costs), cost reduction incentive
- **What they get**: Lower drug prices (reduced trial costs), better treatment data
- **Timeline**: 12-24 months
- **Budget**: Revenue neutral (they save more than they spend)

#### European EHR Vendors
- **Why**: GDPR compliance expertise, cross-border experience
- **Timeline**: 18-30 months
- **Budget**: $10-15M

## Technical Integration Approach

### Federated, Not Centralized

**Key principle**: Data stays in source systems, only queries move.

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│ Epic System │     │ Apple Health│     │  Medable    │
│   (200M+    │     │ (billions   │     │   (DCT      │
│  records)   │     │  devices)   │     │  Platform)  │
└──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘     └──────┬──────┘
       │                   │                   │
       │ Queries only      │ Queries only      │ Queries only
       │ (no data export)  │ (no data export)  │ (no data export)

                    │  (Queries + │
                    │  Aggregated │
                    │  Results)   │
                    └─────────────┘
```

### Benefits of Federated Model

**Privacy**: Data never leaves source (GDPR/HIPAA compliant)

**Vendor Cooperation**: Epic/Cerner keep control of their data

**Patient Trust**: No central honeypot to hack

**Existing Example**: [TriNetX](../references.qmd#trinetx-federated-network) already does this with 300M+ patient records

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 0: Industry Partnership Formation (Months 0-6)

- [ ] Form Integration Consortium advisory board
- [ ] Sign partnership MOUs with Epic, Cerner, Medable, Science 37
- [ ] Establish "Founding Partner" governance structure
- [ ] Negotiate data sharing agreements

**Budget**: $5M (legal, coordination, partnership incentives)

### Phase 1: Protocol Specification (Months 6-12)

- [ ] Publish open protocol specification (HL7 FHIR R5 compliant)
- [ ] Release reference implementation (open source, GPL v3)
- [ ] Establish technical steering committee
- [ ] Begin pilot integrations with 2-3 partners

**Budget**: $15-20M (engineering, specification, pilots)

### Phase 2: Pilot Deployments (Months 12-24)

- [ ] Epic pilot: 5 hospital systems
- [ ] Medable pilot: 10 trials
- [ ] Apple Health pilot: Research app integration
- [ ] NHS partnership: RECOVERY model expansion

**Budget**: $20-30M (integration support, pilots, adjustments)

### Phase 3: Scale & Global Expansion (Months 24-36)

- [ ] 50+ hospital systems integrated
- [ ] 100+ trials running on protocol
- [ ] Consumer app ecosystem launched
- [ ] International partnerships (China, EU)

**Budget**: $20-30M (scaling, global expansion)

## Risk Mitigation

### "What if Epic/Cerner refuse to cooperate?"

**Plan A**: Patient data portability rights (legislative requirement)

**Plan B**: Start with willing vendors (smaller EHRs, Apple/Google)

**Plan C**: Public pressure campaign ("Your EHR vendor is blocking your access to trials")

### "What if Medable sees us as competition?"

**Response**: Make them Founding Partners with:
- Governance seats
- Revenue sharing
- "Powered by dFDA Protocol" branding
- Early access to features

They benefit more from cooperation than competition.

### "What if regulatory approval takes too long?"

**Response**:
- Start with international partners (NHS already doing this)
- Use Other Transaction Authority (NIH can bypass normal procurement)
- Public pressure on FDA to enable protocol

## Success Metrics
