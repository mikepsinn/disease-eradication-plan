"Getting 195 countries to agree costs billions and takes forever."

No. Getting countries to *implement* things costs billions. Getting them to *sign papers* is surprisingly cheap. Humans love signing papers. It makes them feel important.

## What Treaties Actually Cost

NGO campaign budgets are rarely disclosed publicly, but we know enough about organizational structure and government funding to establish that treaty campaigns operate on remarkably modest resources:

| Treaty | Timeline | Campaign Structure | Government Support | Outcome |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Ottawa Treaty](../references.qmd#icbl-ottawa-treaty) (Landmines, 1997)** | 14 months (Oct '96 - Dec '97) | [ICBL](../references.qmd#icbl-ottawa-treaty): Started with **1 staff member** (Jody Williams), grew to 1,000+ orgs in 60 countries | Canada: $100M CAD Landmine Fund over 10 years; International donors: $169M in 1997 for mine action | 122 states signed; Nobel Peace Prize 1997 |
| **[Cluster Munitions](../references.qmd#cluster-munitions-convention-2008) (2008)** | ~2 years (Feb '07 - Dec '08) | [CMC Coalition](../references.qmd#cluster-munitions-convention-2008) of NGOs; Core Group of 7 governments | Norway: Funded UNIDIR research project 2004-2008; hosted Oslo conferences | 94 states signed; 1.4M stockpiled munitions destroyed |
| **[Arms Trade Treaty](../references.qmd#arms-trade-treaty-2013) (2013)** | 10 years (2003-2013) | [Control Arms](../references.qmd#control-arms-coalition): 100+ organizations (Oxfam, Amnesty); published 50+ reports | UK, Australia led diplomatic process; UN conferences | Started with 3 supporting govts → 130 signatories |
| **[Nuclear Ban](../references.qmd#ican-nuclear-ban-treaty) (TPNW, 2017)** | 10 years (2007-2017) | [ICAN](../references.qmd#ican-nuclear-ban-treaty): **5 staff** (3 full-time + 2 part-time) in Geneva coordinating 468 partner orgs | Norwegian govt grant funded Geneva office (2011); Austria hosted conferences | 122 states voted yes; Nobel Peace Prize 2017 |

**Pattern**: These campaigns succeed with **tiny staff** (1-5 people) coordinating large coalitions. The NGO campaign costs are minimal - a few million dollars per year at most. Government support for conferences and delegate travel adds another $10-30M. Total "getting the treaty signed" costs: **$15-50M over the campaign period**.

### Inflation-Adjusted to 2024 Dollars

Using [BLS CPI data](https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm):

| Treaty (Year) | Original Cost Estimate | 2024 Dollars | Inflation Multiplier |
|:--------------|:----------------------|:-------------|:---------------------|
| Ottawa (1997) | $15-25M | **$30-50M** | ~2.0x |
| Cluster Munitions (2008) | $15-25M | **$23-38M** | ~1.5x |
| Arms Trade Treaty (2013) | $20-30M | **$27-41M** | ~1.35x |
| Nuclear Ban (2017) | $10-20M | **$13-25M** | ~1.25x |

**In today's money**: Treaty campaigns cost roughly **$25-50M** (2024 USD) for the "getting it signed" phase.

That's **less than 0.2%** of the implementation cost. Banning landmines: ~$40M in campaigning and diplomacy (2024 dollars), [$5B+ to actually remove them](../references.qmd#icbl-ottawa-treaty). The signing part is the cheap part.

## Cost for a 1% Health Treaty

This one touches military budgets - the sacred cow of national sovereignty. Governments get nervous when you suggest moving their explosion money. So budget 3-4× what landmines cost.

| Phase | Duration | Estimated Cost | Who Pays |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Pre-negotiations**<br>(Coalition building, expert drafts) | 18–24 months | **$8–12M** | Philanthropy (Gates, Open Philanthropy, etc.) + Champion Governments |
| **2. Global Campaign**<br>(Platform, 3.5% consent, media) | 3–5 years | **$45–80M** | Philanthropy + Crowd-funding |
| **3. Diplomatic Process**<br>(Conferences, delegate travel) | 18–30 months | **$15–25M** | Host Governments + UN Trust Fund |
| **4. Ratification Drive**<br>(Legal reviews, parliamentary aid) | 2–4 years | **$5–8M** | Philanthropy |
| **5. Contingency**<br>(Opposition management) | Ongoing | **$10–15M** | Strategic Comms / Lobbying |

**Total: $90–140 Million**

### The Math

Signing the treaty: ~$90M.
What the treaty unlocks: $27 Billion/year. Forever.

The diplomatic process costs ~0.3% of a single year's funding. Three days of the future annual flow. You're buying a $27B/year annuity for $90M. That's a 300:1 return on paperwork.

## How to Make Governments Sign Things

Politicians move when they see (a) voters demanding it and (b) political safety. Give them both:

1. **Prove public demand**: Get [3.5% of the population](../references.qmd#3-5-rule) (280M people) to say "yes" with verified identity. Harvard researcher Erica Chenoweth found that [every nonviolent campaign](../references.qmd#3-5-rule) with 3.5%+ participation succeeded. That's not activism - that's a mandate. Hard to ignore 280 million verified humans.
2. **Prove it's safe**: Peer-reviewed modeling showing every nation gains more in health savings than it loses in military spending. Politicians need cover. Give them studies to wave around.

### Timeline to "Governments Can't Ignore This"

With ~$60M in seed funding, we can reach "Treaty-Ready" status in **2–3 years**:

- **Platform:** 280M verified supporters (3.5% threshold)
- **Modeling:** Country-by-country impact analysis
- **Coalition:** 120+ supportive NGOs and 5-10 champion governments

Once these assets exist, formal negotiations become inevitable.

## Conclusion

We aren't trying to buy the treaty. We are buying the **machinery** that makes the treaty inevitable. And that machinery costs about $90M, a rounding error compared to the $140 Trillion/year problem we are solving.

## Political Success Probability: Economic Analysis {#sec-political-success-probability}

For expected value calculations, we need to estimate the probability that a 1% treaty campaign actually succeeds. This section documents the rationale for our **{{< var political_success_probability >}} central estimate** with a **0.1%-25% confidence interval**.

**Key insight**: Even at {{< var political_success_probability >}} probability of success, this intervention's expected cost per DALY ({{< var treaty_expected_cost_per_daly >}}) is still **{{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x more cost-effective** than malaria bed nets ({{< var bed_nets_cost_per_daly >}}/DALY), the gold standard of global health interventions.

### Historical Precedents for International Financial Commitments

| Commitment | Target | Actual Compliance | Duration | Notes |
|:-----------|:-------|:------------------|:---------|:------|
| **0.7% ODA Target** | 0.7% of GNI to foreign aid | 5-6 of ~30 DAC countries (~20%) | 50+ years | Only Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Germany consistently meet it |
| **Kyoto Protocol** | Binding emissions targets | ~55% coverage initially | 1997-2012 | US never ratified, Canada withdrew, many missed targets |
| **Paris Agreement NDCs** | Non-binding pledges | ~15-25% on track | 2015-present | High adoption (195 countries) but low compliance |
| **NATO 2% GDP Defense** | 2% of GDP on defense | ~10 of 31 members (~32%) | Since 2014 | Even with security pressure, most miss target |
| **EU Stability Pact** | 3% deficit, 60% debt | Routinely violated | Since 1997 | France, Germany themselves violated it |

**Pattern**: Binding international financial commitments requiring ongoing budget reallocation achieve **<25% meaningful compliance**, even with strong institutional pressure.

### Why a 1% Treaty is Harder Than Most Precedents

1. **Touches military budgets**: The most politically sensitive area of national sovereignty
2. **Requires ongoing annual allocation**: Not a one-time action like banning a weapon
3. **No immediate security threat**: Unlike NATO spending increases post-Ukraine
4. **Novel mechanism**: Military→health reallocation is unprecedented
5. **Coordination problem**: Benefits require critical mass of participants

### Why a 1% Treaty Might Beat the Odds

1. **Self-funding mechanism**: Creates health dividends that exceed the "cost"
2. **Bipartisan appeal**: Health spending polls better than military across political spectrum
3. **Referendum pathway**: Can bypass government resistance through direct democracy
4. **Visible beneficiaries**: 150,000 daily disease deaths creates moral urgency
5. **Network effects**: Each signing country makes the next more likely

### Probability Estimates

Based on this analysis, economists would find the following defensible:

| Scenario | Probability | Rationale |
|:---------|:------------|:----------|
| **Pessimistic floor** | 0.1% | Near-impossible - complete political gridlock, competing global crises |
| **Conservative central** | {{< var political_success_probability >}} | Assumes 99% failure rate - yet still {{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x better than bed nets |
| **Optimistic ceiling** | 25% | Major crisis creates political window; unique self-funding advantage |

**Our model uses**: Central estimate **{{< var political_success_probability >}}**, 95% CI **[0.1%, 25%]**

This is deliberately ultra-conservative. An economist reviewing our expected value calculations should find:

- The {{< var political_success_probability >}} central estimate assumes a **99% chance of complete failure**
- The 0.1% floor admits this could be nearly impossible
- Even at {{< var political_success_probability >}}, expected cost/DALY ({{< var treaty_expected_cost_per_daly >}}) beats bed nets ({{< var bed_nets_cost_per_daly >}}) by {{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x
- The 25% ceiling reflects that partial success or crisis-driven adoption is possible

### Expected Value Implications

At {{< var political_success_probability >}} probability of success:

- **Expected ROI**: {{< var dfda_expected_roi >}}:1 (still positive)
- **Expected cost per DALY**: {{< var treaty_expected_cost_per_daly >}} (still {{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x better than bed nets)

The intervention remains economically justified even assuming a 99% chance of failure because:
1. The conditional benefits ({{< var treaty_roi_lag_elimination >}}:1 ROI if successful) are enormous
2. Even the expected value at {{< var political_success_probability >}} success beats the best alternative by {{< var treaty_expected_vs_bed_nets_multiplier >}}x
3. The downside is capped at campaign cost (~$1B), while upside is unbounded

## Why The Treaty Won't Stop at 1%

Most international commitments stagnate after initial signing. The table above shows 0.7% ODA targets unmet for 50+ years, Kyoto Protocol abandoned, Paris Agreement goals missed. Why expect different from a 1% health treaty?

**Because we've built a scaling engine into the mechanism.**

The [80/10/10 funding structure](../solution/incentive-alignment-bonds.qmd) allocates {{< var iab_political_incentive_funding_pct >}}% of treaty funding ($2.7B/year at 1%) to [Incentive Alignment Bonds](../solution/incentive-alignment-bonds.qmd) - securities that pay out when treaties *expand*, not just maintain.

### The Expansion Mechanism

| Treaty Level | Annual IAB Pool | Political Pressure | Historical Comparison |
|:-------------|:----------------|:-------------------|:---------------------|
| 1% | $2.7B/year | Strong | 10× largest NGO budgets |
| 2% | $5.4B/year | Very strong | Nation-state level |
| 5% | $13.5B/year | Overwhelming | Major industry lobby |
| 10% | $27B/year | Unstoppable | No precedent |

### Why This Differs from Stagnant Treaties

**0.7% ODA failed** because there was no financial mechanism incentivizing expansion. The NGOs pushing for compliance have small budgets and compete with each other.

**The 1% health treaty creates its own expansion lobby** - bond holders who profit when the treaty expands to 2%, then 5%, then 10%. These aren't activists who can be ignored. They're investors with returns tied to treaty growth.

### The Ratchet Effect

Once 1% passes:
1. **$2.7B/year** flows to IAB holders pushing for 2%
2. When 2% passes → **$5.4B/year** pushing for 5%  
3. When 5% passes → **$13.5B/year** pushing for 10%
4. The political pressure for expansion *accelerates* with each success

This is the opposite of typical treaties where political momentum fades after signing. The IAB mechanism ensures that the constituency for expansion *grows* rather than shrinks over time.

### Long-Term Feasibility

The $90M campaign gets the 1% treaty signed. But the real question isn't "Can we get 1%?" - it's "Can we eventually redirect most military spending to health?"

With IABs: Yes. The 10% allocation creates a perpetual political engine that makes expansion inevitable once the initial treaty passes. Each percentage point adds more fuel to the engine.

Without IABs: Probably not. We'd join the long list of international commitments that achieved initial success but stagnated because there was no mechanism to sustain political pressure for expansion.

**The $90M buys more than a 1% treaty - it buys the seed of a scaling mechanism that can eventually unlock $2.7 trillion/year.**
