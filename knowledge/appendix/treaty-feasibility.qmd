"Getting 195 countries to agree costs billions and takes forever."

No. Getting countries to *implement* things costs billions. Getting them to *sign papers* is surprisingly cheap. Humans love signing papers. It makes them feel important.

## What Treaties Actually Cost

Here's what previous "getting countries to sign a piece of paper" campaigns actually spent:

| Treaty | Time to Entry-Into-Force | Direct Campaign Cost | Who Paid | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ottawa Treaty (Landmines, 1997)** | ~2.5 years | **≈ $12–18M** | Canada, Norway, ICBL NGO | ICBL campaign budget was only ~$5–7M total. Canada spent ~$10–15M on the diplomatic process. |
| **Cluster Munitions (2008)** | ~2.5 years | **≈ $10–15M** | Norway, CMC Coalition | Norway spent ~$12–15M on the Oslo Process. |
| **Arms Trade Treaty (2013)** | ~5 years | **≈ $20–25M** | UK, Australia, NGOs | Longer and more contested, so slightly more expensive. |
| **Nuclear Ban (TPNW, 2017)** | ~4 years | **≈ $8–12M** | ICAN Campaign, Austria | ICAN's budget was ~$10M; governments paid for UN conferences. |

**Pattern**: $10–25 million (in 1990s/2000s dollars, ~$20-40M today) covers diplomatic conferences, flying poor-country delegates to Geneva, and global NGO campaigns. That's **less than 0.2%** of the implementation cost.

Banning landmines: $15M in paperwork, $5B+ to actually remove them. The signing part is the cheap part.

## Cost for a 1% Health Treaty

This one touches military budgets - the sacred cow of national sovereignty. Governments get nervous when you suggest moving their explosion money. So budget 3-4× what landmines cost.

| Phase | Duration | Estimated Cost | Who Pays |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Pre-negotiations**<br>(Coalition building, expert drafts) | 18–24 months | **$8–12M** | Philanthropy (Gates, Open Philanthropy, etc.) + Champion Governments |
| **2. Global Campaign**<br>(Platform, 3.5% consent, media) | 3–5 years | **$45–80M** | Philanthropy + Crowd-funding |
| **3. Diplomatic Process**<br>(Conferences, delegate travel) | 18–30 months | **$15–25M** | Host Governments + UN Trust Fund |
| **4. Ratification Drive**<br>(Legal reviews, parliamentary aid) | 2–4 years | **$5–8M** | Philanthropy |
| **5. Contingency**<br>(Opposition management) | Ongoing | **$10–15M** | Strategic Comms / Lobbying |

**Total: $90–140 Million**

### The Math

Signing the treaty: ~$90M.
What the treaty unlocks: $27 Billion/year. Forever.

The diplomatic process costs ~0.3% of a single year's funding. Three days of the future annual flow. You're buying a $27B/year annuity for $90M. That's a 300:1 return on paperwork.

## How to Make Governments Sign Things

Politicians move when they see (a) voters demanding it and (b) political safety. Give them both:

1. **Prove public demand**: Get 3.5% of the population (280M people) to say "yes" with verified identity. That's not activism - that's a mandate. Hard to ignore 280 million verified humans.
2. **Prove it's safe**: Peer-reviewed modeling showing every nation gains more in health savings than it loses in military spending. Politicians need cover. Give them studies to wave around.

### Timeline to "Governments Can't Ignore This"

With ~$60M in seed funding, we can reach "Treaty-Ready" status in **2–3 years**:
- **Platform:** 280M verified supporters (3.5% threshold)
- **Modeling:** Country-by-country impact analysis
- **Coalition:** 120+ supportive NGOs and 5-10 champion governments

Once these assets exist, formal negotiations become inevitable.

## Conclusion

We aren't trying to buy the treaty. We are buying the **machinery** that makes the treaty inevitable. And that machinery costs about $90M, a rounding error compared to the $140 Trillion/year problem we are solving.

## Political Success Probability: Economic Analysis {#sec-political-success-probability}

For expected value calculations, we need to estimate the probability that a 1% treaty campaign actually succeeds. This section documents the rationale for our **1% central estimate** with a **0.1%-25% confidence interval**.

**Key insight**: Even at 1% probability of success, this intervention's expected cost per DALY (~$7) is still **7x more cost-effective** than malaria bed nets (~$50/DALY), the gold standard of global health interventions.

### Historical Precedents for International Financial Commitments

| Commitment | Target | Actual Compliance | Duration | Notes |
|:-----------|:-------|:------------------|:---------|:------|
| **0.7% ODA Target** | 0.7% of GNI to foreign aid | 5-6 of ~30 DAC countries (~20%) | 50+ years | Only Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Germany consistently meet it |
| **Kyoto Protocol** | Binding emissions targets | ~55% coverage initially | 1997-2012 | US never ratified, Canada withdrew, many missed targets |
| **Paris Agreement NDCs** | Non-binding pledges | ~15-25% on track | 2015-present | High adoption (195 countries) but low compliance |
| **NATO 2% GDP Defense** | 2% of GDP on defense | ~10 of 31 members (~32%) | Since 2014 | Even with security pressure, most miss target |
| **EU Stability Pact** | 3% deficit, 60% debt | Routinely violated | Since 1997 | France, Germany themselves violated it |

**Pattern**: Binding international financial commitments requiring ongoing budget reallocation achieve **<25% meaningful compliance**, even with strong institutional pressure.

### Why a 1% Treaty is Harder Than Most Precedents

1. **Touches military budgets**: The most politically sensitive area of national sovereignty
2. **Requires ongoing annual allocation**: Not a one-time action like banning a weapon
3. **No immediate security threat**: Unlike NATO spending increases post-Ukraine
4. **Novel mechanism**: Military→health reallocation is unprecedented
5. **Coordination problem**: Benefits require critical mass of participants

### Why a 1% Treaty Might Beat the Odds

1. **Self-funding mechanism**: Creates health dividends that exceed the "cost"
2. **Bipartisan appeal**: Health spending polls better than military across political spectrum
3. **Referendum pathway**: Can bypass government resistance through direct democracy
4. **Visible beneficiaries**: 150,000 daily disease deaths creates moral urgency
5. **Network effects**: Each signing country makes the next more likely

### Probability Estimates

Based on this analysis, economists would find the following defensible:

| Scenario | Probability | Rationale |
|:---------|:------------|:----------|
| **Pessimistic floor** | 0.1% | Near-impossible - complete political gridlock, competing global crises |
| **Conservative central** | 1% | Assumes 99% failure rate - yet still 7x better than bed nets |
| **Optimistic ceiling** | 25% | Major crisis creates political window; unique self-funding advantage |

**Our model uses**: Central estimate **1%**, 95% CI **[0.1%, 25%]**

This is deliberately ultra-conservative. An economist reviewing our expected value calculations should find:
- The 1% central estimate assumes a **99% chance of complete failure**
- The 0.1% floor admits this could be nearly impossible
- Even at 1%, expected cost/DALY (~$7) beats bed nets (~$50) by 7x
- The 25% ceiling reflects that partial success or crisis-driven adoption is possible

### Expected Value Implications

At 1% probability of success:
- **Expected ROI**: {{< var dfda_expected_roi >}}:1 (still positive)
- **Expected cost per DALY**: {{< var treaty_expected_cost_per_daly >}} (still 7x better than bed nets)

The intervention remains economically justified even assuming a 99% chance of failure because:
1. The conditional benefits ({{< var treaty_roi_lag_elimination >}}:1 ROI if successful) are enormous
2. Even the expected value at 1% success beats the best alternative by 7x
3. The downside is capped at campaign cost (~$1B), while upside is unbounded
