**Bottom Line**: The 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA Infrastructure is a **dominant health intervention** that saves society **$6.17M** per life saved (ICER = **$-176,382** per QALY).

This means for every life saved, society becomes **$6.17M** richer instead of paying the [$3,500 cost of top charitable interventions](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved).

**How is this possible?** This initiative generates massive economic value ({{< var treaty_total_annual_benefits >}} annually) while also saving lives ({{< var treaty_total_qalys_gained_annual >}} QALYs annually), making it profitable for society to implement.

## Complete Calculation Walkthrough

### Step 1: Annual Economic Benefits

#### 1a. Peace Dividend ({{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}}/year)

**Quick summary**: The 1% Treaty reduces global conflict by 1%, saving society {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} annually from reduced military spending, infrastructure destruction, healthcare costs, and economic disruption.

**Calculation**: $11.4T total war costs × 1.0% reduction = **113.6B**

**For detailed breakdown and methodology**, see:

- [Peace Dividend Chapter](../economics/peace-dividend.qmd) - Accessible overview with breakdown table
- [Cost of War Analysis](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd) - Source data

#### 1b. Health Dividend ({{< var dfda_gross_savings_annual >}}/year)

**Quick summary**: The dFDA (Decentralized FDA) makes clinical trials 82× cheaper by using the Oxford RECOVERY model, saving {{< var dfda_gross_savings_annual >}} annually from the {{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual >}} global trial market.

**Calculation**: {{< var global_clinical_trials_spending_annual >}} trial market × 50.0% cost reduction = **{{< var dfda_gross_savings_annual >}}**

**ROI**: 463:1 return on {{< var dfda_upfront_build_billions >}} annual operational cost

**For detailed breakdown and methodology**, see:

- [Health Dividend Chapter](../economics/health-dividend.qmd) - Accessible overview with cost breakdown
- [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) - Detailed mechanism and QALY model

#### Total Annual Economic Benefits

**{{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} + {{< var dfda_gross_savings_annual >}} = {{< var treaty_total_annual_benefits >}} per year**

**Sensitivity range**: $139B to $209B (conservative to optimistic scenarios)

### Step 2: Annual Health Benefits (QALYs)

#### 2a. Peace Dividend Health Benefits ({{< var treaty_qalys_gained_annual_global >}} QALYs/year)

**Source**: [Cost of War Analysis](../problem/cost-of-war.qmd#death-accounting)

**Annual conflict deaths**: {{< var global_annual_conflict_deaths_total >}} people/year

- Active combat: {{< var global_annual_conflict_deaths_active_combat >}} ([ACLED data](https://acleddata.com/))
- Terror attacks: {{< var global_annual_conflict_deaths_terror_attacks >}} ([Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/))
- State violence: {{< var global_annual_conflict_deaths_state_violence >}} ([Uppsala Conflict Data Program](https://ucdp.uu.se/))

**1.0% reduction in conflict**:

- Lives saved: {{< var global_annual_conflict_deaths_total >}} × 0.01 = **{{< var treaty_lives_saved_annual_global >}} lives/year**

**Converting to QALYs**:

- Standard assumption: 1 life saved = 35 QALYs ([WHO life tables](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates/ghe-life-expectancy-and-healthy-life-expectancy))
- Rationale: Average age of conflict death ~30 years, life expectancy ~65 years = 35 years of life
- QALYs from peace dividend: {{< var treaty_lives_saved_annual_global >}} × 35 = **{{< var treaty_qalys_gained_annual_global >}} QALYs/year**

**Sensitivity range**: 500-1,500 lives saved = {{< var sensitivity_peace_qalys_conservative >}}-{{< var sensitivity_peace_qalys_optimistic >}} QALYs

#### 2b. dFDA Health Benefits ({{< var global_dfda_qalys_gained_annual >}} QALYs/year)

**Source**: [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model)

**Baseline projection**: {{< var global_dfda_qalys_gained_annual >}} QALYs/year from:

1. **Faster drug access** (24% of total): 24% QALYs
   - Average 2-3 year reduction in time to market
   - Applied to ~{{< var current_drug_approvals_per_year >}} new drugs/year reaching market faster

2. **New therapies enabled** (60% of total): 60% QALYs
   - Rare diseases now economically viable
   - Unpatentable treatments tested
   - Repurposed drugs

3. **Prevention via real-world data** (17% of total): 17% QALYs
   - Early detection of drug interactions
   - Personalized medicine insights
   - Population health monitoring

**Sensitivity range**: {{< var qalys_total_conservative >}} (conservative) to {{< var qalys_total_optimistic >}} (optimistic) QALYs

See [Appendix: Detailed QALY Calculation Model](dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model) for complete methodology.

#### Total Annual Health Benefits

**{{< var treaty_qalys_gained_annual_global >}} + {{< var global_dfda_qalys_gained_annual >}} = {{< var treaty_total_qalys_gained_annual >}} QALYs/year**

**Sensitivity range**: 437,500 (low) to 2,152,500 (high) QALYs

### Step 3: Annual Costs

#### 3a. Campaign Costs ({{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} over 4 years, amortized)

**Source**: [Campaign Budget](../economics/campaign-budget.qmd)

**Total campaign budget**: {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} over 4 years

- Global Referendum (viral system, platform, verification): {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_referendum >}}
- Political Lobbying (US/EU/G20, Super PACs, legal, opposition research): {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}}
- Reserve Fund (post-victory transition, contingency): {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_reserve >}}

**Amortized annual cost**:

- Conservative (3 years): {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} ÷ 3 = {{< var sensitivity_campaign_cost_conservative_billions >}}/year
- Central (4 years): {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} ÷ 4 = **$250M/year**
- Optimistic (5 years): {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} ÷ 5 = {{< var sensitivity_campaign_cost_optimistic_billions >}}/year

**Using central estimate**: **$250M/year**

**Note**: After initial 3-5 year campaign, these costs drop to near zero. You use amortized costs for a 10-year NPV analysis.

#### 3b. dFDA Operational Costs ({{< var dfda_upfront_build_billions >}}/year)

**Source**: [dFDA Cost-Benefit Analysis](dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#simplified-roi-scenario)

**Annual operational costs**: {{< var dfda_upfront_build_billions >}}/year

- Platform maintenance: {{< var dfda_opex_platform_maintenance_billions >}}
- Staff (minimal, AI-assisted): {{< var dfda_opex_staff_billions >}}
- Infrastructure (cloud, security): {{< var dfda_opex_infrastructure_billions >}}
- Regulatory coordination: {{< var dfda_opex_regulatory_billions >}}
- Community support: {{< var dfda_opex_community_billions >}}

**Sensitivity range**: {{< var sensitivity_dfda_opex_optimistic_billions >}} (efficient) to {{< var sensitivity_dfda_opex_conservative_billions >}} (expanded operations)

#### Total Annual Costs

**Campaign (amortized) + dFDA operations = {{< var treaty_total_annual_costs >}}/year**

**Sensitivity range**: {{< var sensitivity_total_costs_optimistic_billions >}} to {{< var sensitivity_total_costs_conservative_billions >}}

### Step 3b: Alternative Cost Perspective - The Funding Mechanism

**Important Note**: The above calculation uses traditional health economics methodology, counting all upfront costs. However, the actual funding mechanism makes the true cost perspective more nuanced.

#### Understanding the Funding Flow

**The DIH Treasury Mechanism**:

1. **Countries redirect {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}/year** from military budgets to the DIH treasury
2. **The DIH treasury allocates**:
   - 2.7B/year → VICTORY bondholders (10.0% of redirected funds)
   - $24.5B/year → Medical research and operations
   - This $24.5B covers:
     - dFDA operations: {{< var dfda_upfront_build_billions >}}/year
     - Clinical trial subsidies: ~$10.0B-$20.0B/year
     - Other medical research: Remaining funds

**VICTORY Bond Financing**:

- **Investors provide**: $1.0B upfront (funds the campaign)
- **Investors receive**: 2.7B/year perpetually ({{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual return)
- **Payback period**: 4.4 months
- **Result**: Campaign is self-funding from investor perspective

#### Alternative Cost Framings

##### Framing 1: Zero Upfront Cost (Investor-Funded)

- Campaign cost: $0 (funded by VICTORY bond investors who get repaid)
- dFDA operations: $0 (funded by DIH treasury from redirected military spending)
- **Total cost to society: $0/year**
- **ICER = -$168,114 per QALY** (society pays nothing, gets everything)

**Framing 2: Opportunity Cost of Redirected Spending**

- Cost: {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}/year (redirected military spending)
- But this {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} is ALREADY COUNTED in the {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} peace dividend
- Net cost: {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} - {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} = $0
- **ICER = -$187,543 per QALY**

###### Framing 3: Military Waste Conversion

- Military spending has negative ROI (destroys value)
- Medical spending has positive ROI (creates value)
- You're converting waste into productive investment
- **True cost: Negative** (you're avoiding wasteful spending)
- **ICER = Undefined** (negative cost, positive QALYs)

#### Why We Use Conservative {{< var treaty_total_annual_costs >}}/Year in Primary Analysis

**For credibility and conservative estimation**:

1. Health economics convention requires counting all costs
2. Someone must pay the $1.0B campaign cost initially (even if repaid)
3. Conservative estimates are more defensible to skeptics
4. This intervention is dominant even with costs included

**Key insight**: Even counting ALL costs conservatively, the ICER is {{< var icer_per_qaly >}}/QALY. Under more realistic framings where the campaign is self-funding, the true societal cost approaches $0, making the intervention infinitely cost-effective.

### Step 4: ICER Calculation

**ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio)** = (Costs - Benefits) / QALYs gained

#### 4a. Net Economic Impact

**Annual net benefit** = Benefits - Costs

- Benefits: {{< var treaty_total_annual_benefits >}}
- Costs: {{< var treaty_total_annual_costs >}}
- **Net benefit: {{< var treaty_net_annual_benefit >}} per year**

**Society saves {{< var treaty_net_annual_benefit >}} while gaining {{< var treaty_total_qalys_gained_annual >}} QALYs**

#### 4b. ICER per QALY

**ICER** = ({{< var treaty_total_annual_costs >}} - {{< var treaty_total_annual_benefits >}}) / {{< var treaty_total_qalys_gained_annual >}} QALYs

**ICER** = {{< var treaty_total_annual_costs >}} / {{< var treaty_total_qalys_gained_annual >}}

##### ICER = {{< var icer_per_qaly >}} per QALY

**Interpretation**: For every QALY gained, society saves {{< var icer_per_qaly >}}. This is a **dominant intervention** (saves money AND improves health).

#### 4c. Cost per Life Saved

**Cost per life** = ICER × QALYs per life

**Cost per life** = {{< var icer_per_qaly >}} × 35 QALYs/life

**Cost per life ≈ {{< var net_benefit_per_life_saved >}} per life saved**

**Interpretation**: For every life saved, society saves approximately {{< var net_benefit_per_life_saved >}}.

## Comparison to Other Interventions

### [Top Charitable Interventions (GiveWell 2024)](../references.qmd#givewell-cost-per-life-saved)

| Intervention | Cost per Life Saved | ICER (approx) |
|-------------|--------------------:|---------------:|
| **Helen Keller International** (Vitamin A) | $3,500 | $100/QALY |
| **New Incentives** (Vaccination incentives) | $4,500 | $129/QALY |
| **Against Malaria Foundation** (bed nets) | $5,500 | $157/QALY |

**Source**: [GiveWell 2024 Top Charities](https://www.givewell.org/how-much-does-it-cost-to-save-a-life/february-2024-version)

These are **excellent** interventions - among the best uses of charitable dollars. They cost society money but save lives very cost-effectively.

### 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA

| Intervention | Cost per Life Saved | ICER |
|-------------|--------------------:|------:|
| **1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA** | **{{< var net_benefit_per_life_saved >}}** | **{{< var icer_per_qaly >}}/QALY** |

This is a **dominant intervention** - it makes society richer while saving lives.

### The Difference

**Traditional charity model**: Society pays to save lives

- Excellent value ($3,500 per life)
- Requires ongoing donations
- Costs money to implement

**1% Treaty model**: Society profits from saving lives

- Exceptional value ({{< var net_benefit_per_life_saved >}} per life = society saves money)
- Self-funding from economic gains
- Generates wealth while improving health

**The multiplier**: The 1% Treaty is **{{< var multiplier_vs_givewell >}}x more cost-effective** than the best charities in the world.

### ICER Across Scenarios

| Scenario | Net Benefit | QALYs | ICER/QALY | Cost/Life |
|----------|------------:|------:|-----------:|----------:|
| **Conservative** | {{< var sensitivity_net_benefit_conservative >}} | {{< var sensitivity_total_qalys_conservative >}} | **{{< var sensitivity_icer_conservative >}}** | **{{< var sensitivity_cost_per_life_conservative >}}** |

**Key finding**: In ALL scenarios, the intervention is dominant (saves money while saving lives).

### Alternative ICER Calculations Based on Funding Perspective

| Perspective | Annual Cost | Annual Benefit | QALYs | ICER/QALY | Cost/Life | Notes |
|-------------|------------:|---------------:|------:|----------:|----------:|-------|
| **Conservative (All Costs)** | {{< var treaty_total_annual_costs >}} | {{< var treaty_total_annual_benefits >}} | {{< var treaty_total_qalys_gained_annual >}} | **{{< var sensitivity_icer_central >}}** | **{{< var sensitivity_cost_per_life_central >}}** | Counts all upfront costs |
| **Investor-Funded** | $0 | {{< var treaty_total_annual_benefits >}} | {{< var treaty_total_qalys_gained_annual >}} | **{{< var icer_investor_funded >}}** | **{{< var cost_per_life_investor_funded >}}** | Campaign funded by VICTORY Social Impact Bonds |
| **Opportunity Cost** | {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} | {{< var treaty_total_annual_benefits >}} | {{< var treaty_total_qalys_gained_annual >}} | **{{< var icer_opportunity_cost >}}** | **{{< var cost_per_life_opportunity_cost >}}** | Counts redirected military spending |
| **Waste Conversion** | {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} | {{< var treaty_total_annual_benefits >}} | {{< var treaty_total_qalys_gained_annual >}} | **Undefined** | **Undefined** | Military spending creates negative value |

*Military spending has negative ROI (destroys value), so redirecting it is a benefit, not a cost.

**Interpretation**:

- Under traditional health economics (Conservative), the ICER is {{< var icer_per_qaly >}}/QALY
- Under realistic funding (Investor-Funded), society pays $0, ICER approaches -∞
- Considering opportunity cost of military spending, ICER is {{< var icer_opportunity_cost >}}/QALY
- Recognizing military spending as waste, the intervention has undefined (infinite) cost-effectiveness

**Worst case** (conservative): Society still saves {{< var sensitivity_cost_per_life_conservative >}} per life saved

**Best case** (optimistic): Society saves {{< var sensitivity_cost_per_life_optimistic >}} per life saved (lower because you're saving many more lives, so the economic benefit is spread across more QALYs)

## Visual Comparisons

### Cost-Effectiveness: How Much Does Society Pay to Save a Life?

{{< include ../figures/philanthropic-cost-effectiveness-comparison-bar-chart.qmd >}}

This chart demonstrates the fundamental difference between traditional philanthropy and the 1% Treaty approach:

- **GiveWell Top Charities** (Helen Keller International, New Incentives, Against Malaria Foundation): Society pays $3,500-$5,500 per life saved. These are excellent interventions, among the most cost-effective charitable uses of money in the world.

- **1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA**: Society SAVES {{< var net_benefit_per_life_saved >}} per life saved. This is a dominant intervention that generates wealth while saving lives. The stacked bar shows contributions from both the peace dividend (1% less conflict) and dFDA R&D savings.

The dramatic scale difference illustrates why this intervention is ~1,700× more cost-effective than even the best traditional charities.

### Scale of Impact: Annual Economic Benefits

{{< include ../figures/health-programs-vs-1-percent-treaty-societal-benefits-bar-chart.qmd >}}

This chart compares the gross annual economic benefits across major public health interventions:

- **Traditional interventions** (Water Fluoridation, Smoking Cessation, Childhood Vaccinations): Generate $0.8B to $15B in annual economic benefits. These are highly successful programs that have transformed public health.

- **1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA**: Generates {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} in annual economic benefits ({{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} peace dividend + {{< var dfda_gross_savings_annual >}} dFDA R&D savings). This is nearly 11× larger than childhood vaccinations, one of the most successful interventions in history.

**Key distinction**: Only the 1% Treaty is self-funding, it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself while traditional interventions require ongoing funding.

### Monte Carlo Simulation (Recommended)

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How can this save money while saving lives?

**A**: The 1% Treaty generates {{< var combined_peace_health_dividends_annual_for_roi_calc >}} in annual economic benefits:

- {{< var peace_dividend_annual_societal_benefit >}} from reduced conflict costs (peace dividend)
- {{< var dfda_gross_savings_annual >}} from more efficient medical R&D (dFDA)

These benefits far exceed the {{< var treaty_total_annual_costs >}} annual costs, creating a net profit of {{< var treaty_net_annual_benefit >}}/year for society.

Meanwhile, the same initiative saves lives:

- {{< var traditional_large_trial_size >}} lives from 1% less conflict
- {{< var global_dfda_qalys_gained_annual >}} QALYs from faster/better medical treatments

You get **both** the economic benefit **and** the health benefit.

### Q: Why isn't everyone doing this already?

**A**: Market failure and collective action problem:

- Individual countries can't capture the global benefits
- Defense contractors profit from the status quo
- No mechanism exists to coordinate global action
- Medical research funding is fragmented across countries

The 1% Treaty solves this by creating aligned incentives.

### Q: What's the catch?

**A**: The main challenges are **political, not economic**:

- Getting countries to sign the treaty (hence the $1.0B campaign)
- Overcoming defense industry opposition (hence VICTORY Social Impact Bonds to co-opt them)
- Building the dFDA infrastructure (hence the {{< var dfda_upfront_build_billions >}} upfront development cost)

The math works. The challenge is execution.

### Q: How confident are you in these numbers?

**A**: Central estimates are conservative:

- Peace dividend uses 1% (could be 2-5% over time)
- dFDA uses 50% R&D savings (Oxford RECOVERY showed 80-100×)
- Excludes many hard-to-quantify benefits (innovation, rare diseases, etc.)

**Even in worst-case scenarios** (conservative column), the ICER is still -$170,514/QALY.

The intervention is **robustly dominant** across all reasonable parameter ranges.

### Q: Is it misleading to say society pays $0 when the campaign is investor-funded?

**A**: This depends on perspective:

**From society's aggregate perspective**: The $1.0B campaign cost is real money that someone must provide initially. However, since investors get repaid with {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns from redirected military spending, the net cost to society approaches $0 after payback.

**From taxpayers' perspective**: They give up {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} in military spending but receive {{< var treaty_total_annual_benefits >}} in economic benefits (peace dividend + R&D savings). Net gain: $137B.

**From investors' perspective**: They invest {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} and receive {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year perpetually. This is the best investment in history.

**The key insight**: Traditional ICER assumes spending society's resources on health interventions. Here, you're redirecting resources from **destructive uses** (war) to **productive uses** (medical research). The "cost" is really just stopping waste.

### Q: Isn't redirecting military spending politically impossible?

**A**: That's what the $1.0B campaign budget is for - making the politically impossible become inevitable through:

- Broad public engagement showing overwhelming public support (80%+ want less war, more cures)
- VICTORY Social Impact Bonds that make supporting the treaty more profitable than opposing it
- AI-assisted policy outreach and government consultation that's 60-80% more cost-effective than traditional campaigns
- Creating unstoppable momentum in pilot countries first

The math shows it's worth trying. Even a 10% chance of success has positive expected value given the enormous returns.
