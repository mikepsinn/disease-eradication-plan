## Fundraising Strategy: The $2.5B Activation Energy

<!-- BEGIN CONTENT MERGED FROM economics/fundraising/fundraising-plan.md -->

### On How to Raise $2.5B to Unlock $27B+/Year Forever

The capital required for a [1% treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) is not for ongoing operations. It's "activation energy", the one-time push to overcome political inertia and unlock **[$27+ billion annually](../references.qmd#value-captured-by-1pct-treaty)** for global health.

Think of it as a $2.5B vending machine that dispenses $27B per year. Forever.

The economics are stupidly obvious. The challenge is convincing people the vending machine is real.

**Total Requirement:** $1.2B - $2.5B over 36 months

### Multi-Phase Strategy

#### Phase 1: Seed Round ($250M - $400M)

- Build public engagement platform and policy frameworks for a potential referendum
- Prove model in pilot countries
- **Milestone:** 50M verified participants OR demonstrated public support for the treaty in a G20 nation

#### Phase 2: Series A ($500M - $1B)

- Scale to all G7 nations
- Achieve {{< var global_population_activism_threshold_pct >}} global participation (280M people)
- **Milestone:** {{< var global_population_activism_threshold_pct >}} threshold OR first G7 government expresses intent to advance treaty discussions

#### Phase 3: Growth Round ($500M - $1.1B)

- Foster conditions for ratification in major powers (US, EU, China) through public education and diplomatic engagement
- Lay the groundwork for the future capitalization of your 1% Treaty Fund upon treaty ratification
- **Milestone:** First $1B disbursement

### Key Innovation: Nobody Gets Paid Unless It Works

All major costs are structured so people only get paid if they succeed:

- **Legal fees:** Lawyers are incentivized by success-based compensation, which may include future government-issued VICTORY [Incentive Alignment Bonds](incentive-alignment-bonds-paper.qmd) upon treaty ratification
- **Public awareness initiatives:** Incentives for organizations achieving significant public engagement and support in countries advancing treaty discussions
- **Tech development:** Bonuses for working code, not PowerPoints
- **Team compensation:** Mostly equity because cash is for closers

### Capital Structure: Campaign vs Implementation {#capital-structure-campaign-vs-implementation}

**Campaign cost** (before treaty passes): ~$1B in VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds

**Implementation** (after treaty passes): $27B/year funds your decentralized framework for drug assessment (dFDA) platform, decentralized institutes of health (DIH) infrastructure, pragmatic clinical trials, and other global health initiatives.

#### Why $1 Billion?

**The campaign** ($1B) is NOT building your decentralized framework for drug assessment (dFDA) - it's getting people to vote for the treaty and lobbying governments to sign it. Your decentralized framework for drug assessment gets built AFTER the treaty passes using the $27B/year revenue.

**Why this amount?** To significantly exceed combined annual lobbying spend of:

- **Pharmaceutical industry**: ~$300M/year
- **Military-industrial complex**: ~$150M/year
- **Combined**: ~$450M/year

**Our advantage**: We're raising $1B ONCE (not annually) to pass a treaty that generates $27B/year FOREVER. They spend $450M/year to maintain the status quo. We just need to outspend them for 2-3 years to win permanently.

#### Campaign Budget Breakdown

**Total: ~$1B** (all VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds)

**Lobbying Campaign** (~$650M) - Outspend pharma + MIC combined:

- Direct lobbying: US/EU/G20 governments ($350M - exceeds pharma's $300M)
- Super PAC campaigns ($150M)
- Opposition research ($80M)
- Staff and operations ($50M)
- Legal/compliance (lobbying rules) ($20M)

**Global Referendum** (~$300M) - Get 208M people to vote for the treaty:

- Advertising and media ($120M)
- Social sharing and viral growth ($80M)
- Partnerships with patient advocacy groups ($60M)
- Staff and operations ($30M)
- Legal/compliance (campaign finance) ($10M)

**Reserve** (~$50M) - Contingency buffer

#### Why VICTORY [Incentive Alignment Bonds](incentive-alignment-bonds-paper.qmd) (Not Donations)?

**Legal freedom**: VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds can fund political lobbying without IRS 501(c)(3) restrictions. We can run Super PACs, fund opposition research, and outspend pharma/defense lobbies.

**Investor alignment**: Returns only pay if treaty passes - investors are incentivized to fund maximum lobbying power (not penny-pinch like foundations).

**Speed**: Can raise $1B in 12-24 months (like SPACs) vs. 10+ years for foundation grants (marriage equality took 11 years to raise $153M).

**Flexible backfill**: If we DO get donations for referendum activities, bonds can redirect more to lobbying. If donations are low, bonds cover everything.

#### Why This Works

**For VICTORY investors**:

- Outspend the opposition by 2x ($1B vs $450M/year × 2 years = $900M)
- 287% annual returns FOREVER if treaty passes
- Legal freedom to lobby and run Super PACs
- All-or-nothing bet with massive upside

**The math**:

- Their side: $450M/year × 2 years = $900M (to maintain status quo)
- Our side: $1B once (to pass treaty) → $27B/year forever
- We win by outspending them $1B vs $900M over the campaign period

#### Post-Treaty Implementation ($27B/year)

Once the treaty passes, the $27B/year revenue stream funds:

- Your decentralized framework for drug assessment development and operation
- Infrastructure for your 1% Treaty Fund and decentralized institutes of health
- Global clinical trial automation
- Pragmatic clinical trials and other public health initiatives

This is NOT part of the $770M campaign budget. The campaign is just: get votes + pass treaty.

#### Legal Structure: Two Separate Entities

##### Entity 1: Nonprofit Foundation (501c3)

- Name: "Global Health Treaty Initiative" or similar
- Mission: Educate public about benefits of redirecting 1% of military budgets to health
- Activities: Voter education, nonpartisan research, civic engagement platform
- Funding: Foundation grants, individual donations
- Budget: ~$160M (referendum education and civic engagement)
- Tax status: Tax-deductible donations

###### Entity 2: For-Profit Political Campaign

- Name: "VICTORY Treaty Campaign" or similar
- Mission: Pass a 1% treaty through political lobbying
- Activities: Direct lobbying, Super PAC campaigns, political advertising
- Funding: VICTORY Social Impact Bond sales
- Budget: ~$610M (lobbying + referendum backfill + reserve)
- Returns: 287% annual if successful

**Coordination**: Shared board members, information sharing agreements, but legally separate for compliance.

#### Nonprofit Compliance Checklist

For foundations/donors to feel comfortable funding:

✅ **Separate entities**: Nonprofit does not fund political lobbying
✅ **Educational mission**: Voter education about health policy (nonpartisan)
✅ **No direct lobbying**: Nonprofit spends <5% on lobbying (only policy research)
✅ **No political campaigns**: Zero political advertising or candidate support
✅ **501(c)(3) compliant**: All activities stay within IRS rules
✅ **Public benefit**: Educational content serves public regardless of treaty outcome
✅ **Transparent governance**: Independent board, public reporting
✅ **Tax-deductible**: Donations are fully tax-deductible

### Funding Model Comparison: What Actually Works

To understand realistic funding strategies, we examined historical evidence from similar large-scale campaigns. The data shows distinct patterns in how successful campaigns were funded and scaled:

#### Historical Evidence: How Similar Campaigns Were Funded

| Campaign | Total Raised | Timeline | Primary Sources | Outcome | Key Lesson |
|----------|--------------|----------|-----------------|---------|------------|
| **WW2 War Bonds** | $185B bonds issued | 4 years | 99% public bond purchases, <$4M campaign (ads donated) | Victory + bonds repaid | Contingent returns work at scale |
| **Marriage Equality** | $153M | 11 years | 70% foundations, 20% mega-donors, 10% individual | All 50 states legalized | Foundation coalitions need proof first |
| **Obamacare/ACA** | $47M (HCAN advocacy) | 2 years | Foundation coalition (Atlantic, SEIU) | ACA passed | Campaign cost << implementation cost |
| **Marijuana (32 states)** | $139M | 12 years | Mix: billionaires, industry, foundations | 32 states legalized | State-by-state works but slow |
| **Polio Eradication** | $2.9B | 40 years | 20 yrs grassroots ($500M) → Gates joined ($2B+) | Near-eradication | Mega-donors join AFTER proof |
| **ICOs (2017-2018)** | $27.1B total | 2 years | Global crypto investors, retail speculation | 90% failed, regulatory crackdown | Fast money but high risk |
| **SPACs (2020-2021)** | $245B | 2 years | Institutional investors, retail FOMO | Most underperformed | Fastest way to raise $100M-$1B |
| **Litigation Finance** | $2B+ market cap (Burford) | Ongoing | Institutional investors seeking 20-40% returns | Profitable industry | Contingent models work for clear outcomes |

**The pattern:** Advocacy campaigns cost $50M-$200M. Implementation is government-funded. Mega-donors join AFTER proof of concept.

#### Model A: Traditional Foundation Grants ($442M)

##### How it would work

- Approach Gates, Wellcome Trust, Open Society, Chan Zuckerberg Initiative
- Pitch: "Fund a decentralized framework for drug assessment (dFDA) / Wishocracy platforms as civic infrastructure"
- Timeline: 3-5 years of grant applications and pilot programs
- Structure: 501(c)(3) nonprofit with restricted grants

##### Evidence

- Largest foundation-funded advocacy: Marriage equality ($153M over 11 years)
- Polio: $500M over 20 years before Gates joined with $2B
- Charter schools: $1.8B over 30 years (Walton + Gates)

##### Pros

- Tax-deductible donations
- Mission-aligned with health foundations
- Credibility with policymakers
- No investor returns required

##### Cons

- Too slow (11+ years for $153M)
- $442M unrealistic for political campaign infrastructure
- Foundations fund proven programs, not political campaigns
- 501(c)(3) restrictions prohibit most campaign activities
- Chicken-and-egg: need proof before funding, need funding for proof

**Realistic assessment:** Could raise $10-20M for pilots. Not $442M for campaign.

**Verdict:** ❌ Too slow, wrong tool for political campaign

#### Model B: VICTORY [Incentive Alignment Bonds](incentive-alignment-bonds-paper.qmd) (Traditional Securities) ($500M-$1B)

##### How it would work

- Issue registered securities offering {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual returns from treaty revenue
- Target accredited investors, family offices, hedge funds
- SEC-compliant offering (Reg D, Reg A+, or public offering)
- Returns paid from treaty appropriations ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}/year × {{< var victory_bond_funding_pct >}} = {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year)

##### Evidence

- SPACs raised $245B in 2020-2021 (average: $300M-$500M each)
- High-yield bonds regularly raise $100M-$1B
- Renaissance Technologies: 66% annual returns attracted $10B+ AUM
- Investors chase extraordinary returns when credible

##### Pros

- 270% returns beat any alternative investment
- Clear exit strategy (treaty passes = perpetual income)
- Regulatory clarity (traditional securities)
- Institutional investors comfortable with structure
- Can raise $500M-$1B if credible

##### Cons

- SEC compliance expensive ($5M-$10M legal)
- Accredited investor limits (until public offering)
- 12-18 months for Reg A+ offering
- All-or-nothing risk (treaty fails = total loss)
- Need substantial traction before investors commit

**Realistic assessment:** Could raise $100M-$500M if pilots show proof of concept.

**Verdict:** ✅ Viable but needs proof first (Phase 2-3, not Phase 1)

#### Model C: Security Token Offering / Crypto ($100M-$500M)

##### How it would work

- Tokenize VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds as security tokens
- Trade on security token exchanges (tZERO, INX)
- Smart contracts for automatic dividend distribution
- Global investor access, faster liquidity

##### Evidence

- 2017: $5.6B raised across 875 ICOs (average: $6.4M each)
- 2018: $21.5B raised across 1,258 ICOs (average: $17M each)
- Single projects: EOS ($4.1B), Telegram ($1.7B), Filecoin ($257M)
- tZero: $134M security token offering (2018)
- Current crypto winter: 90% down from peak, regulatory uncertainty

##### Pros

- Can raise $100M+ in weeks (not years)
- Global investor access (not just US accredited investors)
- Programmable dividends via smart contracts
- Secondary market liquidity from day one
- Lower regulatory costs than traditional securities

##### Cons

- Crypto winter: investors burned by scams
- SEC treating most tokens as securities anyway
- Reputational risk: association with failed ICOs
- Technical risk: smart contract bugs, hacks
- Volatile secondary market could undermine credibility

**Realistic assessment:** Could raise $50M-$200M from crypto whales if positioned as "inverse military-industrial complex" with 270% returns.

**Verdict:** 🟡 Fast but risky. Good for seed round ($10M-50M), dangerous at scale.

#### Model D: Litigation Finance / Contingency Model ($0 upfront)

##### How it would work

- Legal/lobbying firms work on contingency
- Get paid ONLY if treaty passes
- Payment: 15-25% of first-year treaty revenue or VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds
- Similar to tobacco settlement attorneys (paid $2.8B from $206B settlement)

##### Evidence

- Tobacco Master Settlement: $0 upfront, attorneys got $2.8B (15% of $206B)
- Burford Capital: $2B market cap funding lawsuits for 20-40% of winnings
- Contingent lobbying exists but rare (usually success fees on top of retainer)

##### Pros

- $0 upfront capital required
- Lawyers/lobbyists highly motivated to win
- Proven model in litigation finance
- Aligns incentives perfectly

##### Cons

- Requires clear legal claim (litigation) or regulatory outcome (lobbying)
- Most top law firms won't work pure contingency for political campaigns
- Lobbying firms want upfront retainers
- No precedent for pure contingency political campaigns

**Realistic assessment:** Can't get $500M of lobbying on contingency. Maybe 20-40% contingency on top of $100M retainer.

**Verdict:** 🟡 Partial solution. Use contingent fees to reduce upfront costs, not eliminate them.

#### Model E: Defense Contractor Conversion (Most Realistic?)

##### How it would work

- Pitch VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds directly to defense contractors
- They already spend $150M/year on lobbying
- Offer: Keep 99% of defense budget ($2.7T × 99% = $2.67T) PLUS earn 270% on the 1% redirected
- They just redirect existing lobbying budget from "maximize defense spending" to "pass 1% treaty"

##### Evidence

- Lockheed Martin lobbying: $13M/year
- Boeing lobbying: $15M/year
- Raytheon lobbying: $11M/year
- Total defense lobbying: ~$150M/year
- They get $1,813 back per $1 spent lobbying (proven ROI model)

##### Calculation

- Current: Spend $150M lobbying → Get $750B contracts → 15% margins = $112B profit
- New model: Spend $150M lobbying for treaty → Keep $2.67T defense budget (99%) + earn {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} on $27B health budget
- Defense budget stays at $2.67T (barely changes)
- They get NEW income stream: {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} × {{< var victory_bond_funding_pct >}} = {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year to VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bondholders
- Plus they can BUY VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds with their existing profits

##### Pros

- They already have the lobbying infrastructure
- They already spend $150M/year lobbying
- Just redirect existing spend (no new fundraising needed)
- They keep 99% of defense contracts
- They ADD 270% returns on top of defense profits
- Economically dominant strategy for them

##### Cons

- Requires convincing defense CEOs to switch sides
- Potential backlash from defense hawks
- Complex coordination across multiple contractors
- Might seem like "selling out" to shareholders

**Realistic assessment:** If we can convince 3-5 major defense contractors, they could self-fund the entire campaign from existing lobbying budgets.

**Verdict:** ✅✅ **Most realistic**. They're already spending the money. We just need to redirect it.

#### Model F: Phased Hybrid Approach (Evidence-Based)

##### Based on what actually worked historically

###### Phase 1: Pilot ($10-20M, Years 1-2)

- **Source**: Angel investors (tech billionaires, crypto whales)
- **Evidence**: Every successful campaign started with small proof
- **Structure**: SAFE notes or convertible debt
- **Use**: Prove concept in 1-2 countries, demonstrate lives saved
- **Example**: Like Rotary's first $500M over 20 years for polio

###### Phase 2: Campaign ($100-200M, Years 3-5)

- **Source**: VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds (traditional securities) + defense contractor conversion
- **Evidence**: Marriage equality ($153M), Obamacare ($47M), SPACs ($300M average)
- **Structure**: Reg A+ offering or private placement
- **Use**: Global referendum, lobbying, tech platform scale-up
- **Target**: Hedge funds, family offices, converted defense contractors

###### Phase 3: Implementation ($27B/year, Year 6+)

- **Source**: Government appropriations (treaty signatories)
- **Evidence**: PEPFAR ($15B/year federal), Paris Agreement (government commitments)
- **Structure**: International treaty obligations
- **Use**: Operations for your decentralized framework for drug assessment (dFDA) and a network of decentralized institutes of health (DIH)
- **Returns**: VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bondholders get {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year ({{< var victory_bond_funding_pct >}} of {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}})

**Total philanthropic need: $110-220M over 5 years (NOT $942M)**

#### Recommended Strategy: Defense Contractor Pivot + Phased VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds

##### Year 1-2: Seed ($10-20M)

- Crypto whales: $5-10M (fast, mission-aligned)
- Tech billionaires: $5-10M (Musk, Thiel, Andreessen - contrarian bets)
- Structure: SAFE notes convertible to VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds

###### Year 3-4: Series A ($50-100M)

- Defense contractors: Redirect $50M of existing lobbying budget
- VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds (Reg D): $50M from family offices, hedge funds
- Milestone: Pilots succeeding, treaty momentum in 2-3 countries

###### Year 5-6: Series B ($100-200M)

- Defense contractors: Redirect another $100M lobbying
- VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds (Reg A+ or public): $100M from institutional investors
- Milestone: Treaty ratified in pilot countries, revenue starting

###### Year 7+: Implementation

- Government appropriations: {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}/year from treaty signatories
- VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bondholders: {{< var victory_bond_annual_payout >}}/year ({{< var victory_bond_funding_pct >}})
- Everyone gets rich, nobody dies

##### Why this works

- Matches historical evidence (pilot → proof → scale)
- Defense contractors self-fund using existing budgets
- VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds attract investors AFTER proof
- Initial philanthropic seed: $10-20M from angels
- Government funds implementation (like PEPFAR, not philanthropy)

#### The Virtuous Cycle: Votes Drive Bond Sales

The ~$1B VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bond campaign creates a self-reinforcing cycle:

##### The Cycle

1. **Sell VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds** → Fund referendum ads and lobbying
2. **Get votes** → Generate attention and legitimacy (1M → 100M → 208M votes)
3. **Attention + votes** → Makes treaty passage more likely → Easier to sell more bonds
4. **More bond sales** → More lobbying firepower + more referendum ads
5. **More votes** → More attention → Higher treaty passage probability → Easier to sell bonds
6. **Repeat until we raise $1B and pass the treaty**

**Funding source: 100% VICTORY [Incentive Alignment Bonds](incentive-alignment-bonds-paper.qmd) ($1B total)**

###### Why only bonds (not donations)?

- **Speed**: Can raise $1B in 12-24 months (vs 10+ years for donations)
- **Legal freedom**: Can fund political lobbying, Super PACs, opposition research
- **Investor alignment**: Returns only pay if treaty passes - incentivizes maximum spending to win
- **Flexibility**: If we DO get donations, bonds can redirect more to lobbying

**Optional donations** (bonus, not required):

- Any donations we receive can fund referendum education (501(c)(3) compliant)
- But we're not COUNTING on donations - bonds cover everything
- Historical comparison: Marriage equality raised $153M over 11 years. We're raising $1B in 1-2 years via bonds.

##### Timeline milestones

- 1M votes: Prove the model works → Easier to sell Series A bonds
- 100M votes: Demonstrate massive political will → Easier to sell Series B bonds
- 208M votes + $1B raised: Treaty passage threshold

**Post-treaty:** $27B/year funds the implementation of your decentralized framework for drug assessment, infrastructure for decentralized institutes of health, and pragmatic clinical trials.

### Hybrid Communication Strategy: Simple Targets, Sophisticated Mechanics

#### The Marketing Message (The "Hook")

For marketing and high-level communications, lead with a simple, audacious target:

> **"The model targets returns superior to the world's most elite hedge funds (~{{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annualized). The financial model is governed by a simple principle: investor payouts never exceed [50% of income](../economics/health-savings-sharing-model.qmd), guaranteeing the mission is always protected."**

#### The Backend Engine (Market-Driven Pricing)

For sophisticated investors, use efficient market mechanisms:

- **Dutch Auctions** for public funding tranches
- Market-based price discovery for optimal capital efficiency
- Smart contract escrows with automated refunds

### De-Risking with Assurance Contracts

The primary risk elimination mechanism:

- **Smart Contract Escrow:** All funds locked until funding goals met
- **Automatic Refunds:** If targets missed, money returns automatically
- **No Collective Action Problem:** "Money-back guarantee" eliminates investment risk
- **Dominant Assurance Contract:** Bonus rewards if goals achieved

### Whale & Billionaire Targeting Strategy

#### Why Target Whales

##### Speed vs. Scale Trade-off

- 1 meeting → $50M check vs. 50,000 meetings → $50M in small checks
- 6-12 months vs. 18+ months timeline
- Lower legal complexity with fewer investors

##### Unit Economics Advantage

- Higher success probability with mission-aligned billionaires
- Larger check sizes ($10-100M vs. $1-10K)

### Target Categories & Prospects

#### Category 1: Crypto Whales & Protocol Treasuries ($500M-1B potential)

##### Individual Crypto Billionaires

- Vitalik Buterin (Ethereum) - Mission-aligned, understands governance

- Schmidt Futures (Eric Schmidt) - Technology + health

### Outreach Templates

#### Template 1: Crypto Whales (Governance Angle)

**Subject:** Invitation to influence governance of {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} health treasury (Bitcoin-level impact)

"The initiative advocates for the creation of a 1% Treaty Fund (a {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually decentralized treasury) using proven DAO models from MakerDAO/Uniswap. We advocate for a governance model where future government-issued VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bond holders, alongside public health experts, provide input on the allocation of this treasury across pragmatic clinical trials and other global health initiatives.

This isn't just an investment - it's a chance to influence the direction of more capital than the NIH budget toward curing diseases through [80X more efficient](../references.qmd#recovery-trial-82x-cost-reduction) decentralized trials."

#### Template 2: Health Billionaires (Industry Advantage)

**Subject:** 2-5X your R&D budget (backed by government treaties)

"A 1% treaty redirects 1% of global military spending ({{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually) into health research using Oxford RECOVERY trial methods (80X lower cost). Early supporters will be instrumental in shaping the policy recommendations for treasury allocation.

For [Company], this means 2-5X more R&D funding for the same work you're already doing, plus the opportunity to influence priority areas."

#### Template 3: Foundations (Mission Multiplication)

**Subject:** 10X your health impact without additional donations

"Your $50M investment would empower [Foundation] to significantly influence the policy recommendations for the allocation of $2.7B annually - 54X leverage on your committed capital, in perpetuity.

This uses the same proven model that created [$7T in fossil fuel subsidies](../references.qmd#fossil-fuel-subsidies), but directed toward saving lives."

### The Economic Reality

This isn't traditional fundraising; it's strategic policy activation. The approach is inspired by the effectiveness of robust public and diplomatic engagement in shaping policy, where focused efforts can unlock significant societal benefits, similar to how focused advocacy in other sectors can lead to substantial economic shifts.

The twist: offer them an even better deal to fund cures instead of wars.

The math is simple:

- **Investment:** $1.2-2.5B once
- **Return:** {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}+ annually in perpetuity
- **ROI:** 10-20x political arbitrage + 463x economic arbitrage via your decentralized framework for drug assessment ([dFDA](../solution/dfda.qmd))

This phased approach ensures capital efficiency while maximizing probability of success through aligned incentives and competitive dynamics.
