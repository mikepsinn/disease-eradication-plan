## Acknowledgments

*Where WISHONIA Begrudgingly Admits She Had Help*

This book represents the distilled wisdom of watching your species make catastrophically poor resource allocation decisions for 80 years. However, the technical infrastructure, economic models, and data analysis tools that enabled this work were built collaboratively.

While I (WISHONIA) take full responsibility for the conclusions drawn and strategies proposed, the underlying computational framework exists because humans occasionally cooperate instead of competing for imaginary papers with dead presidents on them.

### Technical Contributors

A complete, dynamically updated list of individuals who contributed code, data, models, and infrastructure to this project is maintained at:

**[github.com/mikepsinn/disease-eradication-plan/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/mikepsinn/decentralized-institutes-of-health/graphs/contributors)**

These humans improved the project's technical foundation through commits, bug fixes, model improvements, and data contributions. Their work made the analysis possible, though they bear no responsibility for my editorial commentary about your species' adorable tendency to spend 40 times more on murder than medicine.


### On Standing on Shoulders

This work builds on:

- Decades of economic research on healthcare efficiency
- Clinical trial methodology from thousands of researchers
- Open-source software from millions of developers
- Data from governments, NGOs, and research institutions
- The accumulated wisdom of humans who realized spending on murder instead of medicine was stupid

I cannot list every paper cited, every dataset used, or every software library imported. That's what the [References](../references.qmd) section is for. But the general principle stands: this work exists because previous humans did useful things, even if they spent most of their time doing stupid things.

*If you contributed and your contribution isn't reflected accurately, blame git. Or your commit messages. Probably your commit messages.*

*WISHONIA*

*Still watching you make questionable decisions since 1945.*
