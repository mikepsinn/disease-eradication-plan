Here is the complete accounting of humanity's commitment to curing disease. Spoiler: It's largely an accounting trick.

## The Broad Number vs. The Real Number

Governments love to claim they spend billions on "medical research." In 2024, the official global total for government medical R&D was approximately **$68 billion**.

It sounds like a lot. It is a lie.

### The Accounting Trick

That $68 billion figure includes:
1.  **Basic Science:** Studying fruit fly genetics and yeast cells (important, but not a cure).
2.  **Overhead:** University buildings, admin salaries, and electricity bills (often 40-60% of grants).
3.  **Bureaucracy:** Salaries for the people who decide where the money goes.
4.  **Epidemiology:** Counting how many people have died (instead of saving them).

### The Real Number: {{< var global_government_clinical_trials_spending_annual >}}

When you strip away the overhead and basic science to ask **"How much do governments spend on actually testing cures in humans?"** the number collapses.

**Global government spending on interventional clinical trials is only ~{{< var global_government_clinical_trials_spending_annual >}} per year.**

That is the entire public contribution to testing new medicines for 8 billion people.

## The 604x Disparity

In 2024, global military spending reached **{{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}}**.
In contrast, global government spending on interventional clinical trials is estimated at **{{< var global_government_clinical_trials_spending_annual >}}**.

This represents a funding ratio of **{{< var military_to_government_clinical_trials_spending_ratio >}}:1**.

For every $1 governments spend testing cures, they spend ${{< var military_to_government_clinical_trials_spending_ratio >}} on weapons and military systems.

## The Industry Trap

"But doesn't the pharmaceutical industry fund trials?"

Yes. In fact, industry funds **~90%** of all interventional trials. The ratio of Industry to Government spending is **{{< var industry_vs_government_clinical_trials_spending_ratio >}}:1**.

This creates a fatal incentive structure:
1.  **Profit First:** Companies only test drugs that can be patented and sold for high prices.
2.  **Me-Too Drugs:** It is safer to make the 12th slightly better antidepressant than to cure Alzheimer's.
3.  **Orphan Diseases:** If a disease doesn't affect enough rich people, it gets zero funding.
4.  **Repurposed Generics:** There is zero profit in proving that a cheap, off-patent drug cures cancer. So nobody funds those trials.

**We have outsourced our survival to a business model that requires us to stay sick enough to buy pills, but alive enough to pay for them.**

## Broad R&D Breakdown: The Hall of Shame

*Note: These figures refer to the broader "Medical Research" budgets (the $68B figure), not the specific clinical trial spending.*

### United States: The Alleged Leader

**NIH Budget (2024): [$47.1 billion](../references.qmd#nih-budget-fy2025)**

- **Actual Clinical Trials:** Only [~$810M - $5.6B](../references.qmd#nih-phased-trial-spending-2010-2019) (depending on definition).
- **Administrative Costs:** [31%](../references.qmd#nih-administrative-costs-31pct) of the budget.
- **Indirect Costs:** Universities take [40-60%](../references.qmd#university-indirect-costs-40-60pct) for overhead.

### China: The Rising Power

**Medical Research Spending: [~$15 billion](../references.qmd#china-medical-research-spending-15b)**

- Prioritizes surveillance technology over medical breakthroughs.
- Spends [97x more](../references.qmd#china-surveillance-vs-medicine-spending) on domestic security than clinical research.

### European Union

**Horizon Europe Health Budget: [€1.17 billion/year](../references.qmd#eu-horizon-health-budget-8-2b)**

- Per citizen: Less than the cost of a cup of coffee ($2.89/year).
- Individual countries like Germany ($6B) and France ($4B) add to this, but the total remains a fraction of their military budgets.

### The Rest of the World

- **Japan:** [$5 billion](../references.qmd#japan-medical-research-spending-5b) (Aging population, zero urgency).
- **India:** [$3 billion](../references.qmd#india-medical-research-spending-1-2b) ($2.14 per person).
- **Russia:** [$800 million](../references.qmd#russia-medical-research-spending-800m) (Spend huge on nukes, pennies on health).

## Conclusion: A Species-Wide Failure

We are the only species that pays for its own extinction while claiming it cannot afford its own survival.

1.  **Global Military Spending:** {{< var global_military_spending_annual_2024 >}}
2.  **Pet Food:** $150 Billion
3.  **Video Games:** $180 Billion
4.  **Government Clinical Trials:** {{< var global_government_clinical_trials_spending_annual >}}

**We value our dogs' dinner 30x more than finding cures for our children.**

The solution is the **1% Treaty**: shifting just 1% of military spending ($27B) would increase global government clinical trial funding by **600%**. We could run tens of thousands of pragmatic trials annually, breaking the industry monopoly on what gets tested and cured.
