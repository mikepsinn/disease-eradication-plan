## How to Turn Grant-Beggars into Grant-Makers

### The Problem with Nonprofits

Every health nonprofit fights for scraps from the same tiny grant pile while the defense industry coordinates billions as a unified bloc.

This is why progress is slow. Everyone's competing instead of collaborating.

### The Offer

You're not asking nonprofits to help you beg for grants.

You're offering them a path to stop begging entirely.

Help pass the 1% Treaty, unlock a multi-billion-dollar permanent treasury, become grant-makers instead of grant-seekers. Forever.

### How to Recruit Them (Three Steps)

#### Step 1: Name the Enemy

Start by pointing at the real problem: the grant system itself.

##### What to say

"You're competing with every other health nonprofit for scraps while defense contractors coordinate $2.75 trillion as a unified bloc. That's why curing disease is slow and making bombs is fast. The system is designed to keep you fighting each other instead of the actual problem."

#### Step 2: Offer the Solution

The 1% Treaty creates a permanent \{{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}+ annual treasury for health research.

##### What this means for them

- **Bigger pie:** \{{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}+ per year, forever (60%+ increase to entire health sector)
<!-- TODO: Fix broken link - - **Your slice:** Earn governance stake based on verified contributions via ["contribute-to-earn"](../community/nonprofit-partnership-incentives.md) model. Plus keep 10% of donations you raise. -->

- **Better operations:** Shared open-source backend means less admin work, more money for actual research

##### Script

> "We've all been fighting for crumbs from a tiny pie. The 1% Treaty is how we stop fighting and bake a much larger one together. This is your path from grant-seeker to grant-maker."

#### Step 3: Ask for Specific Help

Don't ask for vague "support." Ask for concrete work toward the next milestone.

##### Current priority example

> "To get seed funding, our strategic documents need to look professional. We have a detailed plan ready. The most valuable thing you can do right now is lend talent to execute this plan. By helping with this, you're accelerating the timeline to unlock permanent funding."

### Making It Work

Once they agree, treat it like a real project.

#### Set clear expectations

- **Assign leads:** Pick someone from their team who actually has time and skills
- **Weekly check-ins:** 30 minutes, brief, focused on progress
- **Professional framing:** This is collaboration between partners, not volunteers doing favors

##### Why this matters

Treating it professionally respects their time and ensures quality work. Nonprofits are used to being asked for free help then ignored. Don't do that.
