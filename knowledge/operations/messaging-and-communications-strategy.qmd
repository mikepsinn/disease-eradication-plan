## How to Talk About Not Dying Without Sounding Insane

### Why This Matters

Your dFDA needs money and trial participants. To get both, you need to communicate in ways that:

1. Don't make people think you're a crank
2. Address their actual concerns (not what you think they should care about)
3. Get them to take action (donate, join trial, vote)

Understanding what people actually think about longevity and health research lets you craft messages that work instead of messages that sound good in meetings.

### What "Value" Means Here

Three types of returns:

- **Money:** More funding, lower cost per participant, faster recruiting
- **Positioning:** Better reputation, fewer scandals, stronger partnerships
- **Mission:** Actual acceleration of medical progress (the point of all this)

### The Work (Two Phases)

#### Phase 1: Figure Out What People Actually Think

##### What you're doing

- Find out what people hope for, fear, and misunderstand about longevity, decentralized science, and AI in medicine
- Identify who influences these opinions and where conversations happen
- Group audiences by what they believe (not what you want them to believe)

##### What you get

- **Sentiment Analysis Report:** What people think and why
- **Narrative Map:** Who's saying what, where, and to whom
- **Audience Personas:** Different groups with different concerns

#### Phase 2: Say Things That Work

##### What you're doing

- Create messaging that addresses real concerns (found in Phase 1)
- Test different messages on different audiences
- Give the team consistent talking points so you don't sound like seven different organizations

##### What you get

- **Messaging Guide:** Official positioning, key narratives, how to talk about controversial stuff
- **Tested content:** A/B tested ads, landing pages, social posts that actually convert
- **Metrics:** Conversion rates, engagement, referral performance (K-factor > 1, cost per acquisition < $0.50)

### How to Measure If This Works

Track what matters. Ignore vanity metrics.

#### What to Track and Why

| What You Care About | How You Measure It |
| --- | --- |
| **Getting Money** | • Inbound investment/grant inquiries<br>• Total funding received ($)<br>• Conversion rate (pitch → commitment)<br>• Public referendum signatures (proof of support) |
| **Getting Participants** | • Community sign-ups (future trial pool)<br>• Cost per acquisition going down<br>• Sentiment improving in target audiences |
| **Getting Partners** | • Inbound partnership requests<br>• New formal partnerships (academic, industry)<br>• Higher-profile collaborations |
| **Regulatory Buy-In** | • Positive media/policy sentiment<br>• Faster regulatory feedback<br>• Invitations to consult on policy |
| **Getting Talent** | • More qualified applicants<br>• Higher offer acceptance rate<br>• Better reputation as employer |

#### Measure Before You Start

Measure current performance first. Then deploy new messaging. Track changes. Attribute some portion to this project.

Don't skip the baseline. Otherwise you're just guessing.

#### The Money Math

Connect metrics to dollars.

##### Getting Funding

Good messaging = more successful grant proposals and investor pitches.

- If a {{< var dfda_opex_community >}} grant gets approved and messaging contributed 25% to success, that's {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}},000 in value
- Public referendum support = de-risking for investors = higher likelihood of funding

##### Getting Trial Participants (Bigger Long-Term Value)

This is where the real money is.

- **Lower recruiting costs:** Clinical trial participant acquisition costs {{< var recovery_trial_cost_per_patient >}} to $7,500 each. A 15-20% reduction from better messaging = massive savings
- **Faster recruiting:** Trial delays cost $600K-$8M per day. Recruit faster = save millions, get treatments to market sooner

##### Other Money Stuff

- Lower recruiter fees for hiring
- Faster time-to-hire for talent

#### The Non-Money Value (Still Important)

Some benefits don't convert to dollars but matter for survival:

##### Avoiding Disasters

Address public fears now = prevent backlash later. Reputation damage can kill the whole initiative.

##### Controlling the Narrative

If you don't define yourself, your critics will. Own the story or become the villain in someone else's.

##### Network Effects

Clear messaging attracts participants, researchers, developers. They attract more. Momentum builds. Or it doesn't.

### Example: The Math on $75K

**Spend:** $75,000 (sentiment analysis software, surveys, consulting)

#### Get (conservative estimates over 12 months)

1. **Help close a $1M grant** (messaging contributes 20%) = **$200,000** attributable value
2. **Successful referendum** = leverage for next funding round (increases probability of success)
3. **Cheaper future recruiting** (cut CPA from $1,000 to $850 for 1000-participant trial) = **$150,000** saved
4. **Faster recruiting** (save 30 days at $600,000/day delay cost) = **$600,000** saved

**Total value:** $200,000 + $150,000 + $600,000 = **$950,000**

**ROI:** ($950,000 - $75,000) / $75,000 = **11.67x or 1,167%**

### Summary

Good messaging isn't optional polish. It's core infrastructure.

**The financial case:** 10x+ ROI from better fundraising and cheaper participant acquisition.

**The survival case:** Mismanaging the narrative can kill the whole initiative. Managing it well accelerates everything.

**Recommendation:** Start small. Test on a single trial. Validate assumptions. Refine. Scale what works.
