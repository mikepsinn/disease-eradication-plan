If you want to end war and disease, you run into the same brick wall over and over:

* We know many things that would save millions of lives.
* We can quantify them.
* We can fund them.
* And still, governments don’t do them.

This is not because everyone in power is stupid or evil. It’s because the system is built so that:

* Politicians maximize **reelection, status, and post-office careers**, not DALYs averted.
* Bureaucracies maximize **budget, stability, and turf**, not speed of cures.
* Lobbyists maximize **client profits**, not global welfare.

You don’t fix that with “awareness,” or more white papers, or by hoping for benevolent philosopher-kings. You fix it by changing **what “self-interest” points at**.

This chapter is about a simple mechanism to do exactly that:

> **Incentive Alignment Bonds** – a way for foundations, citizens, and investors to legally and transparently pay for better global governance, without bribery, without corruption, and without giving a dollar to government budgets.

### 1. The Core Problem: Good Ideas With No Political Pathway

By the time you get to this chapter, you’ve seen the numbers:

* Redirecting just **1% of global military spending** into ultra-efficient pragmatic trials could

  * shift access to cures forward by years,
  * save hundreds of millions of lives,
  * and generate mind-bending economic value.

The 1% Treaty is not constrained by physics, biology, or even money. It’s constrained by **politics**:

* Who wants to be the politician who “cut the military”?
* Who sacrifices present-day political capital for benefits that mostly arrive after they’re out of office?
* Who risks angering powerful interest groups for diffuse, delayed gains?

From a public choice perspective, the 1% Treaty is a classic public good:

* Enormous global benefit.
* Concentrated local political pain.
* Benefits arrive later; the backlash arrives now.

In other words: **the system does exactly what it is incentivized to do.**

If we want different outcomes, we need different incentives.

### 2. What You Need: Legal Bribery That Isn't Technically Bribery

Imagine you could say to every politician on Earth:

> "If your country adopts a 1%-style reform and your citizens actually get healthier, we will:
>
> * put real money into your citizens' pockets (they'll love you),
> * upgrade your international reputation (you'll get invited to better parties),
> * and make your post-office career prospects significantly better than your rivals' (Goldman Sachs boards, prestigious fellowships, that sort of thing)."

No backroom deals. No suitcases of cash. No prison.

No money to government budgets either. They can print their own. What they can't print is external legitimacy, grateful voters, and cushy retirement gigs.

Just a standing, public, announced-in-advance rule:

> "Do this objectively good thing, and the world will systematically reward you."

This is the job of **Incentive Alignment Bonds**. It's bribery, except legal, transparent, and pointed at saving lives instead of ruining them.

---

### 3. Definition: What Are Incentive Alignment Bonds?

Incentive Alignment Bonds (IABs) are financial instruments designed to:

1. **Pay out when measurable public-good outcomes improve**, and
2. **Translate those outcomes into political, reputational, and career benefits for leaders who made them happen.**

They are not charity. (Charity doesn't work at scale.)
They are not lobbying. (That's already taken.)
They are not "paying politicians." (That's illegal, and also already taken.)

They are:

> **A way to make governments cooperate by appealing to the only thing public choice theory says they respond to: naked self-interest.**

Think of them as:

* **Social impact bonds**, but aimed at national public goods instead of whether one city's recidivism rate dropped 3%.
* **Advance Market Commitments**, but aimed at policies instead of vaccines.
* **Bribery**, but legal, transparent, and aimed at reducing human suffering instead of increasing it.

---

### 4. How Incentive Alignment Bonds Work – The Simple Version

Let’s walk through the basic structure in four steps.

#### Step 1: Define a Measurable Outcome

You choose an outcome that:

* Is **measurable** with agreed methods.
* Is **causally linked** to specific policies.
* Matters at scale.

Examples:

* Reduction in age-standardized mortality from cardiovascular disease.
* Years of life saved by earlier access to effective treatments.
* Reduction in excess mortality from pandemics.
* DALYs averted by faster access to cancer drugs.

For the 1% Treaty, an obvious candidate is:

> **DALYs averted or QALYs gained** due to earlier access to cures enabled by pragmatic trials funded from the 1% reallocation.

#### Step 2: Raise Capital

Foundations, impact investors, development banks, and perhaps even regular investors buy **Incentive Alignment Bonds**.

* The capital raised is held by an independent entity (a trust, fund, or special-purpose vehicle).
* Buyers know: “This bond pays out if and only if objectively measured public-good targets are hit.”

This is structurally similar to:

* Green bonds that pay based on environmental performance.
* Catastrophe bonds that pay based on disaster events.
* Social impact bonds that pay based on outcome metrics.

#### Step 3: Pay for Outcomes (Not Inputs)

When a country:

1. Adopts a 1%-style policy (e.g., reallocating 1% of its military budget to pragmatic clinical trials managed under transparent rules), and
2. Achieves verified improvements in health outcomes compared to a counterfactual,

the bond pays out **not to the government**, but to:

* **Citizens** (e.g., health dividends, lower insurance premiums, reduced out-of-pocket costs, free services), and/or
* **Health system actors** (clinics, hospitals, trial networks) that delivered the outcomes.

The core principle:

> Money flows to **people experiencing the benefit** and **systems delivering the benefit**, not to state budgets.

This avoids the “why pay governments, they print money” problem entirely.

#### Step 4: Make Politicians Care (Without Paying Them)

The magic is not just the cash flows; it’s what those cash flows do to **political incentives**.

Because:

* Citizens receiving benefits know *why* (the 1% policy + outcome improvements).
* Independent rating systems can give politicians a **score** based on:

  * whether they supported the policy, and
  * whether outcomes improved in their jurisdiction.
* Media, NGOs, and external coalitions can:

  * highlight high-score politicians,
  * spend more on independent campaign support for them,
  * invite them into prestigious roles after office.

No private deals.
No “you personally get money.”
Just a **standing rule**:

> “If you support this kind of high-impact policy and it works, the world will systematically make your political life easier, your legacy better, and your post-office prospects brighter.”

That is **public choice-compatible** incentive alignment.

In mechanism design terms: the politician's utility function is roughly:

> U = P(reelection) + career advancement + post-office income + status/legacy

IABs make supporting 1%-equivalent policies **strictly increase all four terms**. No altruism required. The mechanism is *incentive-compatible*: the privately optimal action (maximize personal payoff) and the socially optimal action (support policies that reduce suffering) become identical.

### 4a. The Three-Layer Architecture (How to Not Go to Prison)

The previous section described the *what*. This section describes the *how*, in enough detail that a lawyer could implement it without anyone getting indicted.

The key insight: you cannot legally say "support Bill #XYZ123 and get paid." That's bribery. People go to prison for that. It's also inefficient because you'd have to bribe every politician individually, which doesn't scale.

But you *can* create a system where politicians who support a **class of pro-social policies** systematically get more electoral support, better reputations, and better post-office careers. The trick is: rule-based, ex-ante, universal mechanisms. No targeting individuals. No secret deals. Just standing rules that happen to reward saving lives.

Here's the architecture:

#### Layer A: Outcome and Policy Scoring (Data Only)

Create an independent scoring system that assigns each politician a **Public Good Score** based on:

**Outcome metrics** (jurisdiction-level):
* DALYs averted
* Age-standardized mortality reduction
* Excess mortality trends
* Disease-specific survival rates

**Policy action metrics** (individual-level):
* Votes in favor of "1%-equivalent" measures
* Sponsorship of such bills
* Public commitments and campaign positions
* Blocking harmful reversals

Critical design choice: **Don't tie scores to "The 1% Treaty" specifically.** Define a policy class:

> "Policies that reallocate ≥1% of national military spending into independently governed pragmatic clinical trials with open data and outcome-based evaluation."

Any politician supporting *any* policy matching this pattern gets credit. This avoids the "paying for your specific bill" problem entirely.

The scoring system is:
* **Public** (anyone can see the methodology and data)
* **Rules-based** (no discretion, no case-by-case decisions)
* **Non-partisan** (applies equally to all parties and ideologies)

#### Layer B: Electoral and Reputational Benefits (Separate Actors)

Independent entities, legally separate from the scoring system, can commit **ex ante** to favor high-scoring politicians:

**501(c)(4) organizations and PACs can:**
* Spend more on independent ads and voter turnout for higher-scoring candidates
* Run comparative campaigns: "Senator Smith scored 23 on the Public Good Index. His opponent scored 78. One of them wants you to keep dying."

**NGOs and media can:**
* Publish annual rankings of politicians by Public Good Score
* Feature high-scorers at conferences (politicians love conferences)
* Create awards (politicians love awards even more than conferences)

The goal is to make the Public Good Score as influential as existing trusted benchmarks:
* **Freedom House** scores shape how democracies are perceived globally
* **Transparency International** rankings affect investment and diplomatic relationships  
* **Credit ratings** (Moody's, S&P) directly constrain sovereign borrowing costs

Moody's can downgrade a country's credit rating and suddenly their borrowing costs go up. That's power. If the Public Good Score achieves similar salience:
* High score → respect, invitations, soft power, legacy, better book deals
* Low score → reputational cost, fewer opportunities, awkward questions at dinner parties

That's a direct self-interest lever that requires no altruism to activate. Politicians don't need to become better people. They just need to notice which direction the incentives are pointing.

**Key constraints:**
* No private deals ("we promise *you* specifically")
* Just standing rules ("we support *any* candidate with Score ≥ S")
* All commitments made publicly and in advance

This is exactly how NRA grades, League of Conservation Voters scores, and Chamber of Commerce ratings already shape political behavior. The difference is the metric: instead of "did you vote for our narrow interest," it's "did you vote for policies that measurably reduced human suffering."

#### Layer C: Post-Office Career Benefits (The Goldman Sachs Board Problem)

After politicians leave office, they want prestigious jobs. Board seats. Fellowships. Speaking fees. This is called "the revolving door" and it's usually pointed at whoever paid the most lobbyists.

You can point it somewhere else.

Foundations, think tanks, and impact funds can establish:

> "Eligibility for certain fellowships, advisory roles, and governance positions is restricted to former leaders from jurisdictions that:
> 1. Adopted a 1%-equivalent policy during their tenure, and
> 2. Achieved threshold improvements on agreed health metrics."

Politicians know this rule **in advance**. Their calculation becomes:
* Support 1%-style reform → prestigious fellowships, advisory boards, speaking circuits, book deals
* Oppose it → you can still get a job, but it won't be as good, and you'll have to explain why you voted against curing diseases

No one is paid for a specific vote. There's just a standing rule that systematically advantages leaders who governed well by objective metrics. It's the revolving door, except spinning toward "saved lives" instead of "defense contractor profits."

#### Legal Entity Separation

The three layers must be housed in legally distinct entities:

| Layer | Entity Type | Can Do | Cannot Do |
|:------|:------------|:-------|:----------|
| Scoring | 501(c)(3) or independent research org | Fund metrics, dashboards, public data | Support/oppose candidates |
| Electoral | 501(c)(4), PAC, or Super PAC | Independent expenditures favoring high-scorers | Coordinate with candidates |
| Post-office | Private foundations, think tanks | Set eligibility criteria for positions | Condition grants on specific votes |

This separation is not a loophole; it's how the system maintains legitimacy. Each layer does what it's legally permitted to do, and the combined effect is that supporting 1%-equivalent policies becomes the utility-maximizing choice for rational politicians.

### 4b. A Worked Example: Portugal Saves Lives and Gets Rich

Abstract mechanisms are great for economists and terrible for everyone else. Here's how IABs actually work, using Portugal as an example because it's small enough to pilot and large enough to matter:

**Year 0: Setup**
* Portugal announces it will reallocate 1% of military spending (approximately €45M/year) to pragmatic clinical trials
* An IAB fund raises €200M from impact investors and foundations
* Baseline metrics established: current DALY burden, cardiovascular mortality, cancer survival rates

**Years 1-3: Implementation**
* Portuguese health system runs 50 pragmatic trials using the RECOVERY model
* Several treatments show significant efficacy; adoption accelerates
* Independent evaluators track outcomes against counterfactual (what would have happened without the policy)

**Year 4: Payout Trigger**
* Evaluators verify: 15,000 DALYs averted compared to counterfactual
* At €5,000 per DALY (conservative valuation), that's €75M in health value created
* IAB pays out €50M to:
  * Portuguese citizens (€20M as health dividend, ~€2 per person)
  * Portuguese hospitals and clinics that participated in trials (€20M)
  * Trial infrastructure for continued operation (€10M)

**Political consequences:**
* Portuguese Prime Minister's Public Good Score rises from 52 to 78
* Independent campaign groups in upcoming election spend €5M more on GOTV for incumbents who supported the policy
* Three former health ministers receive invitations to join WHO advisory committees
* Spanish and Italian politicians notice; both countries begin drafting similar legislation

**Year 5+: Cascade**
* Spain and Italy adopt 1%-equivalent policies (FOMO is a powerful force in international relations)
* IAB fund raises another €500M based on demonstrated success
* EU begins discussing continent-wide framework
* Someone gives a TED talk about it

No one was bribed. Money went to citizens and health systems. Politicians benefited because their voters benefited, because rule-based systems rewarded good governance, and because humans are fundamentally self-interested creatures who respond to incentives.

This is not cynical. This is public choice theory. It's only cynical if you think politicians should be motivated by pure altruism, in which case I have some bad news about the last 5,000 years of recorded history.

### 5. Why This Is Not Bribery

At first glance, paying money when policies pass and outcomes improve might sound like “fancy bribery.” It’s not, for four reasons:

1. **No one is paid to break a duty.**

   * Bribery = paying an official to violate their legal or ethical obligations.
   * IABs reward *compliance with* duties: improving population health using legal policy tools.

2. **Rules are universal and ex-ante.**

   * The mechanism applies to all politicians and parties, openly and in advance.
   * There are no secret deals, no targeting of individuals.

3. **Money goes to citizens and systems, not to politicians or government budgets.**

   * Citizens benefit from earlier cures, lower costs, or direct transfers.
   * The political benefits are indirect: better reelection chances, reputation, and post-office roles, driven by public metrics.

4. **Outcomes must be objectively verified.**

   * An independent "impact oracle" measures the improvements using transparent data and methods.
   * Payments depend on real, audited progress, not announcements or promises.

Bribery **corrupts** alignment.
Incentive Alignment Bonds **create** alignment.

### 5a. Impact Oracle Governance: Who Decides If You Actually Saved Lives?

"Independent impact oracle" sounds like something from a fantasy novel or a crypto whitepaper. This section makes it concrete enough that skeptical economists stop rolling their eyes.

The impact oracle determines whether a country actually achieved health improvements or just claimed to. If the oracle can be captured, corrupted, or politically influenced, the entire mechanism collapses into the same mess as everything else humans have tried.

Here's how to make it robust enough that gaming it costs more than just doing the right thing:

#### Structure: Federated Verification

No single organization should have sole authority to verify outcomes. Instead, use a federated model:

1. **Multiple independent assessors** (at least three) must agree before a payout is triggered
2. **Diverse institutional types**: academic institutions, multilateral organizations, commercial auditors
3. **Geographic diversity**: assessors should span different regions to reduce political capture
4. **Rotating membership**: no assessor serves more than 5 consecutive years

Example federation for health metrics:
* Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)
* Lancet Commission on Health Metrics
* WHO Statistical Division
* One rotating commercial auditor (PwC, Deloitte, etc.)

Payout requires: 3 of 4 assessors agree outcomes met threshold.

#### Metrics: Hard to Manipulate

The oracle measures outcomes, not inputs or promises. Preferred metrics:

| Metric | Why It's Hard to Game |
|:-------|:----------------------|
| All-cause mortality (age-standardized) | Requires falsifying death certificates at scale. Possible but expensive. |
| Cause-specific DALYs (GBD methodology) | Cross-validated by multiple data sources. Would need to corrupt several independent institutions simultaneously. |
| Excess mortality vs counterfactual | Computed from population-level data. Can't hide bodies. |
| Trial enrollment and completion rates | Verified by independent trial registries. Patients notice if they didn't actually enroll. |

Metrics to avoid (too gameable):
* Self-reported health status (people lie)
* "Access to care" definitions (bureaucrats can redefine anything)
* Policy adoption announcements (signing a document isn't the same as saving lives)

#### Pre-Registration and Transparency

All assessment methods must be:
* **Pre-registered** before any country begins implementation
* **Published** in full methodological detail
* **Versioned** with change logs if adjustments are needed
* **Open to challenge** via a formal dispute resolution process

If an assessor deviates from pre-registered methodology without documented justification, their assessment is excluded.

#### Dispute Resolution

When countries disagree with oracle determinations:

1. **Technical appeal**: Country submits alternative data or methodology critique; independent panel reviews
2. **Arbitration**: If technical appeal fails, binding arbitration by a neutral body (e.g., Permanent Court of Arbitration health panel)
3. **No self-assessment**: Countries cannot assess their own outcomes, ever

This structure doesn't make the oracle perfect. It makes capture expensive enough that it's not worth attempting.

### 6. How IABs Differ from Social Impact Bonds and Other Tools

People sometimes hear this and say, "We already have Social Impact Bonds." We don't, not at this scale or with this purpose.

Key differences:

1. **Scale and target.**

   * Social Impact Bonds: municipal, specific programs (e.g., recidivism in one city).
   * IABs: national or global, aimed at **systemic public goods** (e.g., faster cures, pandemic preparedness).

2. **Who is being incentivized.**

   * Social Impact Bonds: service providers.
   * IABs: entire governments and the political class, via citizen benefits and reputational/electoral feedback loops.

3. **Type of outcome.**

   * Social Impact Bonds: narrow, local metrics.
   * IABs: macro health, safety, and resilience metrics that affect millions.

4. **Purpose.**

   * Social Impact Bonds: “innovative financing” for programs.
   * IABs: **governance technology** – a new way of steering state behavior toward global public goods.

Think of Social Impact Bonds as pilot projects.
Incentive Alignment Bonds are an attempt to **change the rules of the game.**

---

### 7. Incentive Alignment Bonds and the 1% Treaty

So how does this plug into the bigger project of ending war and disease?

The 1% Treaty says:

> “Let’s take 1% of global military spending and redirect it to ultra-efficient pragmatic trials, giving the world earlier access to cures and making us safer than any new weapons system could.”

Incentive Alignment Bonds provide **the missing financial and political mechanism** that makes this more than a beautiful PDF:

1. **Funding the transition.**

   * IABs can provide transition capital to:

     * set up pragmatic trial networks,
     * build data infrastructure,
     * bootstrap early interventions.

2. **Rewarding early adopters.**

   * Countries that move first and show measurable improvements can unlock IAB payouts for their citizens, creating a “race to the top.”

3. **Creating political pressure.**

   * High-performing countries get higher scores, more coverage, and more external support for their leaders.
   * Voters can see clear benefits tied to specific policies.

4. **Aligning global and national interests.**

   * Global funders care about reducing disease and existential risk.
   * National leaders care about reelection, reputation, and economic gains.
   * IABs connect these two in a legal, transparent way.

The 1% Treaty describes the **what**.
Incentive Alignment Bonds help supply the **how**.

---

### 7a. How IABs Relate to VICTORY Bonds

If you've read the [VICTORY Bonds chapter](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd), you might wonder: "Aren't these the same thing?" They're complementary, not identical.

**VICTORY Bonds** are designed to:
* Raise capital ($1B+) to fund the campaign that *passes* the 1% Treaty
* Pay investors perpetual returns (270%+ annually) from the treaty funding stream *after* it passes
* Align investor interests with treaty passage: "If the treaty passes, you get paid forever."

**Incentive Alignment Bonds** are designed to:
* Reward countries and populations *after* they've adopted 1%-equivalent policies
* Pay out based on *measured health outcomes*, not just policy adoption
* Align politician interests with good governance: "If your constituents' health improves, you get reputational and career benefits."

The relationship is sequential:

| Phase | Financial Instrument | Purpose |
|:------|:---------------------|:--------|
| Pre-Treaty | VICTORY Bonds | Fund the campaign; align investor capital with treaty passage |
| Post-Treaty | Incentive Alignment Bonds | Reward countries for measurable outcomes; create race-to-the-top dynamics |

VICTORY Bonds get the treaty passed. IABs ensure the treaty actually delivers results.

You can think of VICTORY Bonds as funding the **political war** and IABs as funding the **ongoing campaign** to ensure countries don't just sign treaties but actually improve health outcomes.

---

### 8. Objections and Failure Modes

No mechanism is magic. It is worth being explicit about what can go wrong.

#### Objection 1: "Won't politicians game the metrics?"

Yes. Obviously. Politicians game everything. That's what they do.

The question isn't "will they try to game it?" The question is "is gaming it harder than just doing the right thing?"

To game IAB metrics, you'd need to:
* Falsify death certificates at scale (hard, people notice when relatives aren't dead)
* Corrupt multiple independent international health organizations simultaneously (expensive)
* Maintain the lie across rotating assessors over many years (exhausting)

Or you could just... run some clinical trials and save lives. That's actually easier.

Gaming is a risk. But it's easier to harden a metric than to harden every informal lobbying channel on Earth. Right now, there are no metrics. The gaming is free and unlimited.

#### Objection 2: "Isn't this just rich people buying policy?"

This is the most important objection, so let's take it seriously instead of hand-waving.

If IABs are just plutocracy with better marketing, they deserve to fail. Let's see if they are.

**First, the uncomfortable reality:** Wealthy actors *already* buy policy. They do it via lobbying, revolving doors, campaign finance, and regulatory capture. The pharmaceutical industry alone spends over $300 million annually on lobbying in the United States. Defense contractors spend more. The question is not "should money influence policy?" but rather "given that money *already* influences policy, can we channel that influence toward measurable global welfare instead of narrow interests?"

**Second, the structural safeguards:**

1. **No quid pro quo.** The three-layer architecture explicitly separates scoring (data), electoral support (issue campaigns), and post-office benefits (standing eligibility rules). No one can say "vote for X, get Y." There are only standing rules: "Any politician who supports this *class* of policies will score higher on this public metric, and entities that care about that metric may independently favor high-scorers."

2. **Universal and ex-ante rules.** Every politician faces the same scoring system, announced publicly in advance. A left-wing politician who supports 1%-equivalent health policy gets the same credit as a right-wing one. The system is indifferent to party, ideology, and individual identity.

3. **Money flows to citizens, not politicians.** When IABs pay out, the money goes to people who received health benefits and systems that delivered those benefits. Politicians get *indirect* benefits: higher approval from grateful constituents, better scores on public metrics, and standing eligibility for post-office positions. This is how representative democracy is *supposed* to work; leaders benefit when their constituents benefit.

4. **The metric is suffering reduced, not interests served.** Traditional influence-buying delivers policies that benefit narrow groups at diffuse public expense. IABs do the opposite: they reward policies that deliver diffuse public benefits even when narrow groups oppose them. The direction of distortion is reversed.

**Third, the honest admission:** Yes, wealthy people who fund IABs will have more influence over which public goods get prioritized than people who don't fund IABs. That's true of all philanthropy. The Gates Foundation has more influence over malaria policy than a random person who also cares about malaria. The question is whether that influence is being exercised transparently, toward measurable welfare improvements, through legal and auditable channels. IABs satisfy all three criteria in ways that traditional lobbying does not.

#### Objection 3: "What if governments take the health gains but reverse the policy later?"

They might. Politicians are humans, and humans have short attention spans and shorter terms.

Countermeasures:

* **Clawback clauses**: Payouts spread over time, conditional on maintaining reforms. Take the money and run? The money runs back.
* **Long-term metrics**: Reward durability, not just one-off changes. "You signed a document" is worth less than "you maintained the system for five years."
* **Political scorecards**: Reversals tank your Public Good Score. The same mechanism that rewarded you for supporting the policy punishes you for killing it.

You cannot prevent all backsliding. But you can make it expensive enough that it's not the default move.

#### Objection 4: "Is this realistic at a global scale?"

It doesn't have to start global. Global is the goal. Portugal is the pilot.

The path:

1. **One or two pilot countries** adopt a limited 1%-style policy with IAB support. (Portugal, Costa Rica, maybe New Zealand - small, functional democracies with something to prove.)
2. **Outcomes are measured**; citizens benefit; leaders get invited to better conferences.
3. **Other countries notice** and copy what works, as they already do with credit ratings, trade agreements, and health system reforms. FOMO is a powerful force in international relations.

Credit ratings didn't start as a global system. They started as one guy in the 1800s publishing opinions about railroad bonds. Now Moody's can tank a country's economy with a press release.

IABs can scale the same way: proof of concept → adoption by early movers → FOMO among laggards → new normal.

### 9. Why This Matters for Ending War and Disease

Ending war and disease is not primarily a **scientific** problem; it is a **governance** problem.

We already know:

* How to prevent many pandemics.
* How to reduce cardiovascular and infectious disease.
* How to run pragmatic trials at a fraction of current cost.
* That 1% of war budgets could transform the health landscape.

What’s missing is:

* a credible way for the public and global funders to **reward** governments for doing these things,
* using tools that are legal, transparent, and consistent with human self-interest.

Incentive Alignment Bonds give us a way to say:

> “If you govern well by these objective metrics, the world will make your citizens wealthier and healthier, your political life easier, and your future brighter.”

That does not guarantee success.
But it changes the game from “hope someone in power cares enough” to:

> “Let’s build a system where caring enough is the best selfish move a leader can make.”

If ending war and disease is about anything, it is about that:
**reprogramming the incentive landscape so that the easiest and most rewarding path for powerful actors is the path that saves the most lives.**

Incentive Alignment Bonds are one of the simplest, most scalable tools we have to do that.

---

### 10. Summary: The Mechanism in One Sentence

Create an **independent, outcome-indexed system** where hitting big public-good targets (funded by Incentive Alignment Bonds) automatically:

* pays citizens (they like this),
* boosts the reelection chances of politicians who made it happen (they like this more),
* upgrades their status and post-office career prospects (they like this most),

all via pre-announced, universal rules and independent institutions—so it's legally clean, incentive-compatible, and doesn't give a dollar to government budgets.

It's bribery, except legal, transparent, and aimed at saving lives.

You're not asking politicians to be better people. You're just making "save lives" and "advance career" point in the same direction. The rest is just self-interest doing what self-interest does.
