If you want to end war and disease, you run into the same brick wall over and over:

* We know many things that would save millions of lives.
* We can quantify them.
* We can fund them.
* And still, governments don’t do them.

This is not because everyone in power is stupid or evil. It’s because the system is built so that:

* Politicians maximize **reelection, status, and post-office careers**, not DALYs averted.
* Bureaucracies maximize **budget, stability, and turf**, not speed of cures.
* Lobbyists maximize **client profits**, not global welfare.

You don’t fix that with “awareness,” or more white papers, or by hoping for benevolent philosopher-kings. You fix it by changing **what “self-interest” points at**.

This chapter is about a simple mechanism to do exactly that:

> **Incentive Alignment Bonds** – a way for foundations, citizens, and investors to legally and transparently pay for better global governance, without bribery, without corruption, and without giving a dollar to government budgets.

### 1. The Core Problem: Good Ideas With No Political Pathway

By the time you get to this chapter, you’ve seen the numbers:

* Redirecting just **1% of global military spending** into ultra-efficient pragmatic trials could

  * shift access to cures forward by years,
  * save hundreds of millions of lives,
  * and generate mind-bending economic value.

The 1% Treaty is not constrained by physics, biology, or even money. It’s constrained by **politics**:

* Who wants to be the politician who “cut the military”?
* Who sacrifices present-day political capital for benefits that mostly arrive after they’re out of office?
* Who risks angering powerful interest groups for diffuse, delayed gains?

From a public choice perspective, the 1% Treaty is a classic public good:

* Enormous global benefit.
* Concentrated local political pain.
* Benefits arrive later; the backlash arrives now.

In other words: **the system does exactly what it is incentivized to do.**

If we want different outcomes, we need different incentives.

### 2. What We Really Need: A Legal Way to Buy Better Behavior

Imagine you could say, as a coordinated global public:

> “If your country adopts a 1%-style reform and actually improves health outcomes, we will:
>
> * put real money into your citizens’ pockets,
> * upgrade your reputation,
> * and quietly make your career and reelection prospects much better than your rivals’.”

No backroom deals.
No “vote for X and get a suitcase.”
No money to government budgets (they can print their own).

Just a standing, public rule:

> “If you do **this** objectively good thing, the world will **automatically reward you**.”

That is the job of **Incentive Alignment Bonds**.

### 3. Definition: What Are Incentive Alignment Bonds?

Incentive Alignment Bonds (IABs) are a class of financial instruments designed to:

1. **Pay out when measurable public-good outcomes improve**, and
2. **Translate those outcomes into political, reputational, and career benefits for the leaders who made them happen.**

They are not charity.
They are not lobbying.
They are not “paying politicians.”

They are:

> **A way for private capital and philanthropy to reward improvements in global public goods, using clear metrics and rule-based mechanisms, in a way that makes it self-interested for governments to cooperate.**

Think of them as:

* Social impact bonds, but aimed at **national public goods**, not local projects.
* Advance Market Commitments, but aimed at **policies**, not just products.
* A lawful, transparent, “anti-bribery” version of paying for good governance.

---

### 4. How Incentive Alignment Bonds Work – The Simple Version

Let’s walk through the basic structure in four steps.

#### Step 1: Define a Measurable Outcome

You choose an outcome that:

* Is **measurable** with agreed methods.
* Is **causally linked** to specific policies.
* Matters at scale.

Examples:

* Reduction in age-standardized mortality from cardiovascular disease.
* Years of life saved by earlier access to effective treatments.
* Reduction in excess mortality from pandemics.
* DALYs averted by faster access to cancer drugs.

For the 1% Treaty, an obvious candidate is:

> **DALYs averted or QALYs gained** due to earlier access to cures enabled by pragmatic trials funded from the 1% reallocation.

#### Step 2: Raise Capital

Foundations, impact investors, development banks, and perhaps even regular investors buy **Incentive Alignment Bonds**.

* The capital raised is held by an independent entity (a trust, fund, or special-purpose vehicle).
* Buyers know: “This bond pays out if and only if objectively measured public-good targets are hit.”

This is structurally similar to:

* Green bonds that pay based on environmental performance.
* Catastrophe bonds that pay based on disaster events.
* Social impact bonds that pay based on outcome metrics.

#### Step 3: Pay for Outcomes (Not Inputs)

When a country:

1. Adopts a 1%-style policy (e.g., reallocating 1% of its military budget to pragmatic clinical trials managed under transparent rules), and
2. Achieves verified improvements in health outcomes compared to a counterfactual,

the bond pays out **not to the government**, but to:

* **Citizens** (e.g., health dividends, lower insurance premiums, reduced out-of-pocket costs, free services), and/or
* **Health system actors** (clinics, hospitals, trial networks) that delivered the outcomes.

The core principle:

> Money flows to **people experiencing the benefit** and **systems delivering the benefit**, not to state budgets.

This avoids the “why pay governments, they print money” problem entirely.

#### Step 4: Make Politicians Care (Without Paying Them)

The magic is not just the cash flows; it’s what those cash flows do to **political incentives**.

Because:

* Citizens receiving benefits know *why* (the 1% policy + outcome improvements).
* Independent rating systems can give politicians a **score** based on:

  * whether they supported the policy, and
  * whether outcomes improved in their jurisdiction.
* Media, NGOs, and external coalitions can:

  * highlight high-score politicians,
  * spend more on independent campaign support for them,
  * invite them into prestigious roles after office.

No private deals.
No “you personally get money.”
Just a **standing rule**:

> “If you support this kind of high-impact policy and it works, the world will systematically make your political life easier, your legacy better, and your post-office prospects brighter.”

That is **public choice-compatible** incentive alignment.

### 4a. The Three-Layer Architecture (How It Actually Works Legally)

The previous section described the *what*. This section describes the *how*, in enough detail that a lawyer could implement it.

The key insight: you cannot legally say "support Bill #XYZ123 and get paid." That's bribery. But you *can* create a system where politicians who support a **class of pro-social policies** systematically get more electoral support, better reputations, and better post-office careers, all through rule-based, ex-ante, universal mechanisms.

Here's the architecture:

#### Layer A: Outcome and Policy Scoring (Data Only)

Create an independent scoring system that assigns each politician a **Public Good Score** based on:

**Outcome metrics** (jurisdiction-level):
* DALYs averted
* Age-standardized mortality reduction
* Excess mortality trends
* Disease-specific survival rates

**Policy action metrics** (individual-level):
* Votes in favor of "1%-equivalent" measures
* Sponsorship of such bills
* Public commitments and campaign positions
* Blocking harmful reversals

Critical design choice: **Don't tie scores to "The 1% Treaty" specifically.** Define a policy class:

> "Policies that reallocate ≥1% of national military spending into independently governed pragmatic clinical trials with open data and outcome-based evaluation."

Any politician supporting *any* policy matching this pattern gets credit. This avoids the "paying for your specific bill" problem entirely.

The scoring system is:
* **Public** (anyone can see the methodology and data)
* **Rules-based** (no discretion, no case-by-case decisions)
* **Non-partisan** (applies equally to all parties and ideologies)

#### Layer B: Electoral and Reputational Benefits (Separate Actors)

Independent entities, legally separate from the scoring system, can commit **ex ante** to favor high-scoring politicians:

**501(c)(4) organizations and PACs can:**
* Spend more on independent ads and voter turnout for higher-scoring candidates
* Run comparative campaigns highlighting score differences between candidates

**NGOs and media can:**
* Publish annual rankings of politicians by Public Good Score
* Feature high-scorers in conferences, interviews, and reports
* Create awards and recognition programs

**Key constraints:**
* No private deals ("we promise *you* specifically")
* Just standing rules ("we support *any* candidate with Score ≥ S")
* All commitments made publicly and in advance

This is exactly how NRA grades, League of Conservation Voters scores, and Chamber of Commerce ratings already shape political behavior. The difference is the metric: instead of "did you vote for our narrow interest," it's "did you vote for policies that measurably reduced human suffering."

#### Layer C: Post-Office Career Benefits (Rule-Based Eligibility)

Foundations, think tanks, and impact funds can establish:

> "Eligibility for certain fellowships, advisory roles, and governance positions is restricted to former leaders from jurisdictions that:
> 1. Adopted a 1%-equivalent policy during their tenure, and
> 2. Achieved threshold improvements on agreed health metrics."

Politicians know the rule **in advance**. Their self-interest calculation becomes:
* Support 1%-style reform → more prestigious options after leaving office
* Oppose it → fewer options

No one is paid for a specific vote. There's just a standing rule that systematically advantages leaders who governed well by objective metrics.

#### Legal Entity Separation

The three layers must be housed in legally distinct entities:

| Layer | Entity Type | Can Do | Cannot Do |
|:------|:------------|:-------|:----------|
| Scoring | 501(c)(3) or independent research org | Fund metrics, dashboards, public data | Support/oppose candidates |
| Electoral | 501(c)(4), PAC, or Super PAC | Independent expenditures favoring high-scorers | Coordinate with candidates |
| Post-office | Private foundations, think tanks | Set eligibility criteria for positions | Condition grants on specific votes |

This separation is not a loophole; it's how the system maintains legitimacy. Each layer does what it's legally permitted to do, and the combined effect is that supporting 1%-equivalent policies becomes the utility-maximizing choice for rational politicians.

### 4b. A Worked Example: Portugal Pilots a 1%-Equivalent Policy

Abstract mechanisms need concrete examples. Here's how IABs might work for a mid-sized country:

**Year 0: Setup**
* Portugal announces it will reallocate 1% of military spending (approximately €45M/year) to pragmatic clinical trials
* An IAB fund raises €200M from impact investors and foundations
* Baseline metrics established: current DALY burden, cardiovascular mortality, cancer survival rates

**Years 1-3: Implementation**
* Portuguese health system runs 50 pragmatic trials using the RECOVERY model
* Several treatments show significant efficacy; adoption accelerates
* Independent evaluators track outcomes against counterfactual (what would have happened without the policy)

**Year 4: Payout Trigger**
* Evaluators verify: 15,000 DALYs averted compared to counterfactual
* At €5,000 per DALY (conservative valuation), that's €75M in health value created
* IAB pays out €50M to:
  * Portuguese citizens (€20M as health dividend, ~€2 per person)
  * Portuguese hospitals and clinics that participated in trials (€20M)
  * Trial infrastructure for continued operation (€10M)

**Political consequences:**
* Portuguese Prime Minister's Public Good Score rises from 52 to 78
* Independent campaign groups in upcoming election spend €5M more on GOTV for incumbents who supported the policy
* Three former health ministers receive invitations to join WHO advisory committees
* Spanish and Italian politicians notice; both countries begin drafting similar legislation

**Year 5+: Cascade**
* Spain and Italy adopt 1%-equivalent policies
* IAB fund raises another €500M based on demonstrated success
* EU begins discussing continent-wide framework

No one was bribed. Money went to citizens and health systems. Politicians benefited because their voters benefited and because rule-based systems rewarded good governance.

### 5. Why This Is Not Bribery

At first glance, paying money when policies pass and outcomes improve might sound like “fancy bribery.” It’s not, for four reasons:

1. **No one is paid to break a duty.**

   * Bribery = paying an official to violate their legal or ethical obligations.
   * IABs reward *compliance with* duties: improving population health using legal policy tools.

2. **Rules are universal and ex-ante.**

   * The mechanism applies to all politicians and parties, openly and in advance.
   * There are no secret deals, no targeting of individuals.

3. **Money goes to citizens and systems, not to politicians or government budgets.**

   * Citizens benefit from earlier cures, lower costs, or direct transfers.
   * The political benefits are indirect: better reelection chances, reputation, and post-office roles, driven by public metrics.

4. **Outcomes must be objectively verified.**

   * An independent “impact oracle” measures the improvements using transparent data and methods.
   * Payments depend on real, audited progress, not announcements or promises.

Bribery **corrupts** alignment.
Incentive Alignment Bonds **create** alignment.

### 6. How IABs Differ from Social Impact Bonds and Other Tools

People sometimes hear this and say, "We already have Social Impact Bonds." We don't, not at this scale or with this purpose.

Key differences:

1. **Scale and target.**

   * Social Impact Bonds: municipal, specific programs (e.g., recidivism in one city).
   * IABs: national or global, aimed at **systemic public goods** (e.g., faster cures, pandemic preparedness).

2. **Who is being incentivized.**

   * Social Impact Bonds: service providers.
   * IABs: entire governments and the political class, via citizen benefits and reputational/electoral feedback loops.

3. **Type of outcome.**

   * Social Impact Bonds: narrow, local metrics.
   * IABs: macro health, safety, and resilience metrics that affect millions.

4. **Purpose.**

   * Social Impact Bonds: “innovative financing” for programs.
   * IABs: **governance technology** – a new way of steering state behavior toward global public goods.

Think of Social Impact Bonds as pilot projects.
Incentive Alignment Bonds are an attempt to **change the rules of the game.**

### 7. Incentive Alignment Bonds and the 1% Treaty

So how does this plug into the bigger project of ending war and disease?

The 1% Treaty says:

> “Let’s take 1% of global military spending and redirect it to ultra-efficient pragmatic trials, giving the world earlier access to cures and making us safer than any new weapons system could.”

Incentive Alignment Bonds provide **the missing financial and political mechanism** that makes this more than a beautiful PDF:

1. **Funding the transition.**

   * IABs can provide transition capital to:

     * set up pragmatic trial networks,
     * build data infrastructure,
     * bootstrap early interventions.

2. **Rewarding early adopters.**

   * Countries that move first and show measurable improvements can unlock IAB payouts for their citizens, creating a “race to the top.”

3. **Creating political pressure.**

   * High-performing countries get higher scores, more coverage, and more external support for their leaders.
   * Voters can see clear benefits tied to specific policies.

4. **Aligning global and national interests.**

   * Global funders care about reducing disease and existential risk.
   * National leaders care about reelection, reputation, and economic gains.
   * IABs connect these two in a legal, transparent way.

The 1% Treaty describes the **what**.
Incentive Alignment Bonds help supply the **how**.

### 8. Objections and Failure Modes

No mechanism is magic. It is worth being explicit about what can go wrong.

#### Objection 1: “Won’t politicians game the metrics?”

They will try. That’s why:

* Metrics must be designed to be **hard to manipulate** (DALYs, mortality, cause-specific trends).
* Multiple independent data sources must be used.
* Methods must be public and subject to expert review.

Gaming is a risk, but it’s easier to harden a metric than to harden every informal lobbying channel on Earth.

#### Objection 2: “Isn’t this just rich people buying policy?”

Compared to what?

Right now, wealthy actors already buy policy via:

* lobbying,
* revolving doors,
* campaign finance,
* regulatory capture.

The difference here is:

* The mechanism is **explicit**, **measured**, and tied to **global welfare improvements**.
* Money is not buying arbitrary favors; it is buying **measurable reductions in suffering**.

If the rich are going to have influence anyway, this is a way to channel it into something rational and audited.

#### Objection 3: “What if governments take the health gains but reverse the policy later?”

Policies can be reversed; that’s reality.

To reduce this:

* Some IAB structures can have **clawback clauses** (payouts spread over time, conditional on maintaining reforms).
* Long-term metrics can reward durability, not just one-off changes.
* Political scorecards can penalize reversals.

You cannot prevent all backsliding. You can make it **much more expensive**.

#### Objection 4: “Is this realistic at a global scale?”

It doesn’t have to start global.

The path is more likely:

1. One or two **pilot countries** adopt a limited 1%-style policy with IAB support.
2. Outcomes are measured; citizens benefit; leaders are rewarded.
3. Other countries copy what works, as they already do with credit ratings, trade agreements, and health system reforms.

Just as bond markets and credit ratings slowly became central to sovereign behavior, a successful IAB ecosystem can grow from proof-of-concept into norms.

### 9. Why This Matters for Ending War and Disease

Ending war and disease is not primarily a **scientific** problem; it is a **governance** problem.

We already know:

* How to prevent many pandemics.
* How to reduce cardiovascular and infectious disease.
* How to run pragmatic trials at a fraction of current cost.
* That 1% of war budgets could transform the health landscape.

What’s missing is:

* a credible way for the public and global funders to **reward** governments for doing these things,
* using tools that are legal, transparent, and consistent with human self-interest.

Incentive Alignment Bonds give us a way to say:

> “If you govern well by these objective metrics, the world will make your citizens wealthier and healthier, your political life easier, and your future brighter.”

That does not guarantee success.
But it changes the game from “hope someone in power cares enough” to:

> “Let’s build a system where caring enough is the best selfish move a leader can make.”

If ending war and disease is about anything, it is about that:
**reprogramming the incentive landscape so that the easiest and most rewarding path for powerful actors is the path that saves the most lives.**

Incentive Alignment Bonds are one of the simplest, most scalable tools we have to do that.
