![A decentralized institute of health: A new model for medical research](../../assets/icons/dih-icon-6-wide.png)

The NIH spends $47 billion a year. Scientists spend [50-67% of their time writing grant applications](../references.qmd#grant-writing-time-50pct) instead of doing research. This is not a conspiracy. It's just what happens when you design a system that rewards asking for money instead of producing results.

Here's what an alternative might look like.

A decentralized institute of health (DIH) is an alternative institutional design built on four principles.

## The Four Principles

### Rule 1: Let Patients Decide What Gets Funded

**The idea:** Give the money directly to patients in the form of subsidies. Let them, in consultation with their doctors, decide which clinical trials to join. The trials that attract patients get funded. The ones that don't, don't.

This replaces a grant-writing contest with a distributed supercomputer of millions of patients and doctors, all with skin in the game. It's the collective intelligence of humanity voting with its feet.

### Rule 2: Pay for Cures, Not for Promises

**The Problem:** The NIH pays scientists for writing grant applications. This is like paying a chef for writing a menu instead of cooking a meal.

**The alternative:** Pay for results. Researchers get paid in two ways:

1.  **Per-patient funding:** The more patients who believe in your trial enough to join, the more funding you get.
2.  **Outcome Bounties:** Massive, multi-billion dollar prizes for solving the big problems (e.g., "$1 billion to the first team to reverse aging by 10 years").

In the NIH, you get rich by writing proposals. In a results-based system, you get rich by curing diseases.

### Rule 3: Make Corruption Mathematically Impossible

**The Problem:** Give billions of dollars to humans and they will find creative ways to steal it. This is not cynicism, this is pattern recognition.

**The alternative:** Replace humans with code. Code is very bad at embezzlement.

- **Algorithmic Governance:** All funding rules live in smart contracts. You can bribe a committee. You cannot bribe an if-statement.
- **No CEO:** There's no one to corrupt because there's no one. It's like trying to bribe a vending machine.
- **Public Ledger:** Every dollar is tracked on a blockchain anyone can read. It's radical transparency for an industry that has historically preferred opacity.

The goal isn't to rely on people being virtuous. It's to design incentives where good outcomes are also the easy outcomes. 

### Rule 4: Publish Everything (Especially the Failures)

**The Problem:** Companies and researchers hide their failed experiments. This means scientists around the world waste billions of dollars and decades of time repeating the same mistakes.

**The alternative:** Make 100% open publication of all data, positive and negative, a condition of funding.

- Every trial, every result, every dataset is published for the world to see.
- AI models continuously scan this global data commons, finding patterns and connections humans would miss.

This doubles research efficiency by preventing the same failure twice. It's like a group chat where everyone shares what didn't work, except the group is humanity and the topic is death prevention.

## The Core Innovation: Pay for Success

Every dollar flows based on results, not promises:

- **Patients vote with their enrollment** → Researchers get paid for attracting patients (market signal of efficacy)
- **Communities vote with their pools** → Bounties get paid for solving problems (not for proposing solutions)
- **No one gets paid for:**
  - Writing grant proposals
  - Attending review committees
  - Publishing papers about why their research might work someday

This is how most other industries work. You pay contractors when they build the house, not when they promise to build it. You pay farmers when they grow the food, not when they apply for a farming license.

The NIH pays for permission to do research. A results-based system pays for research that works.

**Single-sentence summary:** This is what you get when you pay scientists like you pay plumbers. i.e. for fixing the problem, not for explaining why it's hard.

## How the Money Flows: DIH as Decentralized Crowdfunding Platform

A decentralized institute of health functions as the **single governance layer** for all health research funding. Think of it as Kickstarter for clinical trials, except the stakes are higher and the rewards are measured in years of life.

### The Architecture

#### Your Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)

- Holds the treasury (from [1% treaty](1-percent-treaty.qmd))
- Handles ALL budgeting decisions via [Wishocracy](wishocracy.qmd)
- Funds campaigns, not bureaucracies
- No CEO, no board, no one to corrupt

**Your Decentralized Framework for Drug Assessment (dFDA)**

- Pure technical framework/protocol
- No budget authority (gets funded BY DIH like any other campaign)
- Just provides marketplace infrastructure
- One of many campaigns competing for DIH funding

### How It Actually Works

**1. Fill the Treasury**

A [1% treaty](1-percent-treaty.qmd) redirects **{{< var treaty_annual_funding >}}** a year from global military budgets into the DIH treasury.

**2. Anyone Can Propose a Campaign**

**3. Humanity Allocates via Wishocracy**

The global population uses [Wishocracy](wishocracy.qmd) to allocate funds across competing campaigns using pairwise comparisons:

- "What's more important: decentralized framework for drug assessment development"
- "What's more important: EHR integration or security audits?"

No committees. No lobbying. Just millions of pairwise preferences aggregated into funding allocations.

**4. Campaigns Compete for Funding**

- **Patient subsidies:** Automatically funded (formulaic, ~80% of treasury)
- **Infrastructure campaigns:** Multiple providers compete (dFDA platform, data storage, integrations)
- **Research prizes:** Bounties for specific breakthroughs
- **Public goods:** Market failures that need direct funding

**5. Results Determine Future Funding**

Campaigns that deliver impact get continued funding. Failures get defunded. It's venture capital, but for not dying.

### Why This Prevents Capture

{{< include ../figures/dih-vs-dfda-separation-diagram.qmd >}}

**Traditional centralized system:** Concentrated decision-making → lobbying targets

#### Decentralized alternative

- No director to bribe
- Millions vote via pairwise comparisons
- Open-source allocation algorithms
- Anyone can fork if captured
- Cost to corrupt: Prohibitively high

**Risk:** "What if the decentralized framework for drug assessment becomes the new FDA?"

**Mitigation:** A dFDA has no budget authority. It's just a campaign competing for DIH funding. If it gets captured, fund a competing framework instead.

## Projected Efficiency Gains

If the mechanism design works as intended, a decentralized institute of health could achieve significant efficiency improvements over the current system. The following projections are theoretical and depend on successful implementation.

### Projected Performance Metrics (Theoretical)

| Metric | NIH (Current) | DIH (Theoretical) | Potential Improvement |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Payment trigger** | Grant approved | Results achieved | Incentive alignment |
| **Cost per QALY** | [$50,000-$150,000](../references.qmd#qaly-value) | $5,000-$15,000 | ~10x reduction (theoretical) |
| **Overhead percentage** | [50-67%](../references.qmd#grant-writing-time-50pct) | <10% | ~6x reduction in overhead |
| **Time to treatment** | [10-17 years](../references.qmd#drug-development-timeline-17-years) | 2-4 years | ~4x faster (theoretical) |
| **Publication rate** | ~50% (positive results only) | 100% (all results) | 2x knowledge base |
| **Trials run annually** | ~5,000 major trials | 50,000-500,000 trials | 10-100x scale (theoretical) |
| **Researcher time on research** | 33-50% | >90% | ~2x productivity |

### How the Efficiency Gains Could Compound

If these improvements are achieved independently, they could multiply:

1. **~10x cost reduction** per QALY through elimination of overhead
2. **~2x knowledge multiplier** from mandatory publication of all results
3. **~4x speed multiplier** from cutting bureaucratic delays
4. **~10-100x scale** from distributed trial infrastructure ([dFDA](dfda.qmd))

**Theoretical ceiling (if everything works):** 10 × 2 × 4 × 10 = 800x improvement in QALY production rate

This is obviously a theoretical maximum. Real-world implementation would face friction, resistance, and unforeseen problems. But even achieving 10% of this improvement would represent a significant advance.

#### What This Could Mean in Practice

A well-functioning DIH, combined with the dFDA framework and operating on a 1% treaty budget of {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually, could theoretically produce more QALYs than the entire current global medical research output. 

If the theoretical efficiency gains are even partially realized, this could eventually lead to:

- Significantly improved cancer survival rates
- Aging research accelerated (whether "reversible" is another question)
- Rare diseases becoming economically viable to research
- Personalized medicine becoming more accessible

**The core hypothesis:** Systems that pay for results tend to produce more results than systems that pay for proposals. Whether this hypothesis holds for medical research at scale is what we're proposing to test.

That's the theory. The rest of this guide explains how you'd actually build it.
