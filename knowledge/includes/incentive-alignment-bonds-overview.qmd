**Legal Bribery That Isn't Technically Bribery**

Politicians don't optimize for "humans continuing to exist." They optimize for reelection, status, and post-office careers. You don't fix this with awareness campaigns. You fix it by changing what self-interest points at.

[Incentive Alignment Bonds (IABs)](/knowledge/solution/incentive-alignment-bonds.qmd) are financial instruments that make "support policies that save lives" and "advance your career" point in the same direction. No altruism required.

#### How It Works

Politicians are scored on their **voting record** for treaty funding - not health outcomes (which are global and can't be attributed to any country). When a politician votes YES on treaty funding:

- Their **Public Good Score** rises (based on public voting records - verifiable, ungameable)
- **Electoral support** increases (independent campaigns favor high-scorers)
- **Post-office opportunities** unlock (fellowships, advisory boards, speaking circuits)

No money flows to politicians. What flows is reputation, electoral advantage, and career advancement. The 10% political incentive fund is automatic - just math on treasury inflows, no oracle needed.

#### The Senator Smith Example

Senator Smith (R-Texas) is deciding how to vote on the 1% Treaty.

**Without IABs:**

| Vote Yes | Vote No |
|:---------|:--------|
| Attack ads: "Smith voted to WEAKEN AMERICA" | Safe from defense lobby attacks |
| Defense contractors fund opponent | Defense contractors fund you |
| Benefits arrive in 10 years | Costs arrive never |

Result: Vote no. Obviously.

**With IABs:**

| If Smith votes YES | If Smith votes NO |
|:-------------------|:------------------|
| Public Good Score: 45 → 72 | Score: 45 → 30 |
| P(reelection): 55% → 62% | P(reelection): 55% → 48% |
| $2M independent support | $2M goes to opponent |
| Post-office tier: 3 → 1 | Stuck at tier 3 |
| Expected post-office income: $200K → $500K/yr | Attack ads: "Smith voted AGAINST the cure" |

Result: Vote yes. The math changed.

#### VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds: IABs for the War on Disease

[VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds](/knowledge/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) are a specific Incentive Alignment Bond designed to fund and sustain the 1% treaty. They align multiple stakeholder types with a single instrument:

| Stakeholder | What They Get | Funding Source |
|:--|:--------------|:--------------------------|
| **Investors** | {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annual returns | {{< var victory_bond_funding_pct >}} of treaty revenue |
| **Politicians** | Reputation, electoral support, better careers | {{< var iab_political_incentive_funding_pct >}} of treaty revenue |
| **Patients** | Subsidized trial participation, cures | {{< var dih_treasury_medical_research_pct >}} of treaty revenue |

Investors fund the campaign ({{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}}). Politicians get career benefits for supporting it. Patients get cures. Everyone's self-interest points at the same outcome: pass the treaty, expand it, cure diseases.

#### Why This Isn't Bribery

1. **No one is paid to break a duty** - IABs reward compliance with duties (funding public health), not violating them
2. **Rules are universal and ex-ante** - Same rules for all politicians, announced publicly in advance
3. **No money goes to politicians** - They benefit indirectly through scores, electoral support, career options
4. **Scores based on public voting records** - No oracle needed, just verifiable votes from official government sources

Bribery corrupts alignment. IABs create alignment. You're not asking politicians to be better people. You're just making "fund pragmatic clinical trials" and "advance career" point in the same direction.

#### A General Governance Tool

The IAB architecture, with its scoring, electoral support, and post-office benefits, isn't specific to health. The same template works for any global coordination problem: climate change, nuclear disarmament, pandemic preparedness. The 1% Treaty is the proof of concept. If it works, the mechanism becomes available for every problem where humanity's long-term survival depends on politicians doing the right thing.
