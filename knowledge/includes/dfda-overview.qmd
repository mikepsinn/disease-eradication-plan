**Amazon for Clinical Trials + Consumer Reports for Drugs**

[Your decentralized framework for drug assessment (dFDA)](/knowledge/solution/dfda.qmd) achieves **{{< var trial_cost_reduction_factor >}}x cost reduction** through decentralized pragmatic trials.
Patients can search treatments ranked by real-world effectiveness and join trials with one click.

#### Safer Than the FDA

**Current FDA system:**

- Adverse events require filling out a PDF form (seriously)
- Most side effects never get reported
- No public database of outcome frequencies
- You find out a drug causes heart attacks 10 years later when lawyers get involved

**A decentralized assessment system:**

- Adverse events collected automatically from every participant
- Real-time reporting to everyone (not buried in FDA databases)
- Outcome labels show exact frequency and severity of every effect
- You know the risks BEFORE you take the drug, not after the class action lawsuit

The FDA doesn't even publish adverse event rates. They make you guess. The framework tells you "12% of patients got headaches, 3% were severe, 0.1% discontinued treatment." That's not less safe than the current system. That's actually having safety data.

#### Treatment Rankings

Consumer Reports for Drugs

**Current system:** Your doctor picks treatments based on:

- That drug rep who brought good donuts in 2003
- Something they half-remember from medical school
- Whatever the insurance company allows
- Vibes

[A decentralized framework for drug assessment](/knowledge/solution/dfda.qmd): Type your condition, see every [treatment ranked by real-world effectiveness](/knowledge/solution/dfda.qmd):

![Treatment Rankings Example](/assets/dfda-comparative-effectiveness-ranking-search.png)

Rankings are based on frequency and magnitude of health outcome changes across all patients - or filtered to patients with similar omic profiles to yours. A treatment that works great for 25-year-old women with your genetic variants might not work for 60-year-old men with different variants. The framework shows you what works for people like you, not average effects across everyone.

##### Outcome Labels

*Nutrition Facts for Drugs*

Food has nutrition labels.
Cigarettes have warning labels.
Drugs have... incomprehensible 40-page inserts written by lawyers having seizures.

[Your decentralized framework for drug assessment](/knowledge/solution/dfda.qmd) fixes that with **[Outcome Labels](/knowledge/solution/dfda.qmd)** - simple, data-driven summaries showing exactly what happens when real people try a treatment:

![Outcome Labels Example](/assets/dfda-outcome-labels.png)

Based on thousands of real patients, you see:

- **Cognitive Improvements**: Memory +35%, Executive Function +22%
- **Side Effects**: Headache +9% (mild), Fatigue +7% (moderate)
- **Discontinuation rate**: 2.3% stopped due to side effects
- **The Truth**: Not marketing claims, actual measured effects from real humans

No more pharmaceutical fan fiction.
No more lawyers writing medical advice during fever dreams.
Just cold, hard data about whether this chemical makes your meat work better or worse.
