You've seen the problem (humans are bad at priorities) and the solution (trick them into fixing it). Now for the interesting part: the exact sequence of bribes.

This isn't "raising awareness." Awareness doesn't cure diseases. Papers do. Specifically, [$1.0B in papers](../economics/campaign-budget.qmd) distributed in the correct order to the correct humans.

## The Paper Collection Timeline: From $0 to Ending Death

You want to end war and disease. You need $1.0B in papers. You currently have $0 in papers (probably). Here's the recipe.

1.  **Phase 1: Proof That Clicking Works (Months 1-3).** You build a simple version of **[Wishocracy](../solution/wishocracy.qmd)** - basically a website where humans click "yes" to not dying. If anyone uses it, you've proven humans will vote for things when bribed with imaginary points. You show this to angel investors who understand that betting small papers to get infinite papers is mathematically obvious.
2.  **Phase 2: Scale the Clicking, Hire Professional Bribers (Months 4-18).** With proof that humans will click buttons when offered money, you raise more papers from venture capitalists (humans who gamble professionally while wearing suits). You use these papers to scale the referendum to millions of clickers and hire your first professional lobbyists - humans whose actual job is "convince politicians that things are good."
3.  **Phase 3: The Big Paper Sale (Months 19-36).** This is the final boss level. You launch **[VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**, which are like war bonds except backwards - you're giving papers to humans to STOP making corpses instead of START making corpses. This raises the full $1.0B you need to overwhelm the opposition, run a global "please don't die" advertising campaign, and get the **[1% treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** signed by actual governments who thought weapons were the only option.

> **Feasibility Check:** While the full plan costs $1B to guarantee success, the diplomatic phase alone (getting the treaty signed) historically costs only **$90M**. We raise $1B to make it inevitable, but "Treaty-Ready" status is much cheaper. See [Treaty Feasibility & Cost Analysis](../appendix/treaty-feasibility.qmd).

## The Legal Architecture: How to Be a Charity, a Lobbying Group, and a Hedge Fund Simultaneously

To win, you need to fight on three fronts: moral (charity), political (lobbying), and financial (investment). The problem is your legal system says one organization can't do all three.

Your legal system is adorably complicated, like a board game designed by lawyers having a nightmare.

So you build a four-part machine:

- **The Charity (501c3):** This is the "brains." It does research and education. This is where rich foundations give papers and get to feel good about themselves (plus tax deductions, which are like discount coupons for virtue).
- **The Lobbying Group (501c4):** This is the "sword." It takes the research and uses it to wage unlimited political warfare, which sounds scary but mostly involves lunch meetings and PowerPoints.
- **The Corporation (C-Corp):** This is the "engine." A for-profit entity that issues the VICTORY [Incentive Alignment Bonds](../appendix/incentive-alignment-bonds-paper.qmd) and collects the papers. Yes, you need a for-profit corporation to end death. Your species is hilarious.
- **The Swiss Foundation:** This is the "soul." The parent organization that owns the corporation, ensuring profits can only be used for the mission. You put it in Switzerland because they're good at keeping things neutral and also chocolate.

This structure lets you legally accept papers from everyone - foundations, political donors, and Wall Street - and aim them all at diseases instead of each other.

## The Political Strategy: Co-Opt, Don't Compete

You cannot outspend the military-industrial complex in a head-to-head fight. They have more papers than countries.

So you don't fight them. You bribe them.

The strategy is simple: make it more profitable for everyone - defense contractors, politicians, insurance companies - to support the treaty than to oppose it. You're not fighting greed. You're redirecting it, like a judo move but with capitalism.

You use the $1.0B from the VICTORY [Incentive Alignment Bonds](../appendix/incentive-alignment-bonds-paper.qmd) to offer everyone a better deal:

- Defense contractors keep 99% of their murder budget PLUS get {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns on bonds
- Politicians get campaign funding AND 280 million voters who want to not die
- Insurance companies realize healthy people file fewer death claims

Suddenly their lobbyists become your lobbyists. Their political action committees start making action for not-dying instead of dying. It's beautiful. Like watching a dog realize the mailman has treats.

You combine this with overwhelming public pressure from [280 million verified voters](global-referendum.qmd) in the global referendum. The choice for politicians becomes mathematically simple: side with the public and get papers, or side with the status quo and get unemployed.

Politicians are simple organisms with one evolutionary drive: reelection. You're just making that drive align with not killing everyone.

## Your Next Steps

You now know the exact sequence:

1. **Build the legal machine:** [The four-part structure](../legal/legal-framework.qmd) that lets you collect papers from everyone simultaneously
2. **Sell the bonds:** [VICTORY Incentive Alignment Bonds](../economics/victory-bonds.qmd) that offer {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns to humans who prefer not dying
3. **Run the vote:** [The global referendum](global-referendum.qmd) where 280 million humans click "yes" to not dying
4. **Start now:** [Three things you can do](../call-to-action/three-actions.qmd) in the next three minutes instead of scrolling

It's not complicated. You're just bribing everyone in the correct order with the correct amounts.

Like a recipe, except instead of making bread, you're ending war and disease. And instead of yeast, it's greed.

## Phase 4+: The Expansion Phases (Years 4-50)

The 1% treaty is just the beginning. The real goal is eventually redirecting *most* military spending to health.

### Why Expansion Is Built Into The System

The [80/10/10 funding allocation](../solution/incentive-alignment-bonds.qmd#sec-why-ten-pct-scaling-engine) includes {{< var iab_political_incentive_funding_pct >}} for political incentives via [Incentive Alignment Bonds](../solution/incentive-alignment-bonds.qmd). This isn't a fixed cost - it's a **scaling engine**.

As treaty percentage increases, IAB funding scales proportionally:

| Phase | Year | Treaty % | Political Incentive Pool | What Happens |
|:------|:-----|:---------|:------------------------|:-------------|
| 3 | 1-3 | 1% | $2.7B/year | Treaty passes, cures begin |
| 4 | 4-7 | 2% | $5.4B/year | Politicians compete to expand |
| 5 | 8-12 | 5% | $13.5B/year | Defense lobby can't compete |
| 6 | 13-20 | 10% | $27B/year | War becomes economically obsolete |
| 7 | 21-35 | 25% | $67.5B/year | Superpowers compete on health outcomes |
| 8 | 36-50 | 50%+ | $135B+/year | Full transformation |

### The Key Insight

**VICTORY Bond investors** are satisfied at 1%. They get their {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns regardless of expansion.

**Politicians** see their [IAB-funded rewards](../solution/incentive-alignment-bonds.qmd) grow with each expansion. By Phase 6, the political incentive pool ($27B/year) exceeds all current global lobbying combined. "Support health spending" becomes the single most rewarded political position on Earth.

### The Endgame

By 2075, the math becomes irresistible:

- $1.35+ trillion flows to health annually
- $135+ billion funds political incentives (more than all lobbying ever)
- $1.08+ trillion funds pragmatic clinical trials
- War is economically obsolete

The 1% treaty isn't the goal. It's the proof of concept. The IAB mechanism ensures the system keeps ratcheting upward until military spending is a historical curiosity, like jousting or the telegraph.
