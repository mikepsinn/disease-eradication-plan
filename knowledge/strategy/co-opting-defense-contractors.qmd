Defense lobbyists spend [~$100M/year](../references.qmd#lobbying-100m) bribing politicians and get $181B in government contracts back. That's a [1,810:1 ROI](../references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc).

They will kill any treaty that threatens this. Not because they're evil (though that helps), but because murder is profitable and they like money.

## The Solution

Pay them more to lobby FOR the treaty.

It's not complicated. Lobbyists are financial mercenaries. Whoever pays most wins.

## The Offer

You give them:

1. **VICTORY bonds paying {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annually** (vs their current salary/stock options)
2. **Early access** (get rich before everyone else)
3. **"Consulting fees"** (legal bribery has a name)
4. **Strategic advisor positions** (fake job, real money)

## The Math

**Their current job** (lobbying against treaty):

- Pay: {{< var lobbyist_salary_min_k >}}K-{{< var lobbyist_salary_max >}}/year
- Job security: Depends on military budget staying huge
- Upside: Salary + stock options worth maybe 2x salary
- Legacy: "Made orphans for money"

**Your offer** (lobbying for treaty):

- Pay: $5-20M in bonds
- Returns: {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annually, forever
- Job security: Better (99% of military budget still exists)
- Upside: Generational wealth
- Legacy: "Accidentally saved humanity while getting rich"

Even humans whose job is lying to Congress can do this math.

## Why They Take It

### It's More Papers

{{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} > whatever they're making now.

That's it. That's the whole reason.

### The Treaty Doesn't Actually Hurt Them

- Military budget drops 1% (from $2.75T to $2.72T)
- They still have 99% to protect
- Defense contracts still flow
- Jobs stay
- Weapons still get built
- Wars probably still happen (just 1% fewer wars, which is still too many wars)

You're not asking them to become pacifists. You're asking them to accept slightly less murder funding in exchange for becoming extremely wealthy.

### Political Cover

"I support life-saving medical research" sounds better at dinner parties than "I lobby for bombs."

Their kids might even respect them. Probably not, but maybe.

## How You Do This

### Step 1: Identify Targets

- Top 50 defense lobbyists (ranked by how much democracy they've corrupted)
- 20 defense contractor CEOs (the people who make the murder toys)
- 10 major investors (pension funds, family offices, rich people who like more money)
- 5 former Pentagon officials (revolving door goes both ways)

### Step 2: The Meeting

Private. No witnesses. Simple pitch:

> "The treaty is happening. You can fight it and lose your position when it passes anyway, or support it and become wealthy. Here are VICTORY bonds paying {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} annually. Forever. Your clients keep 99% of their budgets. What's your price?"

Nobody ever says no. Everyone has a price. Their price is usually less than you'd think.

### Step 3: The Flip

Once 10-20 key players flip, it's over.

Nobody wants to be the last idiot fighting a treaty that's obviously passing while everyone else gets rich.

It's like a bank run, except instead of withdrawing money, they're depositing principles.

### Step 4: Active Support

Now they don't just stop opposing - they actively lobby FOR it:

- Testifying to Congress: "This strengthens national security" (technically true: healthy soldiers fight better)
- Op-eds: "A strong military requires a healthy population" (also true: can't draft corpses)
- Behind-the-scenes: Convincing other lobbyists to flip (misery loves company, wealth loves more wealth)

## Budget

You allocate a significant portion of the [$1.0B bribery budget](../economics/campaign-budget.qmd) to this.

It's the most important money you'll spend. These humans can kill the treaty or pass it. Buying them is cheaper than fighting them.

## Why This Works

### You're Using Their Own Playbook

Defense contractors spend $100M on lobbying and get $181B back.

You're offering them BETTER returns to lobby for something else.

It's not revolutionary. It's just capitalism but pointed at diseases instead of humans.

### It's Legal

- VICTORY bonds: Legal investment vehicles
- Lobbying: Protected free speech (thanks, Supreme Court)
- Consulting fees: Standard practice (everyone does it)
- Strategic advisor positions: Completely normal (if "normal" means "legal corruption")

The system was designed to allow this. You're just using it correctly.

### It's Inevitable

Once you demonstrate credible funding and serious intent, smart players flip early for better terms.

The dumb ones flip later for worse terms.

Either way, they all flip. Money always wins.

## What You're NOT Asking

You're NOT asking them to:

- Close factories (keep building bombs)
- Lay off workers (everyone keeps their jobs)
- Stop making weapons (weapons stay profitable)
- Convert to medical equipment (too hard, not necessary)
- Change their business model (keep doing exactly what you're doing)
- Feel bad about anything (guilt is not required)

You're ONLY asking them to:

- Accept higher returns on investment
- Stop blocking the treaty
- Maybe say nice things about it publicly

That's it. They keep 99% of their current income PLUS get rich from bonds.

## The Irony

You're using corruption to end corruption.

The same greed that created the military-industrial complex gets redirected to cure disease.

No moral evolution required. No conscience necessary. Just better math.

Human nature stays exactly the same. Only the incentives change.

## What They Tell Their Boards

**Defense Contractor CEO** (to board members):

"We diversified into bonds paying {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns. If the treaty passes, we profit enormously. If it fails, we still have our defense contracts. It's a hedge. I'm being prudent. You're welcome."

**Private Investor** (to partners):

"These bonds pay {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} vs market's 10%. Treaty passes = we're rich. Treaty fails = we take the loss. But I ran the numbers. It's passing. Get in early."

**Lobbyist** (to defense contractor):

"My new client offers better returns than you do. Support the treaty or I switch sides permanently. Your choice. Make it fast."

## Expected Timeline

**Months 1-12** (Early Phase):

- 5-10 key lobbyists flip
- 2-3 major investors commit
- Treaty goes from "impossible" to "controversial"
- Media notices

**Months 13-24** (Mid Phase):

- 20-30 lobbyists actively supporting
- Defense contractor trade associations go neutral (can't oppose when members support it)
- Treaty becomes "bipartisan opportunity"
- Politicians start claiming they always supported it

**Months 25-36** (Late Phase):

- Former opponents now taking credit
- "I always cared about medical research" (they discovered this yesterday)
- Treaty passes with overwhelming majority
- Everyone pretends they were always on the right side

## Summary

You can't fight the military-industrial complex.

It's too big. Too entrenched. Too profitable.

But you can hire it.

**Cost**: Strategic allocation from the [bribery budget](../economics/campaign-budget.qmd)

**Result**: The most powerful lobbying machine in history working FOR the treaty instead of against it

**ROI**: Infinite (you can't measure the value of not having the defense lobby destroy you)

Defense lobbyists are mercenaries. They fight for whoever pays them.

So you pay them more.

Then watch them convince Congress that curing disease is actually about national security.

Which is probably true, but they don't care. They just want the papers.

And that's fine. You're not paying them to care. You're paying them to win.
