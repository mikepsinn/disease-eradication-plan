# Stop Fighting Over Scraps, Grow the Global Pie

Most nonprofits are trapped in a **zero-sum game**.

They behave like starving dogs fighting over a single bowl of food while an entire banquet sits untouched behind them.

Every grant you win is a grant another organization loses. Every dollar you secure for malaria is a dollar not spent on Alzheimer’s. Every donor you convince is a donor distracted from climate change.

In a fixed-pie system, your success requires someone else's failure. You might be doing "as much or more good" than the other guy, but collectively, you aren't solving the scarcity problem. You're just reshuffling it.

Meanwhile, the real driver of scarcity, the real reason the bowl is so small, is ignored:

**Humanity spends orders of magnitude more on war, weapons, and military build-up than on solving the problems that actually kill or impoverish civilians.**

This is not an ideological claim. It is an accounting identity.

Every year:

* Military spending ≈ [**$2.4 trillion**](../references.qmd#global-military-spending-2-44t) (actually closer to $2.7T now, but who's counting?)
* Global spending on curing disease (NIH equivalents, WHO grants, biomedical R&D, public health) ≈ [**$70–90 billion**](../references.qmd#global-gov-med-research-spending)
* Military budgets are rising by hundreds of billions annually.
* NIH and equivalent biomedical budgets are facing [**real-term cuts**](../references.qmd#nih-funding-cuts-brain-drain).

The resource pie for solving disease, climate, poverty, and suffering is shrinking.

The pie for building weapons is expanding.

You cannot solve a resource allocation crisis by optimizing inside the smallest slice.

You must expand the pie. This turns a **zero-sum game** into a **positive-sum game**.

This is the logic behind the **[1% Treaty](../solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)**.

## The Single Most Impactful Thing Any Mission-Driven Organization Can Do

If your mission is:

* curing Alzheimer’s
* preventing cancer
* mitigating climate change
* slowing pandemics
* ending extreme poverty
* protecting democracy
* reducing existential risk
* improving education
* promoting peace
* stabilizing the biosphere

…the single highest-ROI intervention available is:

**Redirecting 1% of global military budgets toward ultra-efficient, pragmatic R&D that improves health, wealth, resilience, and stability.**

Why?

Because:

1. **Every dollar spent on war is a dollar not spent on life.**
2. **Every dollar moved from military to human progress has a 10–200× higher welfare multiplier.**
3. **Redirecting the *flow* of resources changes the future more than any single program.**
4. **A healthier, wealthier, more stable world reduces every global problem simultaneously.**

War is upstream of poverty.

War is upstream of pollution.
War is upstream of refugee crises.
War is upstream of authoritarianism.
War is upstream of disease spread.
War is upstream of technological stagnation.
War is upstream of climate destruction (militaries are among the largest polluters on Earth).

Reduce war by 1%, and every downstream mission gets easier.

Increase war by 1%, and every mission becomes almost impossible.

The 1% Treaty is not a peace movement.
It is a **resource-alignment movement**.

## “But Shouldn’t Nonprofits Focus on Their Core Mission?”

Yes, and that's exactly why they should support the 1% Treaty.

Every nonprofit today is operating inside a system that guarantees scarcity:

* too few grant dollars
* too much competition
* too much fragmentation
* political headwinds
* donor fatigue
* shrinking government budgets for health, climate, and poverty
* ballooning budgets for war

Most nonprofits are fighting each other for scraps of a shrinking pie.

If your mission matters, this is suicidal.

A small increase in resources within your field often leads to small, incremental improvements. More staff. More grants. More programs.

A small increase in military budgets leads to arms races, instability, and the destruction of progress you spent decades building.

If your organization does not help shift the resource flow, your future funding and impact will be determined by someone else.

Supporting the 1% Treaty is not a distraction. **It is strategic self-preservation.**

## The Zero-Sum Trap vs. The Positive-Sum Solution

**The Zero-Sum Game (Status Quo):**
*   You fight for a $100,000 grant.
*   If you win, the malaria charity loses.
*   Total global impact is capped by the fixed size of the philanthropy bucket.
*   You spend 40% of your time writing proposals instead of saving lives.

**The Positive-Sum Game (1% Treaty):**
*   We work together to pass the treaty.
*   The "philanthropy bucket" grows by **$24 billion/year** (initially) and scales up.
*   **Everyone gets funded.**
*   Malaria gets cured AND Alzheimer’s gets cured.
*   You stop writing proposals and start governing the treasury.

## "Why Now?" Because the Window Is Open

For the first time in 80 years:

* the public is angry about rising military budgets
* trust in government spending priorities is collapsing
* medical breakthroughs feel within reach but unrealized
* climate disasters have shifted public opinion
* pandemics exposed the cost of underfunding resilience
* AI and biotech make accelerated progress possible
* leaders are searching for high-leverage, unifying narratives

You cannot pass a resource-reallocation treaty when people feel safe, rich, and complacent.

You can pass it when budgets are being cut, militaries are expanding, and people feel the system is misaligned.

This is the moment.

If nonprofits do not push now, the window closes. And when it closes, every mission becomes harder for decades.

## Historical Precedent: Wartime Mobilization Proves This Works

During World War II:

* The U.S. converted car factories into bomber factories.
* GM built tanks.
* Ford built B-24s.
* Frigidaire produced machine guns.
* Typewriter manufacturers made rifles.

Not because they “supported war.” But because **the system needed realignment** and ignoring it was impossible.

Today, the world needs the opposite realignment:

* Less production of weapons
* More production of cures, resilience, stability, and health

The global nonprofit sector is the modern equivalent of those car factories: Massive capacity, talented people, and the wrong pie allocation.

A few years of effort to shift 1% of global budgets could produce more impact than **30 years** of incremental programs.

## “Why Not Just Run Decentralized Trials Ourselves?”

You should.

But decentralized trials alone do not solve the lack of global funding or the political economy of war.

This is the key insight:

**Decentralized trials scale infinitely better when the resource stream feeding them is 10–40× larger.**

If you build the most efficient trial system in the world but the budget for clinical progress is shrinking, you still lose. You cannot out-optimize a broken budget. You must change the resource flow itself.

## The 1% Treaty Is a Rising Tide That Lifts Every Mission

What happens if the world shifts just **1%** of military budgets?

Outcomes across fields:

### **Health**
* 25× more clinical trial capacity
* 100× faster therapeutic discovery
* lower costs per cure

### **Climate**
* lower military emissions
* fewer resource-driven conflicts
* more funds for climate solutions

### **Poverty**
* trillions in long-term economic productivity
* fewer war-displaced refugees
* more government revenue for social services

### **Global Stability**
* less chance of great-power conflict
* more international cooperation on existential risks

### **Nonprofit Impact**
* everyone stops competing for crumbs
* every mission receives more oxygen
* funders far more willing to invest

A 1% move unlocks 100% more possibility.

## The Moral Argument Is Simple

**War shrinks every future. Health enlarges every future.**

Every dollar spent on war destroys life, pollutes the biosphere, undermines stability, and reduces wealth.

Every dollar spent on health increases life, reduces suffering, improves productivity, and stabilizes democracies.

This is the easiest moral tradeoff in the history of civilization.

## Why Nonprofits Must Prioritize the 1% Treaty in the Short Term

Because nothing else increases their impact, funding, and security more.

Every nonprofit wants to cure something, save something, protect something, or improve something. Every one of those missions is downstream of resource allocation.

The 1% Treaty is upstream of everything.

## The Ask Is Small, The Upside Is Massive

We are not asking for global disarmament or naive pacifism.

We are asking for **1%**.

One penny of each tax dollar currently used to build weapons. One small shift in a $2.4 trillion flow.

But that single percentage point:

* creates a $24 billion/year DIH treasury
* funds global decentralized clinical trials
* makes every nonprofit’s mission 10× more feasible

It is the highest-leverage bargain available to humanity.

## The Bottom Line

If you care about your mission, you must care about the 1% Treaty.

You cannot solve your mission inside a shrinking, war-distorted budget environment. You cannot optimize your way out of a fundamental resource mismatch.

The smartest thing the nonprofit sector can do right now is:

**Stop fighting over scraps.**
**Stop playing a zero-sum game.**
**Grow the pie.**
**Pass the 1% Treaty.**
**Then return to your mission with 10–40× greater resources.**

This is not idealism. This is strategy.

A few years of coordinated advocacy for the 1% Treaty will unlock more impact across every field than decades of incrementalism.

This is the moment to act.
