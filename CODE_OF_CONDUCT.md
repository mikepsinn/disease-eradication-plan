# Code of Conduct

Our mission is to end war and disease. This requires a specific culture. These are the rules for that culture.

## The Rules

1.  **Protect the Person, Attack the Idea.**
    We need fierce debate to find the truth. But for debate to be honest, it must be safe. Create an environment where people feel safe to be wrong, to ask stupid questions, and to propose crazy ideas. Do not attack or humiliate people. The mission depends on trust.

2.  **Focus on the Mission.**
    Our only enemy is war and disease. We are a single-issue coalition. Do not create friction over unrelated issues.

3.  **Default to Action.**
    The plan is imperfect. We learn by doing. Do not wait for permission. Have a bias for action over endless discussion. Inaction is a decision, and it is usually the wrong one.

4.  **Ideas Over Influence.**
    In discussions, the quality of an idea is all that matters, not the wealth or status of the person who shared it.

5.  **Share Knowledge.**
    If you are the only person who knows something, you are a single point of failure. Document what you do. Make the project resilient.

6.  **Create Momentum.**
    Big goals are achieved through small, consistent wins. Break down impossible tasks into achievable steps. Celebrate progress. Momentum is the fuel for long-term missions.

7.  **See a Problem, Own the Problem.**
    If you see a major flaw, don't just point it out—start organizing the solution. Silence is complicity, but complaining without action is just noise.
