# Roadmap

> Note: The canonical high-level plan is maintained here: [Canonical Roadmap — 1% Treaty → DIH → dFDA](../roadmap.md). This page is an older, DAO-focused roadmap retained for historical context and tactical details.

For the end‑to‑end plan, see the [Canonical Roadmap — 1% Treaty → DIH → dFDA](../roadmap.md).

So, roughly the process would be:
👉 $1M to initially create the DAO
👉 $40M from token crowdfunding
👉 $20M Lobbying + $20M Marketing to Get Signatures from 1%
👉 $20B/year funding
👉 If necessary, pay back initial contributors, with 0.5% of the $20B
👉 260X Faster Medical Progress and 1% Less War
👉 [$179T](1-percent-treaty.md) Equivalent Economic Value of Less War and Disease
