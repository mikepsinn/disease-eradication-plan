# The Decentralized Institutes of Health: A Treasury for the War on Disease

The Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH) is reimagined as a global treasury dedicated to financing a revolution in medical research. Its core mission is to fund the dFDA ecosystem by providing patient subsidies, financing infrastructure development, and incentivizing innovation through bounties and prizes.

The DIH operates not as a research body itself, but as the central financial engine that makes the dFDA's mission possible, breaking down the economic barriers that have slowed the war on disease for decades.

## Primary Mission: Subsidizing Patient Access to Trials

The cornerstone of the DIH's mission is to ensure that no patient is denied access to a promising trial due to cost. The DIH acts as the source of patient subsidies for participation in all trials on the dFDA Platform.

Subsidies are not allocated uniformly; they are **proportional to the expected value to society** of a patient's participation. This creates a powerful incentive for researchers to focus on high-impact projects. The algorithm for calculating subsidies prioritizes trials based on a combination of factors:

1.  **Promise of the Treatment:** Interventions with strong preclinical data or a novel mechanism of action receive higher subsidies.
2.  **Severity of the Disease:** Trials for conditions with high mortality, disability, or societal cost are prioritized.
3.  **Value of the Data:** Trials that can resolve high levels of uncertainty (i.e., where very little data currently exists) are considered more valuable.
4.  **Cost of Manufacturing:** Lower-cost interventions (e.g., repurposed drugs, supplements) can be subsidized more heavily, allowing more patients to participate.

This model ensures that funding flows to the research that society needs most.

## Funding the dFDA Ecosystem

Beyond patient subsidies, the DIH Treasury is responsible for the growth and maintenance of the entire dFDA ecosystem. It achieves this through a DAO-governed funding model for:

*   **Prizes & Competitions:** Funding major awards like the FDA-X Prize to incentivize breakthrough innovation from the global community.
*   **Development Bounties:** Posting and paying out bounties for specific feature enhancements, bug fixes, and security improvements to the dFDA Platform's open-source codebase.
*   **Infrastructure Maintenance:** Ensuring the long-term sustainability, security, and scalability of the dFDA Platform as a global public good.

## Funding Model: $VICTORY Bonds for the War on Disease

To raise its initial and ongoing capital, the DIH will issue **`$VICTORY` Bonds**, an instrument modeled directly on the War Bonds of World War II. See tokenomics details in [\$VICTORY Instruments](./victory-bonds-tokenomics.md).

Just as citizens once invested in their nation's victory in wartime, they can now invest directly in the victory over humanity's oldest enemies: cancer, Alzheimer's, heart disease, and thousands of other afflictions. Selling these bonds allows the DIH to raise a substantial treasury upfront, enabling it to immediately begin funding subsidies and development without waiting for treaty contributions to accumulate.

## Repayment & Sustainability: The 1% Treaty

The financial model is made sustainable through the **[1% Treaty](1-percent-treaty.md)**. The capital contributions made by signatory nations who pledge 1% of their military budgets are used to repay the `$VICTORY` Bond holders over time, with interest.

This creates a virtuous cycle:
1.  Citizens and institutions buy `$VICTORY` Bonds, funding the war on disease.
2.  The DIH uses this capital to fund trials and development, producing cures and better health outcomes.
3.  Nations, seeing the immense benefit, sign the 1% Treaty.
4.  Treaty contributions flow back to the DIH Treasury, repaying the original bondholders.

## Governance: Automated-by-default, DAO as emergency override

Subsidy allocation and most treasury functions execute via smart contracts with verifiable inputs (oracles) and transparent rules. Stakeholders participate through credentialed, timeboxed signaling; on-chain executors apply changes automatically. A narrowly scoped, time-limited DAO acts as an emergency override with public justification and automatic sunset. For custody and controls, see [DIH Treasury Architecture](../../features/treasury/dih-treasury-architecture.md).

## Risks and Realism
The DIH model's success relies on treaty adoption and inflows. For a full discussion of risks, repayment, and contingencies, see [Victory Bond Investment Thesis](../../economic-models/victory-bond-investment-thesis.md#10-assessing-realism-risks-repayment-timeline-and-contingencies).

## Organizational Structure

The DIH is expanding into a comprehensive ecosystem that mirrors the NIH structure while offering decentralized governance,  titles, and community-specific focus areas. This expansion serves as a strategic recruitment tool for the 1% Treaty referendum effort.
