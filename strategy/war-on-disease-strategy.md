# The War on Disease: A Strategy Engineered from History

> Note: For the current plan and execution sequence, see the canonical documents: [War on Disease — Landing](./warondisease-landing.md) and [Canonical Roadmap — 1% Treaty → DIH → dFDA](./roadmap.md).

## 1. The Unacceptable Reality: A Grotesque Misallocation

Humanity allocates **$2.72 trillion** annually to military spending and just **$67.5 billion** to medical research—a 40:1 disparity. For centuries, moral arguments, peace movements, and protests have failed to make a meaningful impact on this grotesque misallocation of our collective resources.

The core problem is that the system is not broken; it is working perfectly for the powerful financial and political interests that profit from it. To change the outcome, we must change the incentives.

## 2. The Core Thesis: You Cannot Defeat Bad Money with Good Intentions

The single most important lesson comes from the failure of past movements like the **Nuclear Disarmament ("Freeze") Movement** of the 1980s. Despite massive global support, it failed because it relied on moral persuasion against an entrenched military-industrial complex with billions of dollars at stake.

**Our strategy is engineered to correct this fundamental flaw.** We will not defeat bad money with morals; we will make curing people more profitable than killing them. Our core thesis is to make peace and healing more profitable for the powerful than conflict and destruction.

This is not a traditional activist movement. It is a **financially-powered political arbitrage play** to redirect a massive, pre-existing cash flow.

## 3. The Strategic Blueprint: A Synthesis of Proven Models

Our strategy is a deliberate synthesis of historical lessons, combining models that have worked with solutions engineered to avoid the failure modes of the past.

### Step 1: Mobilize Global Will via a Citizen-led Referendum
*   **The Precedent (Success):** The **International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL)** proved that a decentralized, global coalition can create binding international law (the 1997 Ottawa Treaty) in the face of initial opposition from military powers.
*   **Our Action:** We will launch a global referendum on the **"1% Treaty."** This is our single, laser-focused policy objective, avoiding the trap of diffuse goals that weakened movements like **Occupy Wall Street**. The goal is to reach the **3.5% Tipping Point** of global participation, a threshold that has historically preceded major political change.

### Step 2: Fund the Movement with a Public Financial Instrument
*   **The Precedent (Success):** **World War II War Bonds** proved that you can mobilize massive private capital for a public cause by masterfully blending moral purpose with financial self-interest.
*   **Our Action:** We will issue **VICTORY instruments** (VICTORY Bonds and Tokens) to finance the entire operation. This allows anyone on Earth to invest directly in the success of the mission, transforming them from passive supporters into active owners.

### Step 3: Co-Opt the Opposition with Superior Financial Incentives
*   **The Precedent (Failure):** The Nuclear Freeze movement.
*   **The Precedent (Success):** The financial engineering of **Michael Milken (High-Yield Bonds)** and the political arbitrage of **George Soros (betting against the Pound)**.
*   **Our Action:** We will use the capital raised to **co-opt the military-industrial complex**, not fight it. We will structure our financial offerings to provide a mathematically superior risk-adjusted return compared to their existing investments. We will make it more profitable for defense contractors, their investors, and their lobbyists to support the treaty than to oppose it. See our full analysis at [Co-Opting Defense Contractors](./co-opting-defense-contractors.md).

### Step 4: Create a New, More Efficient Institution
*   **The Precedent (Success):** **The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria** proved that the world can create new, multi-billion-dollar global health institutions when the existing ones are insufficient.
*   **Our Action:** Upon treaty ratification, the redirected funds will flow into the **Decentraled Institutes of Health (DIH)**, a transparent, democratically controlled, and radically more efficient institution for funding global health research and patient care.
    *   **The 80X Efficiency Engine:** The DIH will not simply fund the existing, broken research model. It will exclusively support a **decentralized FDA (dFDA)** platform that enables hyper-efficient pragmatic trials. This model, based on precedents like the Oxford RECOVERY trial, reduces per-patient costs from **$41,000 to as low as $500**—an **80X efficiency gain**. This radical efficiency is not just a theoretical improvement; it unlocks staggering value:
        *   **463:1 Return on Investment:** The platform is projected to save the global R&D industry **~$50 billion annually** on a modest operational cost, making it a profoundly valuable infrastructure investment.
        *   **840,000+ Life-Years Annually:** The combination of faster drug access, better prevention, and new therapies for neglected diseases is projected to generate over 840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) each year.
        *   **A Dominant Health Intervention:** The dFDA is a rare "dominant" intervention—it simultaneously saves vast sums of money *and* improves health outcomes.
    *   This radical efficiency is what ensures the redirected funds will have a transformative impact on global health. For a full breakdown, see the [dFDA Cost Benefit Analysis](../economic-models/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.md).

## 4. The Economic Engine: Capturing the First Peace Dividend

The financial power of this model is built on a simple principle: capturing the first, tangible portion of the massive economic value unlocked by reducing global conflict.

*   **The Inefficiency:** The world suffers from a **$16.5 trillion annual "Cost of Violence,"** a massive economic burden that represents the single largest pool of misallocated capital on the planet.
*   **The Captured Dividend:** The **$27 billion annual cash flow** we redirect. This is the tangible revenue stream that provides the fundamental backing for our financial instruments.
*   **The Societal Dividend:** By reducing global conflict drivers by 1%, the intervention unlocks a far greater economic prize for the world. A 1% reduction of the $16.5T Cost of Violence equates to **$165 billion in annual economic value** returned to society through increased stability, productivity, and growth.

Our model captures the first $27B to unlock the full $165B for everyone. This vast societal return is what makes the mission so compelling and the governance rights conferred by VICTORY bonds exceptionally valuable. For a detailed breakdown, see [The Peace Dividend: Value Capture & Distribution Model](../economic-models/peace-dividend-value-capture.md).

## 5. Mitigating Risk: Learning from Financial Failures

Our investment terms are engineered to avoid the catastrophic failures of the past.
*   **The Precedent (Failure):** The **South Sea Bubble** (1720) warns against speculative hype.
*   **Our Safeguard:** The value and payouts of VICTORY instruments are **explicitly and contractually tied to a real-world outcome:** the successful ratification of the treaty and the flow of real funds.
*   **The Precedent (Failure):** **Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM)** warns against underestimating systemic "black swan" risk.
*   **Our Safeguard:** We have engineered robust risk mitigation, including an **Assurance Contract** (funds returned if fundraising fails) and **first-loss philanthropic capital** to protect investors. See our [Investor Risk Analysis](../economic-models/investor-risk-analysis.md) for details.

## 6. The Endgame: A Perpetual Flywheel for Peace

After the 1% Treaty is proven successful, the model becomes a perpetual flywheel. The same process can be used to initiate referendums for incremental increases (to 1.5%, then 2%), systematically and voluntarily phasing out the global war economy over generations and redirecting our collective genius toward solving humanity's greatest challenges.
