## Why 3.5%? The Tipping Point for Systemic Change

Research shows that when just **3.5% of a population** actively participates in a movement, systemic change becomes highly likely ([source](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)). For the FDA Upgrade and Right to Trial Initiative, this means mobilizing **3.5% of the population in key countries around the world**, starting with an initial target of **12 million Americans**. Reaching this tipping point in major nations is the key to creating the political will for global policy transformation.

> The "3.5% rule" is based on research by political scientist Erica Chenoweth, who analyzed hundreds of nonviolent movements and found that those engaging at least 3.5% of the population have never failed to achieve serious political change. This threshold is now widely cited as the tipping point for successful social movements ([BBC Future](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world), [Chenoweth & Stephan, 2011](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt7s7wm)).

## The 80X Efficiency Benchmark: Oxford RECOVERY Trial

The [Oxford RECOVERY trial](https://www.recoverytrial.net/) demonstrated that decentralized, pragmatic trials can reduce per-patient costs from **$41,000** to **$500**—an **80X efficiency gain** ([Manhattan Institute](https://manhattan.institute/article/slow-costly-clinical-trials-drag-down-biomedical-breakthroughs), [NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7295430/)). This model saved over **1 million lives** globally by rapidly identifying effective COVID-19 treatments ([UKRI Impact Report](https://www.ukri.org/who-we-are/how-we-are-doing/research-outcomes-and-impact/mrc/recovery-trial-identifies-covid-19-treatments/)).

> **Goal:** Replicate this 80X efficiency for all medical research by passing aligned legislation in multiple countries, using viral referral rewards to reach the 3.5% tipping point in each nation.

## Evidence of Latent Public Support (U.S. Case Study)

*While polling shows similar sentiment exists worldwide, the following data from the United States serves as a strong case study for the latent public support waiting to be mobilized.*

| Data point                                                                        | Source                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 87 % of Americans say clinical-trial participation should be part of regular care | ([Research!America survey 87 %](https://www.researchamerica.org/press-releases-statements/large-majority-of-americans-say-consideration-of-clinical-trial-participation-should-be-a-part-of-regular-health-care/))                               |
| >80 % approval when longevity is framed as "health improvement"                   | ([Health-span framing study 2024](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/articlepdf/2827753/garmany_2024_oi_241395_1733259944.03263.pdf)) |

> **Take-away:** The core challenge is not a lack of public support, but the absence of a legal and logistical path to channel that sentiment into effective action.

## How Referral Rewards Drive Viral Participation

A well-designed referral-rewards system can:

- **Drop verified-vote costs below $1** (and as low as $0.20–$0.30 in viral scenarios)
- Mobilize millions through organic, peer-driven sharing
- Incentivize both direct action and network growth

### Cost Breakdown (per verified vote)

| Component         | Conservative | Aggressive (Viral) | Notes                                 |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Direct Rewards   | $0.50–$0.75  | $0.30–$0.50        | Cash, merch, or crypto                |
| Paid Reach       | $0.75–$1.00  | $0.10              | Ads, influencer micro-fees            |
| Verification     | $0.25        | $0.05              | KYC-lite vs. email/phone only         |
| **Total**        | **$1.50–$2** | **$0.45–$0.65**    | Can drop to $0.20–$0.30 in best case  |

**Benchmarks:**

- **EveryLibrary – "Fight for the First" 2023–24:** Email-verified petition/pledge to local officials. Reported cost ≈ **$0.56 per verified action** (derived from $250–$1,000 ad spend per local drive producing 90,000 actions across ~100 drives). ([Source: EveryLibrary About](https://www.everylibrary.org/about-everylibrary))
- **EveryLibrary Facebook/email drives (internal recap):** Library-funding calls & petitions reported at "A few **pennies per action**". ([Source: EveryLibrary cost-per-action ("few pennies")](https://pcsweeney.com/tag/library-activism/))
- **Change.org Promoted Petitions:** Uses a Cost Per Mille (CPM) or cost-per-impression model.
  - "$100 invested by promotions, a petition will be featured to 2,000 people" (equates to $0.05 per impression or $50 CPM). ([Source: Change.org Help](https://help.change.org/supporting-petition/what-does-it-mean-to-promote-a-petition))
  - "$8 will result in the petition ads being displayed to 100 people" (equates to $0.08 per impression or $80 CPM). ([Source: Change.org FAQ](https://www.change.org/l/us/chipping-in-explained))
  - Based on typical signature-conversion rates quoted in user analyses, the **effective cost is estimated at $0.20–$0.40 per added signature**. ([Sources: The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/15/avaaz-online-campaigning-reinvent-politics), [Change.org Promoted Petitions Instructions](https://www.change.org/l/hi/promoted-petitions-instructions), [Change.org promoted petition math](https://help.change.org/supporting-petition/what-does-it-mean-to-promote-a-petition))
  *Note: The effective cost per action (e.g., signature) is variable and depends on the petition's conversion rate from impression to signature.*
- **Avaaz global pledge initiatives:** Email-verified signatures reported at **≈ $0.32 per action** (Avaaz finance FAQ). ([Source: Avaaz finance page (≈ \$0.32 CPA)](https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/avaaz_expenses_and_financial_information/))
- [GiveDirectly 2021](https://www.givedirectly.org/): $0.48 per verified crypto match
- **Cost to Obtain Survey Responses (Platform Cost):** Survey platforms like Pollfish indicate costs to businesses starting at ~$0.95 per survey completion, which is the platform's charge for acquiring a response, not a direct referral payout. ([Pollfish](https://www.pollfish.com/pricing/survey-calculator/))
- **Voter Turnout Referrals (Get-Out-the-Vote Initiative Specific):** Some get-out-the-vote initiatives have offered referrers around $10 per successful referral for getting someone to vote in an official election. ([TurnoutTeam.com](https://turnoutteam.com/))
- **U.S. Ballot Initiative Field Collection (2024 Average):** *Wet-ink* legal signatures (a much higher bar). Reported cost: **$14.87 per signature**. ([Source: Ballotpedia 2024](https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_measure_signature_costs%2C_2024))
- **General Referral Incentive Sizing:** Referral rewards are often determined based on the expected value or Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) of the referred individual. A common approach is to offer a fraction of this value back to the referrer and/or the new user. ([Andrew Chen - How to Design a Referral Program](https://andrewchen.com/how-to-design-a-referral-program/))

> **Take-away:** Digital advocacy groups are already acquiring verified actions for **well under $0.60**. A performance cap of **≤ $0.50 per verified pledge** (and bonuses for < $0.30) is defensible. Using digital tactics and referral loops, **< $0.50 per verified pledge** is achievable.

## Practical Steps to Achieve Viral Scale

1. **Jackpot-Lottery + Leaderboard**
   - Weekly $500 prizes for top referrers
   - Random $50 draws for anyone with ≥1 referral
   - Keeps marginal cost per new vote near zero after pool is funded
2. **Lower-Touch Verification (Early Phases)**
   - Email + phone OTP for initial onboarding
   - Add selfie-ID only when legally required by a jurisdiction
   - Saves $0.15–$0.20 per participant
3. **Partner Newsletters > Paid Ads**
   - Ready-to-send HTML for disease foundations, patient forums, Reddit, etc.
   - A single 100k-subscriber list at 5% conversion = 5,000 votes for almost no incremental cash
4. **Track K-Factor (Viral Coefficient) Weekly**
   - K > 0.8: Cut ad spend
   - K < 0.5: Top up jackpot or test new creatives

## Cost Scenarios for 200,000 Verified Votes

| Scenario             | Reward Pool | Paid Ads | Ops    | Total   | $/vote |
|----------------------|------------|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| Baseline (roadmap)   | $25k       | $150k    | $25k   | $200k   | $1.00  |
| Partner-list heavy   | $25k       | $40k     | $20k   | $85k    | $0.43  |
| Viral best-case      | $25k       | $15k     | $10k   | $50k    | $0.25  |

## $VICTORY Tokens: Funding the Referral Rewards System

### Why $VICTORY Tokens?

- Inspired by WWII war bonds, $VICTORY tokens are a digital, transparent way to fund the movement for 80X faster medical progress.
- Purpose: Directly finance this viral referral-rewards system to mobilize 3.5% of the population in countries around the world, enabling the passage of legislation for systemic research reform.
- Goal: Unlock the same scale of transformation as the Oxford RECOVERY trial, which achieved an [80X efficiency gain](https://www.recoverytrial.net/) in clinical research.

### How It Works

- **Purchase $VICTORY tokens** to fund verified votes and actions in support of the Act.
- **Each token** directly funds a specific number of verified votes (target: <$1 per vote, with potential for $0.20–$0.30 in viral scenarios—see the "Benchmarks" section above).
- **All transactions** are transparently tracked on-chain, with a public dashboard showing progress toward the 3.5% tipping point ([BBC Future](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190513-it-only-takes-35-of-people-to-change-the-world)).

### Incentives for Supporters

- **Share in future healthcare savings** or referral jackpots, aligning incentives with the initiative's success.
- **Governance rights**: Token holders may help steer the initiative's direction and reward distribution.
- **Recognition**: Top contributors featured on leaderboards and in updates.

### Transparency & Accountability

- **Open, auditable records** of all token sales and reward distributions.
- **Real-time impact dashboard**: See how many votes/actions your support has funded.
- **Economic model**: "Every $1,000 in $VICTORY tokens funds 1,000+ verified votes, unlocking $X in healthcare savings and Y lives improved."

## Concrete Path to Mobilization (Global Template)

| Phase                            | Deliverable                           | Target                                   | Budget guide                    |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **0. Infra (3 mo)**              | Pledge stack + referral engine        | Live; fraud-checked                      | ≈ \$60 k (engineer, ads, tests) |
| **1. Pilot Region/District (1-2 mo)**   | 10-20 k pledges in one swing region | ≤ \$0.50 CPA                             | ≤ \$10 k                        |
| **2. Country-wide Scale (6-9 mo)** | 1 M pledges in first target country      | \$0.30-\$0.40 CPA                          | \$300-\$400 k                   |
| **3. Policy Channel**            | Bill text + briefings for legislators  | —                                        | parallel                        |
| **4. Must-pass Vehicle**         | Attach to major health legislation (e.g., U.S. FDA User-Fee Act) | —                                        | coalition                       |

## Addressing Political Friction (U.S. Case Study)

*The risks and mitigation strategies below are specific to the United States effort and serve as a template for analysis in other target countries.*

| Risk                                  | Mitigation                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Safety advocates claim "deregulation" | Emphasize RECOVERY-style pragmatic trials & safety analytics.               |
| FDA inertia                           | Frame as **Phase IV modernization** rather than gutting the agency.                |
| Pharma incumbents                     | Seek endorsements from small-biotech and generics eager for cheaper trials. |

## Bottom-Line Feasibility Analysis (Initial U.S. Initiative)

| Factor                    | Feasible?                          | Evidence                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Latent public support     | ✅                                  | see section 1 (polls & RTT precedent) |
| Cost to reach 1 M pledges | ✅ (\$0.5 × 1 M = \$500 k)          | section 3 benchmarks                  |
| Legislative path          | ✅ (e.g., 2027 UFA or RTT-2.0)            | historical use of must-pass riders    |
| Execution risk            | ⚠️ needs milestones & single owner | see digital CPA cases                 |

**Conclusion:** With disciplined list-building (≤ \$0.50 CPA) and a suitable "must-pass" legislative vehicle in each target country, this public education effort is realistically winnable on a global scale. The immediate next step is building the pledge engine and proving the model in a pilot region.

---

## Why This Matters: Quantitative Impact

- **Replicating RECOVERY's 80X efficiency** would allow nations to run 80 times more trials for the same budget ([reference](reference/recovery-trial.md)).
- Mobilizing 3.5% of the population with referral rewards can create the political will to pass enabling legislation worldwide, unlocking these savings for all diseases.
- **Potential: Save millions of lives, cut drug development costs by 95%, and accelerate cures for rare and common diseases alike.**

## Real-World Impact: How Public Support Drives Policy Change

Below are three well-documented cases where **large-scale, measurable public support translated into concrete policy change.** They illustrate different mechanisms—petitions, massive online comments, and sustained mobilization—so you can show Keith (or anyone) that *numbers really do move lawmakers* when the threshold is high enough.

| Case                                            | Scale of Support                                                                                                  | Immediate Trigger                                                                                                | Policy Outcome                                                                                                                 | Source                                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **U.S. Net Neutrality (2014-15)**               | *≈ 4 million public comments* to the FCC + 100 000-signature White-House petition                                 | FCC and White House both had to issue formal responses; President Obama publicly urged Title II reclassification | FCC adopted **strong Title II net-neutrality rules** in Feb 2015                                                               | ([time.com][1], [washingtonpost.com][2])              |
| **UK Parliament e-petitions**                   | Any petition that hits **100 000 signatures** is "almost always" scheduled for a floor debate                     | Reaching the threshold forces the Petitions Committee to respond and usually sets a debate date                  | Examples include debates on meningitis vaccines, Brexit preparations, and highway code changes that later informed legislation | ([petition.parliament.uk][3], [parliament.uk][4])     |
| **Non-violent movements 1900-2006 (Chenoweth)** | When \~**3.5 % of a population** participates actively, such movements have **never failed** in the historical dataset | Sustained mass participation (boycotts, strikes, demonstrations)                                                 | Regime change or major policy concessions in >50 cases (e.g., Philippines 1986, Serbia 2000)                                   | ([news.harvard.edu][5], [nonviolent-conflict.org][6]) |

### Take-aways you can cite

1. **Digital advocacy ≠ empty clicks.**
   Net-neutrality's *4 million comments* and *100 k petition* directly preceded the FCC's strongest pro-consumer rule-making in decades.

2. **Formal thresholds matter.**
   In the UK system, **100 000 signers reliably buys parliamentary airtime**—a practical, repeatable path from signature to legislative debate.

3. **The 3.5 % rule is real.**
   Harvard's Erica Chenoweth shows that *active* engagement at that scale (e.g., ≈ 12 M Americans) has been historically sufficient for transformative change every single time it's been reached.

So when you propose a pledge/ referral system that can gather tens of thousands—or eventually millions—of *district-mapped yes/no pledges*, you're standing on solid historical precedent: **big verified numbers force decision-makers to act.**
