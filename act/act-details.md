## TITLE I — SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; PURPOSE; DEFINITIONS

### SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE

This Act may be cited as the **"Right‑to‑Trial and FDA Upgrade Act of 2025."**

### SEC. 102. FINDINGS

Congress finds the following:

(1) The current healthcare and medical research system suffers from critical inefficiencies and inequities:
    (a) ⏳ **Bureaucratic and Regulatory Delays:** Life-saving treatments are often delayed by a median of 8.3 years from first-in-human studies to regulatory approval ([PMC, 2023](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9869766/); [Applied Clinical Trials, 2020](https://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/view/fda-s-expedited-review-process-need-speed)).
    (b) 🚫 **Exclusion from Clinical Trials:** The median exclusion rate from randomized controlled trials for physical conditions is 77.1% (IQR 55.5%–89.0%), with common chronic conditions like asthma and hypertension exceeding 80% ([PMC, 2020](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7045589/)).
    (c) 💰 **Excessive Drug Development Costs:** The average cost to develop and win marketing approval for a new drug is $2.6 billion ([Applied Clinical Trials, 2020](https://www.appliedclinicaltrialsonline.com/view/tufts-center-study-drug-development-cost-developing-new-drugs)). Median per‑patient cost for a pivotal (phase 3) study for new drugs approved by the FDA is about $41,117 ([Sofpromed, 2024](https://www.sofpromed.com/how-much-does-a-clinical-trial-cost)).
    (d) 📈 **Misaligned Research Incentives:** Only about 1% of new drug approvals in the US and EU from 2000–2011 were for neglected tropical diseases, and only 1% of all clinical trials involved products for these unmet needs ([INET Economics, 2024](https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/the-global-pharmaceutical-industry-isnt-investing-in-products-for-the-greatest-burden-of-human-disease-are-non-profits-a-solution); [PubMed, 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23697824/)).
    (e) ⏱️ **Prolonged Waits for Breakthrough Therapies:** The FDA's breakthrough therapy designation program lowers late-stage clinical development time by about 30%. For cancer drugs, median time to first FDA approval was 5.2 years for breakthrough-designated drugs vs. 7.1 years for non-breakthrough ([ASPE, 2024](https://aspe.hhs.gov/reports/fda-breakthrough-therapy-designation-reduced-late-stage-drug-development-time); [PubMed, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29688832/)).
    (f) 🌍 **Delayed Access Compared to Other Nations:** Drug approval lags between the US and other countries have declined, but for some drug classes, the US still lags by 2.9–5.1 years compared to first global launch ([Springer, 2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11166-013-9169-5)).
    (g) 💊 **Lack of Treatments for Most Diseases:** Less than 22% of the 18,500 recognized diseases have FDA-approved treatments. For rare diseases, about 95% lack an FDA-approved treatment ([Every Cure](https://everycure.org/the-problem/); [NCATS/NIH, 2023](https://ncats.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NCATS_RareDiseasesFactSheet.pdf)).
    (h) 📊 **Neglect of Real-World Evidence:** The current system often fails to systematically collect, analyze, and integrate real-world evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness and safety of treatments across diverse patient populations.
    (i) 🙈 **Publication Bias:** Negative or inconclusive trial results are often unpublished, leading to redundant research efforts and a skewed understanding of treatment efficacy.
    (j) 🥫 **Data Scarcity on Unpatentable Interventions:** There is a significant lack of data on the long-term effects and comparative effectiveness of unpatentable interventions, including many foods, dietary patterns, and existing repurposed drugs.
    (k) 🗓 **Insufficient Long-Term Outcome Data:** Many clinical trials are of short duration, providing limited information on the long-term benefits and risks of treatments.

(2) Modern technology and decentralized approaches, as demonstrated by initiatives like the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](https://www.recoverytrial.net/), offer the potential to dramatically accelerate medical research, reduce costs by up to 80-95%, and improve patient access to care. The U.K. **RECOVERY** pragmatic trial enrolled [49,000 patients in 100 days at roughly $500 per patient](https://www.recoverytrial.net/), demonstrating 90 percent cost reduction via adaptive, decentralized design.

(3) Patients have a fundamental interest in making informed decisions about their healthcare, including the option to participate in well-regulated clinical trials for investigational treatments when existing options are insufficient.

(4) An open, transparent, and publicly accessible platform for clinical trial data, treatment outcomes, and regulatory information can empower patients, clinicians, and researchers, fostering innovation and public trust. Publicly financed, algorithm‑targeted subsidies that maximize **quality‑adjusted life‑years (QALYs) per federal dollar** can democratize access while a modest patient co‑payment curbs moral hazard.

(5) A single, open‑source **FDA.gov v2 Decentralized Trial Platform**—with e‑protocol builders, liability‑insurance bidding, blockchain custody, and AI‑ranked treatment lists—will enable any willing patient to join a trial of the most‑promising therapy for their condition.

(6) Modernizing FDA regulation to embrace real‑world evidence, remote monitoring, and validated non‑animal test methods will accelerate safe cures.

### SEC. 103. PURPOSE

The purposes of this Act are—

(1) To establish and guarantee the right of eligible patients to participate in approved clinical trials for investigational treatments for their conditions, particularly when currently available treatments are ineffective or unsatisfactory.
(2) To mandate the creation, operation, and continuous improvement of the "FDA.gov v2 Decentralized Trial Platform," a publicly owned, open-source, and interoperable digital platform for managing all aspects of clinical research, treatment information, and regulatory processes.
(3) To dramatically reduce the cost and time associated with clinical trials by leveraging decentralized methodologies, automation, real-world data, and the FDA.gov v2 Decentralized Trial Platform.
(4) To ensure comprehensive, transparent, and unbiased collection, analysis, and dissemination of data on the safety and effectiveness of all treatments, including through standardized "Outcome Labels" and comparative effectiveness rankings.
(5) To foster a collaborative and innovative research ecosystem by making anonymized research data, tools, and platform functionalities openly available.
(6) To establish an AI-powered system, integrated within the FDA.gov v2 Decentralized Trial Platform as Platform Intelligence (FDAi), to support patients, researchers, and regulators by analyzing data, providing personalized insights, and enhancing regulatory oversight.
(7) To realign financial incentives to reward the development of cures, preventative interventions, and treatments that provide significant value to patients and public health.
(8) To enhance public trust in the medical research and regulatory system through radical transparency, accountability, and patient-centeredness.

    (1) An individual shall be considered an "eligible patient" if they: (A) have been diagnosed with a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, or a chronic condition for which existing approved treatments are unsatisfactory, have failed, or are not tolerated; (B) have consulted with a licensed physician knowledgeable about their condition and the investigational treatment, who attests that there are no comparable satisfactory approved options and potential benefits outweigh risks; (C) are capable of providing, and have provided, written informed consent; and (D) meet specific trial inclusion/exclusion criteria, unless a waiver is granted. The referring physician must not be the sponsor or an investigator of the specific trial unless conflict of interest mitigation is approved.
    (2) Sponsors or IRBs may exclude an individual patient **solely for documented, evidence‑based safety reasons** (e.g., a specific contraindication, allergy, or organ‑system risk) or if investigational‑product supply is demonstrably insufficient. Exclusion rationales must be transmitted to the FDA Dashboard within 7 days and are subject to FDA audit.
(d) **NIH Micro‑Study Fallback.** If no sponsor operates an active investigational‑new‑drug application that can accept the patient within 60 days of request, the NIH—using Other Transaction Authority—shall initiate a single‑arm or adaptive micro‑study to provide the intervention under IND and collect outcomes via the Platform; such micro‑studies qualify for subsidies under § 303.
(e) **Adaptive Enrolment.** Sponsors participating under this section must accept data‑driven lowering of exclusion criteria unless an IRB documents incremental safety risk.
(f) **No Entitlement to Unapproved Treatments Outside of Trials**: This section does not create an entitlement to an investigational treatment outside the context of a clinical trial approved and conducted via the FDA.gov v2 Decentralized Trial Platform.

### SEC. 302. PATIENT PROTECTIONS, CONSENT, AND LIABILITY

(a) **Central IRB.** All Right‑to‑Trial protocols shall undergo single‑IRB review per 45 CFR § 46.114\[8]; FDA shall publish a master reliance agreement.
(b) **Informed Consent.**
    (1) Platform e‑consent shall disclose investigational nature, trial procedures, known/unknown risks (as per Outcome Label and protocol), potential benefits, alternatives, confidentiality extent, injury compensation, contact information, voluntary participation statement, and data use/sharing for continuous improvement.
    (2) Execution of the e‑consent **constitutes both 45 CFR § 164.508 authorization and, where applicable, a waiver of authorization under § 164.512(i)\[11] for research use of protected health information**, as approved by the reviewing IRB; signed consent is hashed and stored on the blockchain ledger.
(c) **Safety Monitoring.** Sponsors must stream adverse‑event data to the Dashboard within 24 hours; FDA may halt enrolment under 21 CFR § 312.42.
(d) **Liability Shield.** Good‑faith compliance grants immunity from tort claims except for gross negligence or willful misconduct; mirrors Pub. L. 115‑176 § 2(c). Liability for harm shall be addressed via applicable law and sponsor's liability insurance.
(e) **Patient Responsibilities**: Patients exercising their Right to Trial are responsible for adhering to trial protocols, reporting outcomes and adverse events accurately and in a timely manner, and maintaining communication with the trial team.
(f) **Data Contribution and Use**: As a condition of participation, patients consent to collection and use of their anonymized/de-identified trial data for purposes outlined in this Act. Patients retain ownership of identifiable health information and the Platform shall provide tools for privacy preference management consistent with research integrity.

### SEC. 303. NIH PARTICIPATION SUBSIDIES

(a) **Fund.** A revolving Clinical‑Trial Participation Subsidy Fund is established; authorized to receive \$2 billion FY 2026–30.
(b) **Allocation Algorithm.** NIH shall develop, publish, and annually recompute an open optimisation model for the allocation of subsidies. This model shall aim to maximize public health value, primarily assessed by **(1) projected quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained per dollar of subsidy, (2) the potential for significant healthcare system cost savings, and (3) the marginal scientific value of the research, including the value of reducing uncertainty for interventions with limited existing evidence but high potential impact.** The algorithm shall incorporate factors such as disease prevalence/severity, impact on morbidity/mortality, number/diversity of participants needed, marginal value of additional data, and socioeconomic barriers. The algorithm and its parameters shall be published, subject to public comment, and updated at least annually to reflect advances in evidence, policy priorities, and stakeholder feedback. It shall be designed to dynamically incorporate new evidence on treatment efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness as it is generated through the FDA.gov v2 Decentralized Trial Platform.
(c) **Payments.** NIH pays sponsors per enrolled participant up to the algorithmic cap; sponsors certify costs and submit outcomes. The subsidy system shall be transparent, equitable, and designed to maximize both patient access and societal value of research.
(d) **Audit.** GAO shall audit fund disbursements biennially; claw‑back for mis‑certified costs.

### SEC. 304. PATIENT COST‑SHARING AND INSURANCE

(a) **Minimum Co‑payment.** Each participant shall pay a non‑zero fee set by the Secretary between the 25th and 75th percentile of commercial‑insurance specialist‑visit copays for the preceding year, **adjusted annually by the CPI‑U** (initially \$15–\$40 per visit).
(b) **Cap and Cost Disclosure.** Sponsors may not bill participants beyond the statutory co‑pay; NIH subsidy + sponsor absorb remaining costs. Cost schedule and co‑pay displayed in e‑consent; participants may terminate if costs subsequently rise. The Act does not mandate sponsors provide investigational products free of charge, but sponsors must clearly state any costs to the patient on the Platform, which shall facilitate access to financial assistance information.
(c) **Routine Care Costs.** Health insurance plans shall not deny coverage for routine medical care that a patient would otherwise be entitled to receive, solely on the basis of their participation in a clinical trial under this Act. Disputes shall be resolved through a mechanism established by the Secretary.

# 🚀 RIGHT TO TRIAL & FDA UPGRADE ACT v1

## SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE, FINDINGS, AND PURPOSE

### 1.1 Short Title

This Act may be cited as the **"Right to Trial & FDA Upgrade Act"**.

### 1.2 Findings

The Congress finds that:

(1) The current healthcare and medical research system suffers from critical inefficiencies and inequities:
    (a) ⏳ **Bureaucratic and Regulatory Delays:** Life-saving treatments are often delayed by 7-12 years from discovery to patient access.
    (b) 🚫 **Exclusion from Clinical Trials:** Approximately [97% of patients](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/111/3/245/5307078) (and [85% by other estimates](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14628985)) are excluded from or unable to participate in clinical trials, denying access to potentially life-saving investigational treatments and limiting the generalizability of trial results.
    (c) 💰 **Excessive Drug Development Costs:** The average cost to develop a new treatment is approximately [$2.6 billion](https://csdd.tufts.edu/csddnews/2018/3/9/march-2016-tufts-csdd-rd-cost-study) (with some estimates at [$1.6 billion](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762311)), these costs are ultimately passed on to patients, insurers, and taxpayers.
    (d) 📈 **Misaligned Research Incentives:** A significant portion of research and development, estimated at [80% by some sources](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-18-40), focuses on treatments with high profit potential rather than on those with the greatest public health impact or on affordable alternatives.
    (e) ⏱️ **Prolonged Waits for Breakthrough Therapies:** Patients with terminal or life-altering conditions often wait [4+ years for breakthrough therapy approvals](https://www.fda.gov/media/151060/download).
    (f) 🌍 **Delayed Access Compared to Other Nations:** Approval and availability of new treatments in the United States can [lag 3-5 years behind](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa1610301) approvals in other developed nations.
    (g) 💊 **Lack of Treatments for Most Diseases:** An estimated [95% of diseases](https://ncats.nih.gov/sites/default/files/NCATS_RareDiseasesFactSheet.pdf) have no FDA-approved treatment, leaving millions of patients with limited options.
    (h) 📊 **Neglect of Real-World Evidence:** The current system often fails to systematically collect, analyze, and integrate real-world evidence regarding the comparative effectiveness and safety of treatments across diverse patient populations.
    (i) 🙈 **Publication Bias:** Negative or inconclusive trial results are often unpublished, leading to redundant research efforts and a skewed understanding of treatment efficacy.
    (j) 🥫 **Data Scarcity on Unpatentable Interventions:** There is a significant lack of data on the long-term effects and comparative effectiveness of unpatentable interventions, including many foods, dietary patterns, and existing repurposed drugs.
    (k) 🗓 **Insufficient Long-Term Outcome Data:** Many clinical trials are of short duration, providing limited information on the long-term benefits and risks of treatments.

(2) Modern technology and decentralized approaches, as demonstrated by initiatives like the [Oxford RECOVERY trial](https://www.recoverytrial.net/), offer the potential to dramatically accelerate medical research, reduce costs by up to 80-95%, and improve patient access to care.

(3) Patients have a fundamental interest in making informed decisions about their healthcare, including the option to participate in well-regulated clinical trials for investigational treatments when existing options are insufficient.

(4) An open, transparent, and publicly accessible platform for clinical trial data, treatment outcomes, and regulatory information can empower patients, clinicians, and researchers, fostering innovation and public trust.

### 1.3 Purpose

The purposes of this Act are—

(1) To establish and guarantee the right of eligible patients to participate in approved clinical trials for investigational treatments for their conditions, particularly when currently available treatments are ineffective or unsatisfactory.
(2) To mandate the creation, operation, and continuous improvement of "FDA.gov v2," a publicly owned, open-source, and interoperable digital platform for managing all aspects of clinical research, treatment information, and regulatory processes.
(3) To dramatically reduce the cost and time associated with clinical trials by leveraging decentralized methodologies, automation, real-world data, and the FDA.gov v2 platform.
(4) To ensure comprehensive, transparent, and unbiased collection, analysis, and dissemination of data on the safety and effectiveness of all treatments, including through standardized "Outcome Labels" and comparative effectiveness rankings.
(5) To foster a collaborative and innovative research ecosystem by making anonymized research data, tools, and platform functionalities openly available.
(6) To establish an AI-powered system, "FDAi," to support patients, researchers, and regulators by analyzing data, providing personalized insights, and enhancing regulatory oversight.
(7) To realign financial incentives to reward the development of cures, preventative interventions, and treatments that provide significant value to patients and public health.
(8) To enhance public trust in the medical research and regulatory system through radical transparency, accountability, and patient-centeredness.
