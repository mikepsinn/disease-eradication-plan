<p>The mandate of the Decentralized Food and Drug Administration (deFDA) is to <strong>maximize </strong>the <strong>average healthy human lifespan (</strong>as measured by quality-adjusted life-years or QALYs). We intend to design optimized regulatory policies using the combined wisdom of thousands of experts. &nbsp;</p>
<h1>A New and Improved FDA Mandate</h1>
<p>Congress created the US Food and Drug Administration to protect and promote human health and safety. Unfortunately, the 1962 law describing what the FDA is supposed to do is so poorly written that it has become a significant obstacle to the work of scientists who are trying to discover new cures.</p>
<p>The FDA is currently mandated to ensure the "<strong>efficacy of drugs."</strong> This is an ideal goal, but the only way to <strong>perfectly </strong>fulfill this mandate is to ensure that no one ever takes a new drug again. That would 100% guarantee that no one ever has the opportunity to take a medication that may or may not be effective.</p>
<p>In practice, we've seen a less absolutist interpretation of the mandate. Instead of rejecting all new treatments, they have exponentially increased the regulatory barrier. Since 1962, when congress imposed the current framework, the cost of bringing a new therapy to market has increased 15X (1521%).</p>

<p>So the 1962 efficacy mandate doesn't weigh the costs of the regulatory burden against the reduction in treatments that are an inevitable tradeoff. If something costs twice as much, you can only afford to buy half as much. This is precisely what we've seen in the 70% reduction in new therapies immediately following the modification.</p>

<p>Over the previous 50 years, rapid advancements in medical science had produced a 4-year increase in human lifespan every decade. This amazingly linear growth rate had followed millennia with a flat human lifespan of around 28 years. Following this new 1962 70% reduction in the pace of medical progress, the growth in human lifespan was immediately cut in half to an increase of 2 years per decade.</p>
