Humans have a cognitive bias towards weighting harmful acts of commission to be worse than acts of omission, even if the act of omission causes greater harm. It's seen in the trolley problem, where people generally aren't willing to push a fat man in front of a train to save a family, even though more lives would be saved.

Medical researcher Dr. Henry I. Miller, MS, MD described his experience working at the FDA, “In the early 1980s,” Miller wrote, “when I headed the team at the FDA that was reviewing the NDA \[application] for recombinant human insulin…my supervisor refused to sign off on the approval,” despite ample evidence of the drug’s ability to safely and effectively treat patients. His supervisor rationally concluded that, if there was a death or complication due to the medication, heads would roll at the FDA—including his own. So the personal risk of approving a drug is magnitudes larger than the risk of rejecting it.

In a DAO comprised of a large number of prominent experts, no individual could be blamed or have their career destroyed for making a correct decision to save the invisible lives of the many at the risk of the lives of the few.

**It's Impossible to Report on Deaths That Occurred Due to Unavailable Treatments**

Here's a news story from the Non-Existent Times by No One Ever without a picture of all the people that die from lack of access to life-saving treatments that might have been.

This means that it's only logical for regulators to reject drug applications by default. The personal risks of approving a drug with any newsworthy side effect far outweigh the personal risk of preventing access to life-saving treatment.
