FDA delays in approving new drugs and treatments that are already available in other countries result in up to [120,000 preventable deaths per decade](https://www.fdareview.org/features/references/#gieringer85) in the United States. This "drug lag" occurs when life-saving medications are available to patients in other countries years before US patients can access them.

## Impact

* Beta-blockers alone caused tens of thousands of preventable deaths
* Many critical drugs face 1+ year delays compared to other countries
* Affects treatments for cancer, heart disease, and other serious conditions
