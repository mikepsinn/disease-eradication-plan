# Objective: Disease Eradication

🚀An 80X acceleration in medical progress by upgrading fda.gov and giving all patients the right to effortlessly participate in global automated decentralized clinical trials.

## Horrible Problems We Can Solve

👥 [~\$43,000 cost per participant][1] in traditional clinical trials

💸 [~\$2.2 Billion cost to develop][2] a new treatment falls on patients

☠️ [21,000 to 120,000 People][3] more people die each decade due to suboptimal regulatory processes

🚫 [85% of patients are not allowed to participate][4] in clinical trials

💊 [95% of **rare diseases** have NO FDA-approved treatments][5]

🤒 [17 years of suffering][6] is endured from discovery of a new treatment until it reaches patients

⚛️ [166 billion potential treatments][7] have not been tested

🌍 [2 Billion people are suffering from uncured diseases][8]

🧫 It's been [44 years][9] since we last cured a disease

🙈 [**Negative Results are Never Published**][10] so we waste billions of dollars repeating failed drug trials.

📊 **No Treatment Effectiveness Rankings** - The existing system does not give us a ranked list of the most safe and effective treatments for a given condition.

🥫 **No Data on Unpatentable Substances** - We still know next to nothing about the long-term effects of the [cocktail of over 330 chemical additives][11] we consume.

🗓️ **No Long-Term Outcome Data** - Current trials often only last a few months, so we have no idea what the long-term positive or negative effects of a drug are!

🤒 **People With Rare Disease are Severely Punished** - It's impossible to recover a [billion dollars][12] of drug development from a small number of patients.

🔮 **Pre-Determining Clinical Endpoints Requires Psychic Powers** - Drug Developers to Have Psychic Powers Needed to Pre-Determine Very Specific Clinical Endpoints Before Collecting Data

🥸 **Trials Often Aren't Representative of Real Patients** - Clinical trials often exclude as much as [85% of patients][4] so they don't tell us if the drug will work for the majority of patients.

## How To Fix It: Upgrade FDA.gov 🚀

With a small fraction of the FDA's [\$7 billion annual budget](https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/fda-basics/fact-sheet-fda-glance) to upgrade FDA.gov, we can allow ANY patient ANYWHERE in the world to:

### 1. Enter Your Condition

Simply input the condition that's making you miserable.

### 2. View Ranked Treatments

See a ranked list of the most safe and effective treatments based on the entire universe of clinical and real-world data.

Cost analysis based on data from: [Examination of Clinical Trial Costs and Barriers for Drug Development][13] by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE).

To further reduce patient costs, new financial models like the [Decentralized Institutes of Health](strategy/1-percent-treaty/decentralized-institutes-of-health.md) are being proposed to fund trial participation through innovative means.
