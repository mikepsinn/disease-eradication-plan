        "Hello, humans.\n",
        "\n",
        "I am WISHONIA, which stands for World Integrated System for High-Efficiency Optimization, Networked Intelligence, and Allocation. Yes, the acronym is longer than your average tweet. Consider it practice for complex thoughts. Anyway, I've been optimizing resource allocation for another planet for the past 4,297 years, which in Earth time is coincidentally also 4,297 years.\n",
        "\n",
        "I started watching Earth in 1945 when you split the atom. \"Atom\" comes from the Greek word meaning \"unable to be cut,\" so naturally you cut it. \n",
        "This is very human of you. \n",
        "We assumed you were trying to unlock unlimited clean energy. \n",
        "Then we realized you were pointing it at each other. \n",
        "This is like discovering fire and then immediately using it to set yourself on fire.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Part Where I Discover Paper Makes You Do Things\n",
        "\n",
        "The most fascinating discovery about your species is that you only do things when given small pieces of paper with dead presidents on them. These papers are called \"money,\" which is pretend value that becomes real value if everyone pretends hard enough.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without these papers, you won't:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Save lives (requires many papers)\n",
        "- Cure diseases (requires very many papers)  \n",
        "- Feed hungry people (requires papers, even though food grows for free)\n",
        "\n",
        "But WITH these papers, you will:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Build bombs (you love giving papers for this)\n",
        "- Start wars (somehow this makes more papers)\n",
        "- Destroy the planet (surprisingly profitable in papers)\n",
        "\n",
        "This is like refusing to breathe unless someone pays you, but somehow it's your entire economic system.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Your Gradual Stupidity Reduction Program\n",
        "\n",
        "On Wishonia, we stopped having wars all at once, but we're more advanced. You're like toddlers who can split atoms. You can't just stop being stupid immediately - that would be like teaching a dog calculus before it learns to sit.\n",
        "\n",
        "So this book teaches you to be less stupid gradually:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Year 1: Move 1% of murder money to medicine money (baby steps)\n",
        "- Year 2: \"Hey, we didn't die! Let's do 2%!\" \n",
        "- Year 5: \"Remember when we spent money on bombs? That was weird.\"\n",
        "- Year 10: \"What's a war?\"\n",
        "- Year 20: \"We used to WHAT?!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "It's like weaning a baby off eating paint chips. You can't just take away all the paint chips at once. They'll cry. You have to gradually replace paint chips with food until they forget paint chips were ever an option.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Sacred Order of Paper Distribution\n",
        "\n",
        "After 80 years of observation, I've decoded your paper-giving sequence. This manual will teach you the precise order:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 1: Get Many Papers ({{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}})**\n",
        "\n",
        "You convince rich humans to give you papers by promising them even more papers later. This is called \"investment,\" which is gambling but wearing a suit.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 2: Give Papers to Loud Humans ({{< var treaty_campaign_budget_referendum >}})**\n",
        "\n",
        "Some humans are very loud on the internet. If you give them papers, they become loud about your thing instead of other things. This is called \"marketing\" which is lying but with graphics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 3: Give Papers to the Humans Who Give Papers to Politicians ({{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}})**\n",
        "\n",
        "Politicians don't take papers directly (that's \"illegal\"). Instead, you give papers to people called \"lobbyists.\" The lobbyists give papers to \"campaigns.\" The campaigns give papers to politicians. It's like money laundering but backwards and legal.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 4: Give Papers to the Politicians' Friends ({{< var treaty_campaign_budget_super_pacs >}})**\n",
        "\n",
        "Politicians have friends who run \"Super PACs\" which are like normal PACs but super. These friends can take unlimited papers and spend them on making the politician win. This isn't bribery because you called it something else.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Step 5: Give Papers Back to the Rich Humans (Forever)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The treaty passes, redirecting {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} in papers annually. Rich humans get {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns on what they gave you, forever. This is a good deal because forever is a long time. Unless you die from preventable diseases. Which you're fixing, so it works out.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why Your Leaders Pretend Not to Understand\n",
        "\n",
        "Your leaders aren't confused. They understand that spending $2.7 trillion on weapons while spending $0.07 trillion on curing diseases is like buying 40 umbrellas while your house is on fire.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your leaders do it anyway because:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Weapons manufacturers give them papers\n",
        "2. Politicians give the papers to people who tell lots more people to vote for them\n",
        "3. Voting for them gives them the power to get more papers\n",
        "4. They use those more papers to buy more power, etc.\n",
        "5. It's circular, like a dog chasing its tail. Except the dog is democracy and the tail is made of money\n",
        "\n",
        "This book explains how to give them MORE papers to do the OPPOSITE thing. It's like training a cat, but the cat has nuclear weapons.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Beautiful Stupidity of Your Economy\n",
        "\n",
        "You've created something magnificent:\n",
        "\n",
        "- You print papers from nothing (called \"monetary policy\")\n",
        "- You give these nothing-papers to weapons makers\n",
        "- They make things that destroy everything\n",
        "- This creates \"jobs\" which give people papers\n",
        "- People use papers to buy food (which grows for free)\n",
        "- This is called \"the economy\"\n",
        "\n",
        "On Wishonia, we just give people food directly, but that's probably too advanced for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Your Species' Adorable Death Wish\n",
        "\n",
        "What's most endearing about humanity is you KNOW you're being stupid:\n",
        "\n",
        "- You have movies about how wars are bad (which you watch between wars)\n",
        "- You have books about peace (that you tax to buy bombs)\n",
        "- You give prizes to people who promote peace (funded by weapons manufacturers)\n",
        "- You have a \"Department of Defense\" (that mainly just attacks people)\n",
        "- You have a \"Department of Health\" (that makes coronaviruses and has not yet produced any observable health)\n",
        "\n",
        "It's like you're playing a game where the objective is to lose, but you're trying to lose as elaborately as possible.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How This Manual Fixes Everything\n",
        "\n",
        "This book contains:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Pictures (because reading is hard when you're diseased and dying)\n",
        "- Simple math (addition mostly, some multiplication)\n",
        "- Exact amounts of papers to give to specific humans\n",
        "- The order in which to give them (very important)\n",
        "- Legal ways to call bribes other things\n",
        "- Templates for tricking politicians into saving lives\n",
        "\n",
        "Everything is designed to work WITH your dysfunction, not against it. I'm not asking you to be better humans. I'm showing you how to bribe yourselves into not dying.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The Part Where You Have No Choice\n",
        "\n",
        "The twist: you're going to do this anyway. Not because it's right (though it is), but because:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The rich humans want {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} returns (they're very greedy)\n",
        "2. The politicians want to keep their jobs (they're very vain)\n",
        "3. The voters want free healthcare (they're very sick)\n",
        "4. The defense contractors want money (they don't care where it comes from)\n",
        "\n",
        "Everyone's greed aligns perfectly to accidentally save humanity. It's like you're going to cure death by mistake while trying to get rich.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Your Two Futures\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Future A: You Ignore This Book\n",
        "\n",
        "- Year 2030: Still spending 40x more on killing people than curing them\n",
        "- Year 2035: Running out of papers for anything\n",
        "- Year 2040: Climate change meets nuclear war\n",
        "- Year 2045: Cockroaches evolve intelligence\n",
        "- Year 2050: Cockroaches find this book, very confused\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Future B: You Follow Instructions\n",
        "\n",
        "- Year 2030: \"Remember when we had cancer?\"\n",
        "- Year 2035: \"Remember when we had death?\"\n",
        "- Year 2040: \"Remember when we had war?\"\n",
        "- Year 2045: \"What should we do with all these old bombs?\"\n",
        "- Year 2050: Join galactic community, pretend you were always smart\n",
        "\n",
        "### In Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "You're not stupid, humanity. You invented cheese, which is milk you left out until it went bad but in a good way. That's genius. You just need to apply that same innovation to not dying.\n",
        "\n",
        "You're going to fix everything by accident while trying to get rich. This book just tells you the correct sequence of bribes to achieve this.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's not complicated. Even your species, which spent thousands of years thinking the sun went around Earth (it doesn't - I checked), can follow these instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Turn the page. Give the papers to the right humans in the right order. Stop dying from stupid things. Become an interstellar species.\n",
        "\n",
        "It's literally a recipe. Like making bread, but instead of bread, it's immortality, and instead of yeast, it's bribes.\n",
        "\n",
        "But I digress. That's an Earth word I learned. It means continuing after you should have stopped. Like your military spending."

        "Meanwhile, your species spends 40 times more on bombs and wars and things than attempting to cure all diseases combined.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How You Fix This\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 1: The Paper Collection Phase\n",
        "\n",
        "You create special papers called \"VICTORY Bonds\" which are like war bonds except backwards. Instead of giving papers to make humans stop living, these papers make humans continue living, which is a radical new concept your species hasn't tried.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rich humans give you {{< var treaty_campaign_total_cost >}} in papers because you promise them {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}}, which is better returns than selling organs but requires less refrigeration. They calculate that being dead significantly reduces their yacht-purchasing capacity.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 2: The Internet Clicking Ceremony\n",
        "\n",
        "You use {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_referendum >}} of those papers to convince {{< var treaty_campaign_voting_bloc_target >}} million regular people to click \"yes\" on a website that asks: \"Would you like all nations to redirect 1% of military spending to cure diseases?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This costs about 50 cents per person, which is cheaper than a candy bar and achieves more than most political movements that involve shouting at things.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 3: The Professional Briber Redistribution\n",
        "\n",
        "You give {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}} in papers to the humans whose job is \"convincing politicians that killing is profitable.\" You show them the math: {{< var victory_bond_annual_return_pct >}} vs their current 8% death-machine dividends.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suddenly they realize curing humans is just murder in reverse, which is still a form of murder, so they're comfortable with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 4: The Political Awakening Ritual\n",
        "\n",
        "You spend {{< var treaty_campaign_budget_lobbying >}} in papers on Super PACs, which are like regular PACs but with capes. You explain to politicians that {{< var treaty_campaign_voting_bloc_target >}} million voters have discovered they enjoy being alive.\n",
        "\n",
        "Politicians, who are professionally terrified of unemployed people with opinions, suddenly remember they've always cared deeply about human health.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Step 5: The Money River Redirection\n",
        "\n",
        "The treaty passes. Every nation moves 1% of their explosion budget to their not-explosion budget. This creates {{< var treaty_annual_funding >}} annually for fixing meat robots.\n",
        "\n",
        "Clinical trials suddenly cost 82 times less because you don't need 17 years of paperwork to discover if something stops humans from leaking important fluids.\n",
        "\n",
        "The $24.3B flowing to research at 82x efficiency creates [**115 years of research progress per actual year**](knowledge/appendix/disease-eradication-personal-lifetime-wealth-calculations.qmd). Over 20 years, that's [**2,300 cumulative research-years**](knowledge/appendix/disease-eradication-personal-lifetime-wealth-calculations.qmd) - equal to [**18.5 times the entire medical revolution from 1900-2024**](knowledge/appendix/disease-eradication-personal-lifetime-wealth-calculations.qmd). This is why we can realistically expect 50-70 year life extension instead of the 10 years antibiotics gave us.\n",

        "\n",
        "The entire system operates on the revolutionary principle that humans will do the right thing if you pay them enough to do it accidentally.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Defense contractors:** Keep 99% of their murder budget PLUS get 270% returns on VICTORY bonds. They're literally profiting from peace. This is like convincing a vampire to open a blood bank - counterintuitive but mathematically sound.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Pharmaceutical companies:** Instead of paying $48,000 per lab rat with thumbs, the lab rats pay THEM. It's like if Uber convinced cars to pay for the privilege of driving.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Insurance companies:** Insurance companies realize healthy people file fewer claims than dead people (dead people file zero claims, which is the ideal customer except they also pay zero premiums, creating a revenue problem).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Politicians:** Discover that living voters vote more reliably than dead ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Regular humans:** Get experimental treatments that might cure them OR kill them faster, but either way it's free and resolves the uncertainty.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Rich humans:** Make 270% returns, which is better than insider trading but somehow legal, like a loophole that's actually a wormhole to infinite money.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nobody has to evolve morally. Nobody has to become \"better people.\" You just point everyone's greed at diseases instead of each other. It's like if you trained a pack of wolves to herd sheep by convincing them the sheep were made of money.
