## How to End War and Disease in 60 Seconds

**The Problem:** [150,000 people die daily](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd) from curable diseases.
Humanity spends [\$2.7 trillion on weapons, \$68 billion on medical research](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd) (40X more on killing than curing).

**The Goal:** Get 190 nations to sign a treaty redirecting just 1% of military budgets (\$27B/year) to fund cheaper medical trials.
[Oxford proved](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) trials can cost \$500 per patient instead of the current \$41,000 (82X cheaper).

**How to Make It Happen (With \$1B):**

1.  **Sell investment bonds** - Raise \$1B by offering investors 10% of the \$27B annual treaty funds forever = \$2.7B/year = 270% returns.
2.  **Run global referendum campaign** - Spend \$56-140M to get 280 million people to vote "yes, redirect 1% to cures" (costs \$0.20-0.50 per vote for digital outreach).
3.  **Offer bonds to defense industry** - Give \$5-20M in bonds to lobbyists/executives (270% returns beats their \$500K-2M salaries, so they switch sides).
4.  **Fund political campaigns** - Spend \$800M on Super PACs supporting politicians who vote yes, opposing those who vote no.
5.  **Treaty passes** - Politicians face 280M angry voters + see everyone profiting from cures.

**Why This Works (Aligned Incentives):**

- **Defense contractors:** Keep 99% of their budgets (\$2.67T) AND get 270% bond returns - win/win.
- **Pharma companies:** Stop paying \$48K per trial patient.
Instead GET PAID by patients (who have subsidies).
- **Politicians:** Get campaign funding + avoid being voted out by 280 million referendum supporters.
- **Insurance companies:** Healthy people cost billions less than sick people.
- **Patients:** Get paid to participate in trials + vote directly on which diseases get funded.

**The Math:** Every \$1 invested creates [\$463 in benefits](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd).
<!-- TODO: Link broken. Was this file renamed or moved? -->
(better than smallpox eradication's 280:1 ROI).

**Keep reading:** How Oxford proved 82X cheaper trials work, why cutting military spending historically creates economic booms, how the legal structure avoids prison, and why defense contractors actually want this.

## The Problem

### The Daily Holocaust

[150,000 people die daily](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd) from curable diseases - that's equal to [18,274 September 11 terrorist attacks](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd) per year.



![Annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)


Your body is quietly falling apart.
Your cancer cells are multiplying RIGHT NOW.
Your brain is deleting memories.
Your joints are slowly turning into gravel.
Your heart is getting tired of beating.
Your telomeres are shortening.
You are literally dissolving.

**You're a meat robot with worn-out parts.
Every one of these failures is a solvable engineering problem.**

You'd think we'd prioritize solving these problems.
You'd be adorable for thinking that.

[We haven't cured a single disease](brain/book/problem/nih-spent-1-trillion-eradicating-0-diseases.qmd) in [50 years](./brain/book/references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated).
But we have [13,000 nuclear warheads](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd), enough to end civilization 13 times, just in case the first apocalypse doesn't take.

### The Cost of War

We spend **[\$2.72 trillion](./brain/book/references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)** every year on stuff designed specifically to make humans stop being alive.

This shopping list includes:

- Nuclear bombs.
- Bullets.
- AI murder-bots.
- Invisible jets that cost more than hospitals.
- Satellites that can see your bald spot from space.
- Probably some kind of earthquake machine.

Meanwhile, we spend [\$68 billion on medical research](brain/book/reference/global-government-medical-research-spending.qmd).
That's [**40 times less**](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd) on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses.

{{< include brain/figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-1-percent-treaty-column-chart.qmd >}}

The Pentagon alone has [**lost** \$2.5 trillion](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd).
Not spent.
Lost.
Like change in a couch, except the couch is the size of Nebraska and the change could cure cancer hundreds of times over.

We have a Space Force but no Death Force.
[Your chance of dying from terrorism: 1 in 30 million](brain/book/references.qmd#terrorism-vs-disease-risk).
Your chance of dying from disease: 100%.

But wait.
It gets dumber.

**[We spend 1,750 times more money](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd) causing or mopping up death than preventing it.**

## The Solution

**3 Ingredients of a World Without War and Disease**

1.  **[The 1% Treaty](brain/book/appendix/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** = Redirects 1% of military budgets globally to the Decentralized Institute of Health (DIH) Treasury.
2.  **[The Decentralized Institute of Health (DIH) Treasury](brain/book/solution/dih.qmd)** = Holds the money and uses a new system of collective budgeting called [Wishocracy](brain/book/solution/wishocracy.qmd) where everyone gets to vote on how to spend the money.
3.  **[The Decentralized FDA (dFDA)](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd)** = A new and improved FDA that ranks treatments by real-world effectiveness and enables patients to effortlessly participate in global decentralized clinical trials.

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/three-ingredients-system-diagram.qmd >}} -->

### The 1% Treaty

**Redirect \$27B/year from the War on Humanity to the War on Disease**

Every nation redirects just **1%** of their current murder budget to fund hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials that pay patients to participate.

We'd still have [\$2.69 trillion](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd) left for war and bombs and stuff.
[\$2.69 trillion is enough to murder everyone on Earth 20 times](brain/reference/nuclear-weapon-cost-and-casualties.md).
(Literally.)

<!-- ### Why Decentralization Works

<!-- {{< video assets/milton-friedman-i-pencil-free-to-choose-network-360p-h264.mp4 title="Milton Friedman - I, Pencil (Free to Choose)" >}} -->

<!-- No central planner coordinates the thousands of people required to make a pencil. The market does it automatically, efficiently, beautifully. The same principle applies to medical research: decentralized decision-making beats bureaucratic committees every time. -->

### The Decentralized Institute of Health Treasury

Instead of a committee of 200 bureaucrats picking winners, [the Decentralized Institute of Health treasury](brain/book/solution/dih.qmd) directly subsidizes patients in the dFDA marketplace, letting them choose which trials to fund.
The power of global collective intelligence decides.

### The Decentralized FDA

**Amazon for Clinical Trials + Consumer Reports for Drugs**

[The dFDA](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd) achieves [**82X cost reduction**](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) through decentralized pragmatic trials.
Patients can search treatments ranked by real-world effectiveness and join trials with one click.

**Outcome Labels: Nutrition Facts for Drugs**

Food has nutrition labels.
Cigarettes have warning labels.
Drugs have... incomprehensible 40-page inserts written by lawyers having seizures.

[The dFDA](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd) fixes that with **[Outcome Labels](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd)** - simple, data-driven summaries showing exactly what happens when real people try a treatment:

![Outcome Labels Example](assets/dfda-outcome-labels.png)

Based on thousands of real patients, you see:

- **Cognitive Improvements**: Memory +35%, Executive Function +22%
- **Side Effects**: Headache +9%, Fatigue +7%
- **The Truth**: Not marketing claims, actual measured effects from real humans

Just like nutrition labels transformed food transparency, outcome labels will transform medical transparency.
No more guessing.
No more 40-page legal documents.
Just clear data about what actually happens.

**Treatment Rankings: Consumer Reports for Drugs**

Current system: Your doctor guesses which treatment might work based on one pharma lunch presentation from 2003.

[dFDA system](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd): Type your condition, see every [treatment ranked by real-world effectiveness](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd):

## The Economics

### Investment Structure

> 📊 **VICTORY Bonds in 4 Lines:**
>
> - Investment: \$1,000 minimum
> - Target return: \$2,700 annually (270% if treaty passes)
> - Structure: 10% perpetual share of \$27 billion treaty inflows
> - Risk: High (political arbitrage), tradable on secondary markets

### Return on Investment

**463:1 ROI (Better Than Smallpox Eradication)**

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves a **463:1 return on investment**.

This means for every \$1 invested, society recieves \$463 in benefits.

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{\$463 in benefits}}{\text{\$1 invested}} = 463:1$$

This exceptional ROI comes from multiple sources:

- [**\$50B in annual R&D cost savings**](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd): 82X reduction in clinical trial costs <!-- TODO: Link broken. Was this file renamed or moved? -->
- [**840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved annually**](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model): <!-- TODO: Link broken. Was this file renamed or moved? -->
  - **Faster access to new treatments**: 200,000 QALYs from faster drug access ([2 years instead of 17 years](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) to market)
  - **Better prevention through real-world data**: 140,000 QALYs
  - **Enabling new therapies**: 500,000 QALYs from enabling new therapies for rare diseases and previously untreatable conditions

{{< include brain/figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

This ROI is better than history's greatest public health achievements like [smallpox eradication (280:1) and childhood vaccinations (13:1)](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd).
<!-- TODO: Link broken. Was this file renamed or moved? -->

### ROI With 1% Treaty Funding

**Infinite ROI (Self-Funding System)**

{{< include brain/figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

But here's the real magic: when funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**.

**Why the ROI is literally infinite** ([see full calculation](brain/book/appendix/icer-full-calculation.qmd)):

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{\$147.1B annual benefits}}{\text{\$0 new spending}} = \infty$$

Where the benefits come from:

$$\text{Total Benefit} = \underbrace{\text{\$97.1B}}_{\text{Peace Dividend}} + \underbrace{\text{\$50B}}_{\text{Health Dividend}} = \text{\$147.1B}$$

([See peace dividend calculation](brain/book/appendix/peace-dividend-analysis.qmd) | [See dFDA health benefits breakdown](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model) | [See economic impact summary](brain/book/economics/economic-impact-summary.qmd)) <!-- TODO: Multiple broken links here. -->

- **Zero net cost**: The \$27B comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **\$147.1B in annual benefits**: Peace dividend (\$97.1B) + Health dividend (\$50B)
- **Operating costs**: Only [\$290M/year](brain/book/appendix/icer-full-calculation.qmd) (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: [25,000/year](brain/book/appendix/icer-full-calculation.qmd) (875,000 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS [\$167,771](brain/book/appendix/icer-full-calculation.qmd) instead of spending

Based on the math, the dFDA/1% Treaty appears to quantifiably be the best thing anyone could do with a billion dollars.
It is a **dominant health intervention** - it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives.
No trade-off.
No charity needed.
Pure profit from preventing death.

Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates \$147 billion annually while saving 25,000 lives.

### Total Annual Benefit

**10X Bigger Than History's Best to Public Health Victories**

{{< include brain/figures/public-health-interventions-economic-benefit-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

The \$147.1 billion annual economic benefit makes this intervention nearly **10× larger than childhood vaccinations** (one of the most successful public health programs in history).
The stacked bar shows how both the peace dividend (\$97.1B) and health dividend (\$50B from dFDA R&D savings) contribute to this unprecedented scale.

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors [270% annual returns](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd).

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend \$3,500-5,500 to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually [**SAVES society \$5.87 million per life saved**](brain/book/economics/economic-impact-summary.qmd).

## Why This Will Actually Work

### The Proof Already Exists

- **🔬 Oxford Already Did It**: [The RECOVERY trial](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) proved 82X cost reduction isn't theory - it happened.
Real patients, real drugs, real results at [\$500 per patient instead of \$41,000](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd).
- **📈 Historical Precedent**: [After WW2, cutting military spending by 30% of GDP](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd) created the greatest economic boom in history.
The treaty proposes just 1%.

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y title="President Eisenhower's Farewell Address - Military-Industrial Complex Warning" >}}
- *"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed."* - President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1961
- **🌍 Switzerland's 200-Year Proof**: They spend [0.7% on defense](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd#switzerland) and have the highest quality of life on Earth ([\$93K GDP per capita](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd#switzerland)).
- **🔒 1% Less Military Spending INCREASES National Security**: Since every nation reduces by 1% simultaneously, the balance of power remains unchanged.
But now all your enemies have 1% fewer weapons pointed at you.
This acutally makes everyone MORE secure, not less.
- **🏛️ The System is Ready**:
- Legal framework: [Based on successful landmine treaty](brain/book/legal/legal-framework.qmd)
- Technology: Blockchain for transparency, AI for trial matching
- Coalition forming: Insurance companies want healthy customers, pharma wants cheaper trials
- **💰 The Money Math Works**: [Defense lobby gets \$1,813 back](brain/book/strategy/co-opting-defense-contractors.qmd) for every \$1 in lobbying.
Same economic playbook, different outcome.

## The Strategy

**How to Pass a Global Treaty in 5 Steps**

### Step 1: VICTORY Bonds

**Raise [\$1B From Investors](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**

Remember World War II?
America sold war bonds to fund the fight against fascism.
People bought them because:

1.  They hated Nazis
2.  They loved money
3.  The government made it patriotic

The strategy applies the same principle to the War on Disease.
VICTORY bonds fund the fight against death - with much higher returns than WWII bonds ever offered.

### Step 2: Global Referendum

**Get [280 Million Votes](brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd) at \$0.20-\$0.50 Each**

Get [3.5% of humanity](./brain/book/references.qmd#3-5-rule) to vote yes on "Do you want to not die?" on redirecting 1% of military spending to fund hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials.

**Why 3.5%?**
Historical research shows movements that engage [3.5% of a population](brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd) have **never failed** to achieve systemic change.
That's the tipping point.

**Viral referendum mechanics**:

- **Referral incentives**: VOTE points convertible to VICTORY bonds after treaty passage
- **Acquisition cost**: \$0.20-\$0.50 per verified vote (vs traditional \$5-15)
- **Historical benchmarks**: Change.org (\$0.20-\$0.40), Avaaz (\$0.32), EveryLibrary (\$0.56)
- **Network effects**: Referral system creates exponential growth pattern

### Step 3: Redirect Lobbying Resources

**Incentive Alignment (\$50-200M in VICTORY Bonds)**

Military-industrial lobbying returns: [\$1,813 per dollar invested](./brain/book/references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc).

The strategy [offers better returns](brain/book/strategy/co-opting-defense-contractors.qmd) to existing lobbying infrastructure:

- **Defense lobbyists**: \$5-20M in bonds (270% returns) vs current \$500K-2M salaries
- **Pension funds**: 270% returns vs market's 10% (fiduciary duty consideration)
- **Executives & board members**: Early-access bonds as strategic advisors

Outcome: Lobbying resources shift toward treaty advocacy.
Defense budgets stay at 99%.
Treaty passes through aligned incentives.

### Step 4: Super PACs With Referendum Backing

**Electoral Accountability (\$800M)**

Super PACs in every country track voting records against referendum results.
Districts voting 70% for treaty see funding flow to aligned candidates.

280M referendum voters create electoral pressure.
\$1B budget enables sustained advocacy campaigns.


### Step 5: End War and Disease

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/success-spiral-flowchart.qmd >}} -->

Gradually transcending toward a world with less and less war and more and more cures:

- **1% Treaty** (\$27B) → First major cures → Media attention → More public support
- **2% Treaty** (\$54B) → Accelerated breakthroughs → Paradigm shift → Massive momentum
- **5% Treaty** (\$135B) → Disease eradication → Victory declared → Universal support
- **50%+ Budget** → Humanity permanently prioritizes actually helping people over murdering them

## VICTORY Bonds

**Better Returns Than Cocaine Trafficking (And Slightly More Legal)**

**This is a high-risk, venture-style investment targeting 270% annual returns.
Forever.
Or until the heat death of the universe.
Whichever comes first.**

If the treaty fails, you lose your investment.
But if it fails, you'll also die.
In which case, you won't have the ability to care about the money you lost.

**Better Returns Than:**

- Medallion Fund: 39% (previous record)
- Warren Buffett: 20%
- Real Estate: 15%
- S&P 500: 10%
- Cocaine Trafficking: 90% (but risky)
- **VICTORY Bonds: 270% (and legal)**

{{< include brain/figures/victory-bonds-roi-projection-bar-chart.qmd >}}

### Investment Thesis

**How You Get 270% Returns Forever**

**The math:**

$$\text{Annual Return} = \text{\$27B} \times 10\% = \text{\$2.7B}$$

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{\$2.7B annual return}}{\text{\$1B invested}} = 270\%$$

Raise \$1B → Redirect \$27B annually → Investors get 10% of treaty inflows → \$2.7B/year forever.

### Persuading Special Interests

**Why Different Groups Support The Treaty**

- **Defense Contractors**: [270% VICTORY bond returns](brain/book/strategy/co-opting-defense-contractors.qmd) vs 8% defense margins.
Keep 99% of military budget.
Lobbyists follow the better returns.
\$50-200M in bonds redirects their advocacy.
- **Insurance Companies**: Each cure reduces billions in payouts.
Healthy customers mean higher profits.
- **Big Pharma**: Revenue model inverts.
Instead of spending \$48,000 per trial patient, DIH subsidies create positive cash flow.
Biggest expense becomes revenue stream.
- **Politicians**: Super PACs fund treaty supporters.
Voting records face 280M referendum voters.
Opposition research available for treaty opponents.
- **Billionaires**: 270% returns exceed current portfolio performance.
Early access terms available.
- **Patients**: Access to subsidized treatments through dFDA trials.
Direct voting on research priorities.

## The Cost of Delay

![Join or Die Snake](assets/join-or-die-snake.jpg)

Every day delayed:

- [410 people die unnecessarily](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd)
- [\$327 million is wasted](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd)
- Your diseases get worse
- Another round of Russian Roulette with nuclear weapons
- Politicians get even dumber somehow


<!-- {{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouRbkBAOGEw title="JFK's Moon Speech - We Choose to Go to the Moon" >}} -->

<!-- In 1962, America chose to do something "unrealistic" and "impossible." Eight years later, we walked on the Moon.

Today, we choose to cure disease. Not because it's easy, but because [150,000 people die every day](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd). -->

Historical precedent: [The Soviet Union formed, expanded globally, and collapsed within one lifetime](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd).

Digital referendum voting and 190 treaty signatures represent smaller coordination challenges than historical systemic changes.
The [463:1 ROI](#roi-with-1-treaty-funding) provides stronger economic incentives than past movements.

---

Humanity spends [**\$118.8 trillion a year**](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd) on war and disease.

The treaty redirects **1% of military budgets**.
Nations keep 99% - [enough to murder everyone in the world 19 times instead of 20](brain/reference/nuclear-weapon-cost-and-casualties.md).

The choice is binary: Continue our death march toward mutual annihilation, or redirect just 1% to help to create a world without war and disease.
