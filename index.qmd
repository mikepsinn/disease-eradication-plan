## Your 60-Second Guide to Not Dying From Stupidity

**The Problem:** [150,000 people die daily](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd) from curable diseases.
Humanity spends [\$2.7 trillion on weapons, \$68 billion on medical research](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd) (40X more on killing than curing).

**Your Goal:** Get 190 nations to sign a treaty redirecting just 1% of military budgets (\$27B/year) to fund cheaper medical trials.
[Oxford proved](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) trials can cost \$500 per patient instead of the current \$41,000 (82X cheaper).

**How You Make This Happen for \$1B:**

1.  **Sell death-prevention bonds** - You raise \$1B by offering investors 10% of the \$27B annual treaty funds forever = \$2.7B/year = 270% returns. Better than cocaine trafficking, slightly more legal.
2.  **Ask humanity if it wants to live** - You spend \$56-140M getting 280 million people to vote "yes, I'd prefer not dying" (costs \$0.20-0.50 per vote, cheaper than a gumball).
3.  **Bribe the bribers** - You give \$5-20M in bonds to defense lobbyists (270% returns beat their pathetic \$500K salaries, so they become your lobbyists).
4.  **Buy some politicians** - You spend \$800M on Super PACs. Politicians love money more than they love killing people. Usually.
5.  **Watch the treaty pass** - Politicians face 280M angry voters who want to live. Even politicians can do that math.

**Why Everyone Gets Rich From Not Dying:**

- **Defense contractors:** Keep 99% of their murder budget (\$2.67T) AND get 270% returns. They'll kill you with kindness instead.
- **Pharma companies:** Stop paying \$48K per trial patient. Patients PAY THEM instead. It's like Uber but for not dying.
- **Politicians:** Get campaign money + avoid explaining to voters why they chose bombs over grandma's cancer treatment.
- **Insurance companies:** Prefer you either dead or immortal. Anything but expensively lingering.
- **You:** Get paid to try experimental drugs + vote on which diseases to cure. Democracy, but it actually does something.

**The Math:** Every \$1 invested creates [\$463 in benefits](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd).
<!-- TODO: Link broken. Was this file renamed or moved? -->
(better than smallpox eradication's 280:1 ROI).

**Keep reading:** How Oxford proved 82X cheaper trials work, why cutting military spending historically creates economic booms, how the legal structure avoids prison, and why defense contractors actually want this.

## The Problem

### The Daily Holocaust

[150,000 people die daily](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd) from curable diseases - that's equal to [18,274 September 11 terrorist attacks](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd) per year.



![Annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)


Your body is quietly falling apart.
Your cancer cells are multiplying RIGHT NOW.
Your brain is deleting memories.
Your joints are slowly turning into gravel.
Your heart is getting tired of beating.
Your telomeres are shortening.
You are literally dissolving.

**You're a meat robot with worn-out parts.
Every one of these failures is a solvable engineering problem.**

You'd think we'd prioritize solving these problems.
You'd be adorable for thinking that.

[We haven't cured a single disease](brain/book/problem/nih-spent-1-trillion-eradicating-0-diseases.qmd) in [50 years](./brain/book/references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated).
But we have [13,000 nuclear warheads](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd), enough to end civilization 13 times, just in case the first apocalypse doesn't take.

### The Cost of War

We spend **[\$2.72 trillion](./brain/book/references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)** every year on stuff designed specifically to make humans stop being alive.

This shopping list includes:

- Nuclear bombs.
- Bullets.
- AI murder-bots.
- Invisible jets that cost more than hospitals.
- Satellites that can see your bald spot from space.
- Probably some kind of earthquake machine.

Meanwhile, we spend [\$68 billion on medical research](brain/book/reference/global-government-medical-research-spending.qmd).
That's [**40 times less**](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd) on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses.

{{< include brain/figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-1-percent-treaty-column-chart.qmd >}}

The Pentagon alone has [**lost** \$2.5 trillion](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd).
Not spent.
Lost.
Like change in a couch, except the couch is the size of Nebraska and the change could cure cancer hundreds of times over.

We have a Space Force but no Death Force.
[Your chance of dying from terrorism: 1 in 30 million](brain/book/references.qmd#terrorism-vs-disease-risk).
Your chance of dying from disease: 100%.

But wait.
It gets dumber.

**[We spend 1,750 times more money](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd) causing or mopping up death than preventing it.**

## The Solution

**3 Ingredients of a World Without War and Disease**

1.  **[The 1% Treaty](brain/book/appendix/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** = Redirects 1% of military budgets globally to the Decentralized Institute of Health (DIH) Treasury.
2.  **[The Decentralized Institute of Health (DIH) Treasury](brain/book/solution/dih.qmd)** = Holds the money and uses a new system of collective budgeting called [Wishocracy](brain/book/solution/wishocracy.qmd) where everyone gets to vote on how to spend the money.
3.  **[The Decentralized FDA (dFDA)](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd)** = A new and improved FDA that ranks treatments by real-world effectiveness and enables patients to effortlessly participate in global decentralized clinical trials.

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/three-ingredients-system-diagram.qmd >}} -->

### The 1% Treaty

**Redirect \$27B/year from the War on Humanity to the War on Disease**

Every nation redirects just **1%** of their current murder budget to fund hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials that pay patients to participate.

We'd still have [\$2.69 trillion](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd) left for war and bombs and stuff.
[\$2.69 trillion is enough to murder everyone on Earth 20 times](brain/reference/nuclear-weapon-cost-and-casualties.md).
(Literally.)

<!-- ### Why Decentralization Works

<!-- {{< video assets/milton-friedman-i-pencil-free-to-choose-network-360p-h264.mp4 title="Milton Friedman - I, Pencil (Free to Choose)" >}} -->

<!-- No central planner coordinates the thousands of people required to make a pencil. The market does it automatically, efficiently, beautifully. The same principle applies to medical research: decentralized decision-making beats bureaucratic committees every time. -->

### The Decentralized Institute of Health Treasury

Instead of a committee of 200 bureaucrats picking winners, [the Decentralized Institute of Health treasury](brain/book/solution/dih.qmd) directly subsidizes patients in the dFDA marketplace, letting them choose which trials to fund.
The power of global collective intelligence decides.

### The Decentralized FDA

**Amazon for Clinical Trials + Consumer Reports for Drugs**

[The dFDA](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd) achieves [**82X cost reduction**](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) through decentralized pragmatic trials.
Patients can search treatments ranked by real-world effectiveness and join trials with one click.

**Outcome Labels: Nutrition Facts for Drugs**

Food has nutrition labels.
Cigarettes have warning labels.
Drugs have... incomprehensible 40-page inserts written by lawyers having seizures.

[The dFDA](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd) fixes that with **[Outcome Labels](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd)** - simple, data-driven summaries showing exactly what happens when real people try a treatment:

![Outcome Labels Example](assets/dfda-outcome-labels.png)

Based on thousands of real patients, you see:

- **Cognitive Improvements**: Memory +35%, Executive Function +22%
- **Side Effects**: Headache +9%, Fatigue +7%
- **The Truth**: Not marketing claims, actual measured effects from real humans

Just like nutrition labels transformed food transparency, outcome labels will transform medical transparency.
No more guessing.
No more 40-page legal documents.
Just clear data about what actually happens.

**Treatment Rankings: Consumer Reports for Drugs**

Current system: Your doctor guesses which treatment might work based on one pharma lunch presentation from 2003.

[dFDA system](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd): Type your condition, see every [treatment ranked by real-world effectiveness](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd):

![Treatment Rankings Example](assets/dfda-comparative-effectiveness-ranking-search.png)


## The Economics

### How to Buy In Without Going to Prison

> 📊 **VICTORY Bonds Explained While Drunk:**
>
> - You put in: \$1,000 (minimum, because poor people can't save the world)
> - You get back: \$2,700/year forever (if it works)
> - How it works: You own 10% of the money river from the treaty
> - Risk level: Either you get rich or die from preventable disease anyway

### The Math That Makes Economists Cry With Joy

**463:1 ROI (Better Than Selling Kidneys, Slightly More Ethical)**

Here's what happens when you stop filling out forms and start curing people:

Every dollar spent returns \$463 in benefits. 

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{\$463 in benefits}}{\text{\$1 invested}} = 463:1$$

That's not a typo. Four hundred and sixty-three dollars. It's better returns than:
- Selling organs on the black market
- Running a casino 
- Being a pharmaceutical company
- All three combined

Where the magic money comes from:

- [**\$50B in annual R&D cost savings**](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd): 82X reduction in clinical trial costs <!-- TODO: Link broken. Was this file renamed or moved? -->
- [**840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved annually**](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model): <!-- TODO: Link broken. Was this file renamed or moved? -->
  - **Faster access to new treatments**: 200,000 QALYs from faster drug access ([2 years instead of 17 years](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) to market)
  - **Better prevention through real-world data**: 140,000 QALYs
  - **Enabling new therapies**: 500,000 QALYs from enabling new therapies for rare diseases and previously untreatable conditions

{{< include brain/figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

This ROI is better than history's greatest public health achievements like [smallpox eradication (280:1) and childhood vaccinations (13:1)](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd).
<!-- TODO: Link broken. Was this file renamed or moved? -->

### The Part Where Math Breaks

**Infinite Returns (Yes, Actually Infinite)**

{{< include brain/figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

Here's where it gets stupid in a good way:

When you redirect military money instead of asking for new money, the ROI becomes infinite.

**The kindergarten math:**

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{\$147.1B annual benefits}}{\text{\$0 new spending}} = \infty$$

Even a congressman can understand this. Probably.

**Where the \$147.1 billion comes from:**

$$\text{Total Benefit} = \underbrace{\text{\$97.1B}}_{\text{Peace Dividend}} + \underbrace{\text{\$50B}}_{\text{Health Dividend}} = \text{\$147.1B}$$

- Peace dividend: \$97.1B (from not building things that explode)
- Health dividend: \$50B (from not wasting money on paperwork)
- Total: More money than God spends on therapy

([See peace dividend calculation](brain/book/appendix/peace-dividend-analysis.qmd) | [See dFDA health benefits breakdown](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model) | [See economic impact summary](brain/book/economics/economic-impact-summary.qmd)) <!-- TODO: Multiple broken links here. -->

- **Zero net cost**: The \$27B comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **\$147.1B in annual benefits**: Peace dividend (\$97.1B) + Health dividend (\$50B)
- **Operating costs**: Only [\$290M/year](brain/book/appendix/icer-full-calculation.qmd) (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: [25,000/year](brain/book/appendix/icer-full-calculation.qmd) (875,000 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS [\$167,771](brain/book/appendix/icer-full-calculation.qmd) instead of spending

The math says this is the best thing you could do with a billion dollars.
Math is rarely wrong about money.

This is the only health trick that makes money instead of costing it.
You literally profit from preventing death.
It's capitalism's greatest achievement: making greed save lives.

Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates \$147 billion annually while saving 25,000 lives.

### Why This Beats Everything Else Humans Have Tried

**10X Better Than Vaccines (And Vaccines Are Amazing)**

{{< include brain/figures/public-health-interventions-economic-benefit-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

The \$147.1 billion annual benefit is like finding out your lottery ticket is also a cure for cancer and makes you better looking.

It's 10 times bigger than childhood vaccines, which are literally one of humanity's greatest achievements. That's like being 10 times better than pizza. Impossible, yet here we are.

**The beautiful irony:** 
- Charities: Spend \$3,500 to save a life (heroic)
- This system: MAKES \$5.87 million per life saved (capitalism's redemption arc)

You don't donate to this. You invest in it. Then you get rich while saving humanity. 

It's what Jesus would do if he understood compound interest.

## Why This Actually Works (Unlike Everything Else Humanity Has Tried)

### The Proof You're Not Delusional

- **🔬 Oxford Already Did It**: [The RECOVERY trial](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) achieved 82X cost reduction. Not in theory. In reality. With actual dying people who became not-dying people for [\$500 instead of \$41,000](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd).
- **📈 We've Done This Before**: [After WW2, we cut military spending by 30%](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd) and accidentally created the greatest economic boom in history. You're only asking for 1%. Even drunk people can spare 1%.

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y title="President Eisenhower's Farewell Address - Military-Industrial Complex Warning" >}}
- *"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed."* - President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1961
- **🌍 Switzerland's 200-Year Proof**: They spend [0.7% on defense](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd#switzerland) and have the highest quality of life on Earth ([\$93K GDP per capita](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd#switzerland)).
- **🔒 1% Less Military Spending INCREASES National Security**: Since every nation reduces by 1% simultaneously, the balance of power remains unchanged.
But now all your enemies have 1% fewer weapons pointed at you.
This acutally makes everyone MORE secure, not less.
- **🏛️ Everything You Need Already Exists**:
  - Legal framework: [Copy the landmine treaty but for disease](brain/book/legal/legal-framework.qmd)
  - Technology: The same tech that shows you ads can match you to trials
  - Natural allies: Insurance companies hate paying for sick people, pharma hates paying for trials
- **💰 The Money Math Works**: [Defense lobby gets \$1,813 back](brain/book/strategy/co-opting-defense-contractors.qmd) for every \$1 in lobbying.
Same economic playbook, different outcome.

## Your 5-Step Plan to Trick Humanity Into Survival

### Step 1: Sell Death-Prevention Bonds to Rich People

**[\$1B From People Who Like Money](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**

Remember World War II? America sold bonds to fight Nazis.
People bought them because:

1.  Nazis were bad for business
2.  4% returns were considered good back then
3.  Patriotism was trendy

You'll sell the same bonds, except:
1.  Cancer is bad for business
2.  270% returns because inflation is a thing
3.  Not dying is even trendier than patriotism

### Step 2: Ask 280 Million People If They Want to Live

**[Democracy, But Dumber](brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd)**

You need [3.5% of humanity](./brain/book/references.qmd#3-5-rule) to vote yes on this question: "Would you like to not die from preventable diseases?"

Spoiler: They'll say yes. Even Florida will say yes.

**Why 3.5%?**
Historical research shows movements that engage [3.5% of a population](brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd) have **never failed** to achieve systemic change.
That's the tipping point.

**How to make it go viral (like COVID but helpful):**

- Give people fake internet points that become real money when the treaty passes
- Cost per vote: \$0.20-\$0.50 (cheaper than a candy bar)
- Proven to work: Change.org gets signatures for \$0.20, and they're just complaining
- The pyramid scheme aspect: Everyone recruits everyone else because money

### Step 3: Bribe the People Who Bribe Congress

**The Art of the Counter-Bribe (\$50-200M)**

Defense lobbyists currently get [\$1,813 back per dollar spent bribing Congress](./brain/book/references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc).

[You offer them something better](brain/book/strategy/co-opting-defense-contractors.qmd):

- Give lobbyists \$5-20M in bonds (270% returns vs their sad \$500K salaries)
- They still keep 99% of the defense budget (enough to end the world 19 times instead of 20)
- They look like heroes instead of death merchants

It's not corruption if everyone profits from saving lives instead of ending them.

### Step 4: Buy Politicians (Legally)

**Super PACs: Bribery With Extra Steps (\$800M)**

You create Super PACs that ask one question: "Did this politician vote to cure disease or keep building bombs?"

Politicians love their jobs more than they love bombs. When 280 million voters want cures, politicians suddenly discover they've always loved cures. It's a miracle.


### Step 5: End War and Disease

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/success-spiral-flowchart.qmd >}} -->

Gradually transcending toward a world with less and less war and more and more cures:

- **1% Treaty** (\$27B) → First major cures → Media attention → More public support
- **2% Treaty** (\$54B) → Accelerated breakthroughs → Paradigm shift → Massive momentum
- **5% Treaty** (\$135B) → Disease eradication → Victory declared → Universal support
- **50%+ Budget** → Humanity permanently prioritizes actually helping people over murdering them

---

## VICTORY Bonds

**Better Returns Than Cocaine Trafficking (And Slightly More Legal)**

**This is what venture capitalists call "asymmetric risk" - you either lose your money or make 270% annually until the heat death of the universe.**

If the treaty fails, you lose your investment.
But you were going to die anyway from something preventable.
At least you'll die knowing you tried.
That's more than most people can say.

**Better Returns Than:**

- Medallion Fund: 39% (previous record)
- Warren Buffett: 20%
- Real Estate: 15%
- S&P 500: 10%
- Cocaine Trafficking: 90% (but risky)
- **VICTORY Bonds: 270% (and legal)**

{{< include brain/figures/victory-bonds-roi-projection-bar-chart.qmd >}}

### Why Rich People Will Throw Money at This

**The Beautiful Math of Greed Meeting Good**

Here's the deal you offer investors:
- They give you: \$1,000
- You give them: \$2,700/year forever

How? The treaty redirects \$27B annually. Investors get 10% of that river of money. Forever. Or until the sun explodes. Whichever comes first.

The math is so simple even hedge fund managers can understand it:

$$\text{Annual Return} = \text{\$27B} \times 10\% = \text{\$2.7B}$$

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{\$2.7B annual return}}{\text{\$1B invested}} = 270\%$$

It's like buying Manhattan for \$24 worth of beads, except legal and you're saving humanity.

### Everyone's Bribe Package (Tailored to Their Greed)

- **Defense Contractors**: "Here's 270% returns. You can keep making bombs with the other 99%. Deal?"
- **Insurance Companies**: "Dead people cost zero. Healthy people cost zero. Sick people cost billions. Do the math."
- **Big Pharma**: "Instead of paying for trials, patients pay you. It's like Uber reversed the taxi industry, but for drugs."
- **Politicians**: "Vote yes or explain to 280 million voters why you chose bombs over grandma."
- **Billionaires**: "Your portfolio returns 10%. This returns 270%. Any questions?"
- **Regular People**: "Free experimental drugs that might save your life, plus you vote on what gets cured. It's democracy but useful."

---

## Your Two Futures (Pick One)

### Door #1: Keep Doing What We're Doing

- 150,000 people continue dying daily (that's a 9/11 every 17 minutes)
- \$119 trillion keeps getting flushed down the death toilet
- You die from something we could have cured
- Military budgets grow until we're spending more on bombs than food
- Healthcare bankrupts everyone who doesn't die fast enough
- Your grandchildren ask why you didn't do anything

### Door #2: The Obviously Better Option

- 25,000 fewer people die each year (exponentially growing)
- \$147 billion generated annually (real money, not hypothetical)
- Major diseases cured within a decade
- 270% returns for early investors
- Free healthcare via trial participation
- Death becomes optional (terms and conditions apply)

## The Price of Your Procrastination

![Join or Die Snake](assets/join-or-die-snake.jpg)

**Today's Death Bill (While You Read This):**

- 410 humans deleted permanently
- \$327 million burned in inefficiency 
- Your telomeres got shorter
- Someone played nuclear weapon roulette
- A politician said something stupider than yesterday (somehow)

**Tomorrow's will be the same. And the next day. And the next.**

Until you do something about it.


<!-- {{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouRbkBAOGEw title="JFK's Moon Speech - We Choose to Go to the Moon" >}} -->

<!-- In 1962, America chose to do something "unrealistic" and "impossible." Eight years later, we walked on the Moon.

Today, we choose to cure disease. Not because it's easy, but because [150,000 people die every day](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd). -->

Historical precedent: [The Soviet Union formed, expanded globally, and collapsed within one lifetime](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd).

Digital referendum voting and 190 treaty signatures represent smaller coordination challenges than historical systemic changes.
The [463:1 ROI](#roi-with-1-treaty-funding) provides stronger economic incentives than past movements.

---

Humanity spends **\$118.8 trillion annually** on dying and killing.

You're asking to redirect **1% of just the killing budget** to the not-dying budget.

Countries keep 99% of their murder capacity - still enough to end civilization 19 times instead of 20.

**The choice is binary:** Keep marching toward expensive death, or steal 1% from the military-industrial complex and live forever.

It's not a hard choice. It's barely a choice. It's like asking "Would you like to not be punched in the face?"

Yet here we are, still choosing the face punch.
