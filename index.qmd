## The Problem

### The Daily Holocaust

[150,000 people die daily](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd) from curable diseases - that's equal to [18,274 September 11 terrorist attacks](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd) per year.

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/disease-deaths-vs-historical-events-chart.qmd >}} -->

![Annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)


Your body is quietly falling apart. Your cancer cells are multiplying RIGHT NOW. Your brain is deleting memories. Your joints are slowly turning into gravel. Your heart is getting tired of beating. Your telomeres are shortening. You are literally dissolving.

**You're a meat robot with worn-out parts. Every one of these failures is a solvable engineering problem.** 

You'd think we'd prioritize solving these problems. You'd be adorable for thinking that.

[We haven't cured a single disease](brain/book/problem/nih-spent-1-trillion-eradicating-0-diseases.qmd) in [50 years](./brain/book/references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated). But we have [13,000 nuclear warheads](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd), enough to end civilization 13 times, just in case the first apocalypse doesn't take.

### The Cost of War

We spend **[$2.72 trillion](./brain/book/references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)** every year on stuff designed specifically to make humans stop being alive.

This shopping list includes:

- Nuclear bombs. 
- Bullets. 
- AI murder-bots. 
- Invisible jets that cost more than hospitals. 
- Satellites that can see your bald spot from space. 
- Probably some kind of earthquake machine.

Meanwhile, we spend [$68 billion on medical research](brain/book/reference/global-government-medical-research-spending.qmd). That's [**40 times less**](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd) on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses.

{{< include brain/figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The Pentagon alone has [**lost** $2.5 trillion](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd). Not spent. Lost. Like change in a couch, except the couch is the size of Nebraska and the change could cure cancer hundreds of times over.

We have a Space Force but no Death Force. [Your chance of dying from terrorism: 1 in 30 million](brain/book/references.qmd#terrorism-vs-disease-risk). Your chance of dying from disease: 100%.

But wait. It gets dumber.


**[We spend 1,750 times more money](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd) causing or mopping up death than preventing it.**

## The Solution

**3 Ingredients of a World Without War and Disease**

1. **[The 1% Treaty](brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** = Redirects 1% of military budgets globally to the Decentralized Institute of Health (DIH) Treasury.
2. **[The Decentralized Institute of Health (DIH) Treasury](brain/book/solution/dih.qmd)** = Holds the money and uses a new system of collective budgeting called [Wishocracy](brain/book/solution/wishocracy.qmd) where everyone gets to vote on how to spend the money.
3. **[The Decentralized FDA (dFDA)](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd)** = A new and improved FDA that ranks treatments by real-world effectiveness and enables patients to effortlessly participate in global decentralized clinical trials.

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/three-ingredients-system-diagram.qmd >}} -->

### The 1% Treaty

**Redirect $27B/year from the War on Humanity to the War on Disease**

Every nation redirects just **1%** of their current murder budget to fund hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials that pay patients to participate.

We'd still have [$2.69 trillion](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd) left for war and bombs and stuff. [$2.69 trillion is enough to murder everyone on Earth 20 times](brain/reference/nuclear-weapon-cost-and-casualties.md). (Literally.)

<!-- ### Why Decentralization Works

<!-- {{< video assets/milton-friedman-i-pencil-free-to-choose-network-360p-h264.mp4 title="Milton Friedman - I, Pencil (Free to Choose)" >}} -->

<!-- No central planner coordinates the thousands of people required to make a pencil. The market does it automatically, efficiently, beautifully. The same principle applies to medical research: decentralized decision-making beats bureaucratic committees every time. -->

### The Decentralized Institute of Health Treasury

Instead of a committee of 200 bureaucrats picking winners, [the Decentralized Institute of Health treasury](brain/book/solution/dih.qmd) directly subsidizes patients in the dFDA marketplace, letting them choose which trials to fund. The power of global collective intelligence decides.

### The Decentralized FDA

**Amazon for Clinical Trials + Consumer Reports for Drugs**

[The dFDA](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd) achieves [**82X cost reduction**](brain/book/reference/recovery-trial.qmd) through decentralized pragmatic trials. Patients can search treatments ranked by real-world effectiveness and join trials with one click.

**Outcome Labels: Nutrition Facts for Drugs**

Food has nutrition labels. Cigarettes have warning labels. Drugs have... incomprehensible 40-page inserts written by lawyers having seizures.

[The dFDA](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd) fixes that with **[Outcome Labels](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd)** - simple, data-driven summaries showing exactly what happens when real people try a treatment:

![Outcome Labels Example](assets/dfda-outcome-labels.png)

Based on thousands of real patients, you see:
- **Cognitive Improvements**: Memory +35%, Executive Function +22%
- **Side Effects**: Headache +9%, Fatigue +7%
- **The Truth**: Not marketing claims, actual measured effects from real humans

Just like nutrition labels transformed food transparency, outcome labels will transform medical transparency. No more guessing. No more 40-page legal documents. Just clear data about what actually happens.

**Treatment Rankings: Consumer Reports for Drugs**

Current system: Your doctor guesses which treatment might work based on one pharma lunch presentation from 2003.

[dFDA system](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd): Type your condition, see every [treatment ranked by real-world effectiveness](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd):

![Treatment Rankings Example](assets/dfda-comparative-effectiveness-ranking-search.png)


## The Economics

### Quick Math for Investors

> 📊 **The Pitch in 4 Lines:**

> - You invest: $1,000
> - Annual return: $2,700 (270% forever)
> - How? You own a piece of $27 billion in redirected military spending
> - Risk? High, but if we fail, you'll probably die of preventable disease anyway

### Return on Investment

**463:1 ROI (Better Than Smallpox Eradication)**

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves a **463:1 return on investment**.

This means for every $1 invested, society recieves $463 in benefits. 


$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\$463 \text{ in benefits}}{\$1 \text{ invested}} = 463:1$$ 

This exceptional ROI comes from multiple sources:

- [**$50B in annual R&D cost savings**](brain/book/economics/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd): 82X reduction in clinical trial costs
- [**840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) saved annually**](brain/book/economics/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model):
  - **Faster access to new treatments**: 200,000 QALYs from faster drug access ([2 years instead of 17 years](brain/book/reference/recovery-trial.qmd) to market)
  - **Better prevention through real-world data**: 140,000 QALYs 
  - **Enabling new therapies**: 500,000 QALYs from enabling new therapies for rare diseases and previously untreatable conditions

{{< include brain/figures/dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

This ROI is better than history's greatest public health achievements like [smallpox eradication (280:1) and childhood vaccinations (13:1)](brain/book/economics/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd).

### ROI With 1% Treaty Funding

**Infinite ROI (Self-Funding System)**

{{< include brain/figures/treaty-dih-dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

But here's the real magic: when funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**.

**Why the ROI is literally infinite** ([see full calculation](brain/book/economics/icer-full-calculation.qmd)):

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\$147.1B \text{ annual benefits}}{\$0 \text{ new spending}} = \infty$$

Where the benefits come from:

$$\text{Total Benefit} = \underbrace{\$97.1B}_{\text{Peace Dividend}} + \underbrace{\$50B}_{\text{Health Dividend}} = \$147.1B$$

([See peace dividend calculation](brain/book/economics/peace-dividend-analysis.qmd) | [See dFDA health benefits breakdown](brain/book/economics/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd#appendix-detailed-qaly-calculation-model) | [See economic impact summary](brain/book/economics/economic-impact-summary.qmd))

- **Zero net cost**: The $27B comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **$147.1B in annual benefits**: Peace dividend ($97.1B) + Health dividend ($50B)
- **Operating costs**: Only [$290M/year](brain/book/economics/icer-full-calculation.qmd) (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: [25,000/year](brain/book/economics/icer-full-calculation.qmd) (875,000 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS [$167,771](brain/book/economics/icer-full-calculation.qmd) instead of spending

Based on the math, the dFDA/1% Treaty appears to quantifiably be the best thing anyone could do with a billion dollars.  It is a **dominant health intervention** - it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives. No trade-off. No charity needed. Pure profit from preventing death.

Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates $147 billion annually while saving 25,000 lives. 

### Total Annual Benefit

**10X Bigger Than History's Best to Public Health Victories**

{{< include brain/figures/public-health-impact-vertical-column-chart.qmd >}}

The $147.1 billion annual economic benefit makes this intervention nearly **10× larger than childhood vaccinations** (one of the most successful public health programs in history).
The stacked bar shows how both the peace dividend ($97.1B) and health dividend ($50B from dFDA R&D savings) contribute to this unprecedented scale.

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors [270% annual returns](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd).

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend $3,500-5,500 to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually [**SAVES society $5.87 million per life saved**](brain/book/economics/economic-impact-summary.qmd).

## Why This Will Actually Work

### The Proof Already Exists

**🔬 Oxford Already Did It**: [The RECOVERY trial](brain/book/reference/recovery-trial.qmd) proved 82X cost reduction isn't theory - it happened. Real patients, real drugs, real results at [$500 per patient instead of $41,000](brain/book/reference/recovery-trial.qmd).

**📈 Historical Precedent**: [After WW2, cutting military spending by 30% of GDP](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd) created the greatest economic boom in history. We're asking for just 1%.

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y title="President Eisenhower's Farewell Address - Military-Industrial Complex Warning" >}}

*"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed."* - President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1961

**🌍 Switzerland's 200-Year Proof**: They spend [0.7% on defense](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd#switzerland) and have the highest quality of life on Earth ([$93K GDP per capita](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd#switzerland)).

**🔒 1% Less Military Spending INCREASES National Security**: Since every nation reduces by 1% simultaneously, the balance of power remains unchanged. But now all your enemies have 1% fewer weapons pointed at you. This acutally makes everyone MORE secure, not less.

**🏛️ The System is Ready**:
- Legal framework: [Based on successful landmine treaty](brain/book/legal/legal-framework.qmd)
- Technology: Blockchain for transparency, AI for trial matching
- Coalition forming: Insurance companies want healthy customers, pharma wants cheaper trials

**💰 The Money Math Works**: [Defense lobby gets $1,813 back](brain/book/strategy/co-opting-defense-contractors.qmd) for every $1 in lobbying. We'll use the same playbook but for health.

## The Strategy

**How to Pass a Global Treaty in 5 Steps**

### Step 1: VICTORY Bonds

**Raise [$1B From Investors](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**

Remember World War II? America sold war bonds to fund the fight against fascism. People bought them because:

1. They hated Nazis
2. They loved money
3. The government made it patriotic

The strategy applies the same principle to the War on Disease. VICTORY bonds fund the fight against death - with much higher returns than WWII bonds ever offered.

### Step 2: Global Referendum

**Get [280 Million Votes](brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd) at $0.20-$0.50 Each**

Get [3.5% of humanity](./brain/book/references.qmd#3-5-rule) to vote yes on "Do you want to not die?" on redirecting 1% of military spending to fund hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials.

**Why 3.5%?** Historical research shows movements that engage [3.5% of a population](brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd) have **never failed** to achieve systemic change. That's the tipping point.

**How to get lots of votes**:
- **Viral referral rewards**: Vote = earn VOTE points convertible to VICTORY bonds after treaty passes
- **Cost**: $0.20-$0.50 per verified vote (vs. traditional $5-15)
- **Proven benchmarks**: Change.org ($0.20-$0.40), Avaaz ($0.32), EveryLibrary ($0.56)
- **Result**: Each voter becomes a recruiter, creating exponential growth

### Step 3: Co-Opt the Lobbying Machine

**Don't Fight Them, Hire Them ($50-200M in VICTORY Bonds)**

The military-industrial complex spends $1 on lobbying and gets [$1,813 back](./brain/book/references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc) in contracts. It's the best investment in the world, if you don't mind the screaming.

The strategy doesn't compete with them. It [**buys their lobbyists**](brain/book/strategy/co-opting-defense-contractors.qmd) with better returns:

- **Defense lobbyists**: $5-20M in bonds paying 270% vs. their current $500K-2M salary
- **Pension funds**: 270% returns vs. market's 10% (fiduciary duty *requires* accepting)
- **Executives & board members**: Early-access bonds as "strategic advisors"

Result: The most powerful lobbying apparatus in history now works FOR the treaty instead of against it. They keep 99% of their military budget. Everyone wins except death.

### Step 4: Super PACs Backed by 280M Voters

**Fund Treaty Supporters, Replace Opponents ($800M)**

Create Super PACs in every country. Not to support candidates, to support math. If your district votes 70% for the treaty and you vote against it, we fund your opponent with spreadsheets and bar graphs.

When the majority of your voters demands something and has $1B to spend, politicians either comply or get replaced.


### Step 5: End War and Disease

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/success-spiral-flowchart.qmd >}} -->

Gradually transcending toward a world with less and less war and more and more cures:

- **1% Treaty** ($27B) → First major cures → Media attention → More public support
- **2% Treaty** ($54B) → Accelerated breakthroughs → Paradigm shift → Massive momentum
- **5% Treaty** ($135B) → Disease eradication → Victory declared → Universal support
- **50%+ Budget** → Humanity permanently prioritizes actually helping people over murdering them

## VICTORY Bonds

**Better Returns Than Cocaine Trafficking (And Slightly More Legal)**

**This is a high-risk, venture-style investment targeting 270% annual returns. Forever. Or until the heat death of the universe. Whichever comes first.**

If we fail, you lose your investment. But if we fail, you'll also die.  In which case, you won't have the ability to care about the money you lost.

**Better Returns Than:**

- Medallion Fund: 39% (previous record)
- Warren Buffett: 20%
- Real Estate: 15%
- S&P 500: 10%
- Cocaine Trafficking: 90% (but risky)
- **VICTORY Bonds: 270% (and legal)**

{{< include brain/figures/victory-bonds-roi-projection-bar-chart.qmd >}}

### Investment Thesis

**How You Get 270% Returns Forever**

**The math:**

$$\text{Annual Return} = \$27B \times 10\% = \$2.7B$$

$$\text{ROI} = \frac{\$2.7B \text{ annual return}}{\$1B \text{ invested}} = 270\%$$

Raise $1B → Redirect $27B annually → Investors get 10% of treaty inflows → $2.7B/year forever.

### Persuading Special Interests

**Everyone Profits More From Cures Than Forever Wars**

**Defense Contractors**: "Wait, [I can make 270% returns](brain/book/strategy/co-opting-defense-contractors.qmd) instead of 8% margins? And keep 99% of my military budget? Where do I sign?" Don't fight their lobbyists—**buy them** with $50-200M in VICTORY bonds. Their lobbying machine becomes *your* lobbying machine.

**Insurance Companies**: Every cure = billions they don't pay out. They're literally betting on you not dying. Finally, aligned incentives!

**Big Pharma**: Here's the beautiful part. Instead of burning $48,000 per patient in trials, patients now PAY THEM (covered by DIH subsidies). From biggest expense to revenue stream. Once their business model flips to profit, **their lobbyists flip to supporting the treaty**—fiduciary duty demands it.

**Politicians**: Create Super PACs. Vote for the treaty or face opponents funded with attack ads featuring sad grandmas dying of preventable diseases (which is just called "Tuesday" right now).

**Billionaires**: 270% returns. Your current wealth becomes a rounding error.

**Poor People**: Don't die of preventable diseases (revolutionary concept)

**You**: Don't suffer and die.

**Death**: Gets fired

## Join or Die (Literally)

![Join or Die Snake](assets/join-or-die-snake.jpg)

Every day we delay:

- [410 people die unnecessarily](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd)
- [$327 million is wasted](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd)
- Your diseases get worse
- Another round of Russian Roulette with nuclear weapons
- Politicians get even dumber somehow

<!-- {{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouRbkBAOGEw title="JFK's Moon Speech - We Choose to Go to the Moon" >}} -->

<!-- In 1962, America chose to do something "unrealistic" and "impossible." Eight years later, we walked on the Moon.

Today, we choose to cure disease. Not because it's easy, but because [150,000 people die every day](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd). -->

If this seems unrealistic to you, think about the fact that [the Soviet Union was created, took over half the world, and collapsed in a single human lifetime](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd).
And Communism was a terrible idea!
Getting a lot of people to vote on a website and 190 people to sign a an agreement to implement the [quantifiably best idea in the world](#roi-with-1-treaty-funding), should be relatively trivial compared to taking over half the world. 

---

Humanity spends [**$118.8 trillion a year**](brain/book/problem/the-119-trillion-death-toilet.qmd) on war and disease.

The treaty asks for **1% of the military budget**. The military keeps 99% - [enough to murder everyone in the world 19 times instead of 20](brain/reference/nuclear-weapon-cost-and-casualties.md).

The choice is binary: Continue our death march toward mutual annihilation, or redirect just 1% to help to create a world without war and disease.
