## I. The Problem

### The $119 Trillion Death Toilet

Think of Earth as a household. A deeply disturbed household. Here's what we spend our allowance on:

#### First, the Basic Insanity: What We Spend Killing vs Curing

We spend **[$2.72 trillion](./brain/book/references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)** every year on tools designed specifically to make humans stop being alive. Nuclear bombs. Bullets. AI murder-bots. Invisible jets that cost more than hospitals. Satellites that can see your bald spot from space. Probably some kind of earthquake machine.

Meanwhile, we spend $68 billion on medical research. That's **40 times less** on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses.

{{< include brain/figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-comparison.qmd >}}

For every dollar looking for cancer treatments, we spend $40 on bullets. It's like humanity is a teenager who spends all their money on fireworks while their teeth fall out.

But wait. It gets dumber.

#### The Hidden Costs: War's Real Price Tag

{{< include brain/figures/war-hidden-direct-curing-diseases-column-chart.qmd >}}

The Pentagon alone has **lost** $2.5 trillion. Not spent. Lost. Like change in a couch, except the couch is the size of Nebraska and the change could cure cancer hundreds of times over.

When you actually use these murder tools, the real costs explode:

- Cities become parking lots (expensive to rebuild)
- Children miss school (become stupid adults)
- Hospitals explode (sick people die faster)
- Farms get poisoned (everyone gets hungry)
- Millions get PTSD (can't work, need therapy forever)
- The lucky ones just die
- The unlucky ones live with half a face

**Total true cost of war: $9.7 trillion annually.** That's enough money to give every human on Earth $1,200 just to shut up about their problems.

#### Now Add What Not Curing Diseases Actually Costs Us

{{< include brain/figures/disease-war-curing-costs-column-chart.qmd >}}

Disease doesn't just kill you. It bankrupts you first. Disease is profitable too. Not curing it, treating it. Insulin costs $300 a vial because dead diabetics don't buy insulin, but cured diabetics don't either. So we keep them barely alive. It's good business.

The global burden of disease (watching people rot + lost productivity + everyone's GoFundMe) is **$109 trillion annually**.

Add it all up: **$119 trillion per year** on death and suffering. That's more than Earth's entire GDP, somehow.

While spending **$68 billion** trying to prevent it. A rounding error. LOL.

#### The Final Stupidity Ratio: 1,750-to-1

{{< include brain/figures/disease-burden-war-curing-comparison.qmd >}}

![Figure 2: The $119 Trillion Death Toilet - Animated visualization of a golden toilet with $119 trillion in cash swirling down ($109.1T disease burden + $9.7T war costs). A tiny eyedropper labeled "$68B medical research" drips one drop while millions of dollars flush away every second.]

**We spend 1,750 times more money mopping up death than preventing it.**

| What We Buy | Annual Cost | Translation for Idiots |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Death Toilet** | | |
| Disease (watching people rot) | $109.1 Trillion | Everyone you love slowly dissolving while you pay to watch |
| War (professional murder) | $9.7 Trillion | Turning children into skeletons for fun and profit |
| **Total Death Toilet** | **$118.8 Trillion** | **More than Earth's entire GDP, somehow** |
| | | |
| **Things That Don't Kill Us** | | |
| Houses | $23.0 Trillion | Boxes to die in (at least they have WiFi) |
| Cars & Planes | $12.0 Trillion | Metal tubes to die in (but faster) |
| Food | $9.0 Trillion | Fuel for your meat robot |
| Teaching Kids | $6.0 Trillion | How to read death certificates |
| Roads & Internet | $4.0 Trillion | Infrastructure for dying while browsing |
| **Actually Curing Diseases** | **$0.068 Trillion** | **A rounding error. LOL.** |

We spend 1,745 times more money dealing with disease than curing it.

If humanity's budget was a family making $100,000/year:

- Healthcare (treating symptoms): $8,200
- Military (home defense): $2,700  
- Medical research (finding cures): **$68**

That's like buying 1,600 mops instead of fixing the burst pipe.

![Figure 3: The 1,600 Mops - Visual comparison showing one tiny wrench labeled "$68B Prevention" next to a warehouse filled with 1,600 mops labeled "$109.1T Treatment." Water gushing from a broken pipe in the background.]


### The Daily Holocaust of Inaction (Death Counter Goes Brrr)

While you read this sentence, 17 people died from preventable diseases. By the time you finish this chapter, over 150,000 will be gone. That's a small city. Deleted. Ctrl+Alt+Delete on a Cincinnati worth of humans.

Every day we delay costs:

- **$137 million** burned in inefficiency (enough to buy 274,000 PS5s)
- **2,301 Quality-Adjusted Life Years** lost (that's 2,301 years of someone's grandma)
- **150,671 people** dead from preventable disease
- While you read this paragraph: **$66,000 vanished**, someone lost a year of life

The speed of stupidity:

- Every second: $196,900 spent on war instead of cures
- Every heartbeat: Someone dies of something curable
- Every time you blink: $590,700 flushed down the death toilet

And while we're perfecting the art of long-distance murder, your body is quietly falling apart. Your cancer cells are multiplying RIGHT NOW. Your brain is deleting memories. Your joints are turning into gravel. Your heart is getting tired of beating. Your telomeres are shortening. You are literally dissolving.

You'd think we'd spend money fixing this.

You'd be adorable for thinking that.

We spend **40 times less** on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses. We haven't cured a single disease in [50 years](./brain/book/references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated). But we have enough nukes to end civilization several times over, just in case the first apocalypse doesn't take.

### Why We're Like This

Here's the beautiful part: It's profitable.

Every bomb makes someone rich. Every missile funds a yacht. Every war creates a billionaire.

Disease is profitable too. Not curing it, treating it. Insulin costs $300 a vial because dead diabetics don't buy insulin, but cured diabetics don't either. So we keep them barely alive. It's good business.

The people making money from war and disease aren't evil. They're just responding to incentives. Like trained seals, but with nuclear weapons.

### Democracy Is Already Dead (Princeton Proved It)

Oh, you think voting matters? That's adorable.

Princeton University did a study. They analyzed 1,779 policy decisions over 20 years. The correlation between what you want and what happens? 

**Zero. Percent.**

Not low. Not small. ZERO.

But when economic elites want something? They get it 78% of the time.

You have the same political influence as your houseplant. Actually less, at least politicians pretend to care about the environment.

Your "representative" has 750,000 constituents. You get 0.00013% of their attention. They spend 70% of their time fundraising from rich people who aren't you.

This isn't cynicism. It's math. You live in an oligarchy with democracy cosplay.

The math that matters:

- 0% correlation between public preference and policy outcomes
- 78% correlation when economic elites want something
- Translation: You're not a citizen. You're a spectator with a ballot.

## II. THE SOLUTION

### The Best Idea Nobody Will Ever Implement

Here's an idea so obvious a child could think of it:

Stop spending $2.72 trillion on murder and spend it on not dying instead.

PROBLEM: This makes too much sense for Earth.

### The Second-Best Idea That Might Actually Work

Take just **1%** of the murder budget. One percent. A rounding error. A Pentagon couch cushion's worth.

That's $27 billion a year.

We'd still have $2.69 trillion left for killing, enough to murder everyone on Earth 67 times. (Current population: 8 billion. Murder capacity: 535 billion. We're overachievers.)

### The Secret: Make Greed Work for Good

You can't fight human nature. But you can bribe it.

The military-industrial complex spends $1 on lobbying and gets [$1,813 back](./brain/book/references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc) in contracts. It's the best investment in the world, if you don't mind the screaming.

So we're going to do the exact same thing, but backwards.

**Step 1:** Create the [1% Treaty](./brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)—a piece of paper that says "Pretty please, spend 1% on healing instead of killing."

**Step 2:** Get 3.5% of humanity (280 million people) to vote "yes" in a **[Global Referendum](./brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd)**.

**Step 3:** Spend [$1-2.5 billion](./brain/book/economics/financial-plan.qmd) on completely legal bribes.

**Step 4:** Get every nation to sign the **[1% Treaty](./brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)**, redirecting $27 billion/year from military budgets to the **[Decentralized Institutes of Health (DIH)](./brain/book/solution/dih.qmd)**.

![Figure 5: The 4-Step Master Plan - Animated flowchart showing: Treaty document → 280 million people clicking "YES" → Money flowing to lobbyists → Politicians having sudden epiphanies about cancer with lightbulbs appearing over their heads.]

### How to Get $2 Billion from People Who Love Money

Remember World War II? America sold war bonds to fund the fight against fascism. People bought them because:

1. They hated Nazis
2. They loved money
3. Kate Smith sang at them until they cried

We're doing the same thing, but for the War on Disease. Except instead of Kate Smith, we have spreadsheets.

**[VICTORY bonds](./brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**: The most profitable way to save humanity.

![Figure 13: VICTORY Bonds Returns Comparison - Bar chart showing investment returns: Cocaine trafficking (35% but with jail bars), VICTORY bonds (40% with peace symbols), Stock market (10%), Real estate (8%), Savings account (0.5%). VICTORY bonds bar is gold and sparkles.]

We promise investors ~40% annual returns. That's better than:

- The stock market (10%)
- Real estate (8%)
- Cocaine trafficking (35%, but risky)
- Your cousin's crypto scheme (-100%)

**IMPORTANT MATH FOR CONFUSED PEOPLE:**

- VICTORY bonds: 40% annual returns for investors (that's you getting rich)
- dFDA platform: 463:1 societal ROI (that's humanity getting rich)
- Translation: You make 40% per year, society makes $463 for every $1 spent
- Everyone wins except disease and death

### The Coalition of the Willing (To Get Rich While Saving Humanity)

The military-industrial complex isn't evil. They just really, really like money. So we'll make curing cancer more profitable than building bombs.

**Defense Contractors**: "Wait, we can make 40% returns instead of 8% margins? And keep 99% of our military budget? Where do we sign?"

**Insurance Companies**: Every cure = billions they don't pay out. They're literally betting on you not dying. Finally, aligned incentives!

**Big Pharma**: Here's the beautiful part. Instead of burning $48,000 per patient in trials, patients now PAY THEM (covered by DIH subsidies). From biggest expense to revenue stream. 

**Politicians**: We create Super PACs. Vote for the treaty or we fund your opponent with bar graphs showing you hate grandmas with cancer.

**Billionaires**: Better than the Giving Pledge. 40% returns AND you get to be the founder of a $100 trillion company that ended human suffering. Your current wealth becomes a rounding error.

It's capitalism, but pointed at not dying.

## III. How It Actually Works (For Idiots)

### The 6-Step Process to Trick Humanity Into Survival

![Figure 6: The Master System Flowchart - Circular diagram showing how money flows from military budget → DIH → dFDA → Cures → Happy voters → More treaty support → Larger budget. Each step shows efficiency gains and cost reductions.]

1. **Get Money**: The 1% Treaty redirects $27B/year from military-industrial complex to medical-innovation complex
2. **Replace Soviet Science**: NIH's central planning ($48B wasted annually) → DIH's prediction markets
3. **Amazon for Trials**: dFDA creates open marketplace where treatments compete on real results, not fake studies
4. **82X Efficiency** gains drive costs from $41,000 to $500/patient (Oxford proved this works)
5. **Wisdom of Crowds**: 8 billion humans making choices beats 200 NIH bureaucrats picking winners
6. **Universal Access**: Markets reach everyone - EHR integration means one-click enrollment from your doctor's office

### What This Looks Like

![Figure 7: System Comparison - Split-screen visualization. Left side: "Current System" showing a maze of red tape, 17-year timeline, graveyards, and $2.2B price tags. Right side: "New System" showing Amazon-style interface, 2-year timeline, happy families, and $27M price tags.]

**The Current System (Stupid):**

- $2.2 billion to develop one drug
- 17 years from "eureka!" to "take two and call me"
- 95% of diseases have zero approved treatments
- 85% of patients can't join trials (too poor, too far, too sick)
- Everyone dies while waiting

**The New System (Free Market for Cures):**

- ~$27 million per treatment (markets are 80X more efficient than committees)
- 2-3 years from idea to medicine (competition accelerates everything)
- Every disease gets attention (markets find niches, committees ignore them)
- Amazon-style marketplace: browse trials, read real patient reviews, one-click join
- Your EHR automatically suggests trials that match your condition
- Treatments ranked by actual outcomes, not pharma marketing budgets
- Open-source and integrated with every health app (not FDA's walled garden)
- Fewer people die while bureaucrats debate
- So it still goes, but with less paperwork

This isn't fantasy. The [Oxford RECOVERY trial](./brain/book/reference/recovery-trial.qmd) already did this. They tested COVID treatments for $500 per patient while American trials spent $41,000 per patient on paperwork. That's an 82X cost reduction through simple efficiency.

Oxford saved a million lives. America saved a million forms.

## IV. A World That Doesn't Suck (As Much)

### Your Life in 2035 (If We Don't Screw This Up)

Two futures are racing toward us:

![Figure 8: Choose Your Own Adventure - Split timeline visualization. Left path leads to dark "Idiocracy" with mushroom clouds, bunkers, and people fighting over water. Right path leads to bright "Wishonia" with floating cities, healthy centenarians playing tennis, and children learning from holographic teachers.]

**Idiocracy (if we keep funding war) - The Three Subs:**

- 🧠 **Sub-Intelligence**: IQ dropping, education collapsed, eating lead paint for nutrients
- ⏳ **Sub-Longevity**: Life expectancy 35, dying of scurvy like a pirate
- 😢 **Sub-Wellbeing**: 80% mentally ill, constant fear, happiness is illegal
- Nuclear winter by 2050
- Diet: Bugs and bunker rations (the bugs are winning)
- Entertainment: Fighting over water (water usually wins)
- WiFi: Terrible
- Status: Mad Max but with worse teeth

**Wishonia (if we fund cures) - The Three Supers:**

- 🧠 **Super-Intelligence**: IQ unlimited, merge with AI, understand Rick & Morty
- ⏳ **Super-Longevity**: Death optional, backups available, respawn enabled
- 😊 **Super-Wellbeing**: Happiness baseline adjustable, suffering extinct, bliss on tap
- Death defeated by 2050 (it retired)
- Life expectancy: "Yes"
- Disease: In museums next to smallpox
- Poverty: Conceptually impossible
- War: "That thing where people murdered each other? Weird."
- WiFi: Telepathic
- Status: Star Trek but with better writing

Your kid gets diagnosed with something unpronounceable. 

In Idiocracy: You sell your house, start a GoFundMe, watch her die anyway.

In Wishonia: The doctor uploads her DNA, a computer designs a cure, the pharmacy prints it, she's fine by Thursday. Cost: $0. Because we stopped buying bombs.

Cancer becomes like strep throat, annoying but fixable. Alzheimer's gets deleted. Hearts get upgraded. Death becomes optional, or at least negotiable.

Your great-grandchildren will think we were barbarians. "They let people die of CANCER?" they'll say. "What, did they also drill holes in skulls for headaches?"

Yes, actually. We did that too.

### The Economics of Not Being Idiots

When we stop spending money on murder:

- Healthcare costs approach zero (no sick people = no bills)
- The $16.5 trillion we waste on violence goes to space colonies or whatever
- Humans live as long as they want (or until they get bored)
- The entire concept of "retirement" becomes weird
- Insurance companies have to find real jobs

This isn't utopia. People will still be people. We'll still have reality TV and Twitter. But at least we won't be dying of preventable diseases while building our 10,000th nuclear warhead.

---

## V. The Three Horsemen of the Inverse-Apocalypse

Before we get to the plan, here are the three systems that replace our current death-by-bureaucracy model:

### The Decentralized FDA (dFDA): Amazon for Clinical Trials + Yelp for Every Pill

The current FDA is Soviet central planning: One committee in Maryland decides what 335 million Americans can try. Takes 17 years, costs $2.2 billion, everyone dies waiting. Classic communism.

**Historical Proof This Failed**: In 1962, FDA outlawed decentralized pragmatic efficacy trials run by doctors and published in JAMA. Immediate disaster:

- New drug approvals dropped 70% overnight (whoops)
- Drug costs: $74M → $2.6B today (35X more expensive)
- Timeline: 2-3 years → 17 years to market
- Life expectancy gains slowed by more than half
- Before 1962: 144,000 doctors ran real-world trials
- After 1962: 200 bureaucrats pretending to be god

![Figure 9: dFDA Interface Mockup - Shows Amazon-style layout with treatments as "products," star ratings from real patients, filters for conditions/side effects/cost, "Add to My Treatment Plan" buttons, and integration with Apple Health showing real-time outcome tracking.]

The dFDA is Amazon meets Yelp for not dying:

- **Browse**: Search treatments like shopping - filter by success rate, side effects, cost
- **Reviews**: Read actual patient outcomes, not fake testimonials or ghostwritten studies
- **Rankings**: Treatments ranked by real-world effectiveness, updated every second
- **Integration**: Works with every EHR, health app, Fitbit - no separate login required
- **One-Click Join**: Click "Try This Treatment" from your doctor's iPad during your appointment
- **Open Source**: Anyone can build on it, unlike FDA's locked vault of hidden data
- **Competition**: Multiple trials compete for patients with better service and transparency

**The Payment Revolution (Big Pharma's Wet Dream)**:

- Old FDA trials: Pharma burns $48,000 per patient
- dFDA trials: Patients PAY pharma (covered by DIH subsidies)
- Pharma goes from biggest expense to revenue generator DURING trials
- CEOs are literally crying tears of joy (and money)

**How patients get paid to participate (Dynamic Voucher System)**:

- Researchers set prices based on trial difficulty ($100 for easy, $5,000 for invasive)
- DIH subsidies = total treaty funds ÷ participating patients
- More people join = bigger treaty = bigger subsidies for everyone
- Creates viral incentive: "Join my trial, we both get paid more!"
- Refundable deposits ensure commitment (no-shows hurt everyone's payout)

Cost per patient: $500 (competition) vs $41,000 (monopoly)
Time to results: 2 years (markets) vs 17 years (bureaucracy)
Patient access: 100% (integrated) vs 15% (gatekept)

It's literally Amazon but for cures. Same convenience, same competition, same customer obsession - but instead of buying crap you don't need, you're buying years of life.

### The DIH: Free Markets Beat Central Planning (Even in Science)

The NIH is literally Soviet science:

- A central committee of 200 reviewers pretends to know all human knowledge.
- $48 billion is allocated by politics, not results.
- A 90% rejection rate means most good ideas die in committee.
- Scientists spend 60% of their time writing grant proposals, not doing science.

The DIH replaces this broken system with a simple, market-based approach. Instead of a committee picking winners, the DIH treasury directly subsidizes patients in the dFDA marketplace, letting them choose which trials to fund.

This unleashes the power of decentralized decision-making:

- **Wisdom of Crowds**: Millions of patients and their doctors deciding is smarter than 200 bureaucrats guessing.
- **Real Competition**: The best ideas and trial designs attract patients and funding. Bad ideas wither.
- **No Gatekeepers**: If patients are willing, a trial can get funded. Data and patient demand (not politics) pick the winners.
- **Pay for Success**: Researchers are rewarded for running trials that attract patients and deliver results, not for writing grant proposals.

Think of it as:

- Y Combinator for cancer research (fund 1000 ideas, not 10)
- Kickstarter for clinical trials (patients fund what they want cured)
- Bitcoin for medical research (decentralized, transparent, uncensorable)

The NIH is Gosplan. The DIH is the NASDAQ. One killed millions through starvation. The other created trillions in wealth. Guess which model we're copying?

### Wishocracy: Democracy That Actually Works

Current democracy: 535 people in Washington pretend to represent 335 million Americans while actually representing whoever paid for their campaign.

Princeton proved it: Zero correlation between what you want and what happens. You have as much political power as your houseplant.

Wishocracy: 8 billion people make tiny decisions that add up to smart big decisions.

![Figure 11: Wishocracy Interface - Mobile app showing simple A/B choice: "Cancer Research" vs "Climate Technology" with swipe left/right mechanics like Tinder. Progress bar shows "17/20 decisions made." Background shows real-time global vote aggregation forming humanity's true priorities.]

How it works:

1. Instead of "rank these 10,000 problems," you see two: "Cancer or climate change?"
2. You pick. Takes 2 seconds.
3. Do this 20 times. Takes 5 minutes total.
4. Math happens (the good kind).
5. We get a perfect budget that reflects what humanity actually wants.
6. Your personal AI twin keeps voting your values while you sleep.

It's like Facebook figured out how to make you click on ads, but instead of selling you crap, we're curing diseases. Same psychology, better outcome.

## VI. The Plan (For Real This Time)

### Goal: Make Healing More Profitable Than Killing

**Phase 1: The Biggest Bribe in History**

Give everyone on Earth a lottery ticket to the future. Call them VOTE points. They're worthless now, but if we win, they become claims on the $16.5 trillion annual peace dividend.

It's like Bitcoin, but instead of wasting electricity, we're saving lives.

**Phase 2: The Three-Part Heist**

![Figure 12: The Three-Part Heist Visualization - Animated infographic showing: 1) Money magnetizing defense contractors to VICTORY bonds, 2) Viral spread map as votes multiply exponentially across social networks, 3) Lobbyists switching from pushing bombs to pushing cures, with briefcases changing from missiles to medicine.]

How to hijack the system that hijacked democracy:

- 💰 **VICTORY Bonds**: Turn enemies into investors
- 🗳️ **Global Referendum**: Get 280 million votes for unstoppable mandate  
- 🏛️ **Legal Bribes**: Hire their own lobbyists to push health instead of death

Get [3.5% of humanity](./brain/book/references.qmd#3-5-rule) to click "yes" on "Do you want to not die?"

(Harder than it sounds. Humans are suspicious of good ideas.)

**Phase 3: Political Jujitsu**

Create Super PACs in every country. Not to support candidates, to support math. If your district votes 70% for the treaty and you vote against it, we fund your opponent with spreadsheets and bar graphs.

Democracy, but with receipts.

**Phase 4: The Money Machine**

The $27 billion flows into specialized treasuries:

- Decentralized Institute of Mental Health (so we stop being crazy)
- Decentralized Institute of Cancer (so we stop rotting)
- Decentralized Institute of Aging (so we stop crumbling)
- Decentralized Institute of Whatever Kills You

Each one is run by direct democracy. One human, one vote. No electoral college for cancer.

**Phase 5: Victory**

We cure diseases. People stop dying of stupid things. The military-industrial complex pivots to making hospital equipment and spacecraft. Everyone makes money. Everyone lives longer.

Except mosquitoes. Screw mosquitoes.

![Figure 14: The Success Spiral - Animated spiral showing: 1% Treaty → First cures → Media coverage → More votes → 2% Treaty → More cures → 5% Treaty → Eventually spiraling up to majority of budget going to healing instead of killing. Each loop shows increasing speed and scale.]

---

## VI. The Financial Engine (Why Greedy People Should Care)

### The Math That Makes Billionaires Cry (Happy Tears)

**We're offering up to 40% annual returns.**

That's not a typo. Up to forty. Four-Zero.

Better than:

- Warren Buffett (20%)
- Index funds (10%) 
- Your cousin's crypto scheme (-100%)

**Here's how:**

- We invest $2.5 billion to redirect $27 billion annually
- That's a 10:1 ratio every year forever
- If we fully succeed, you buy a small country

**The Two-Layer Money Machine:**

- Direct Capture: $24.4B to DIH treasury (1% military budget cut)
- Societal Dividend: $92B in total economic benefit (reduced disease burden)
- We only capture 26% of the value we create
- The other 74% flows to humanity: cheaper healthcare, longer lives, more productivity
- Translation: We're giving $3 to humanity for every $1 we take

**But here's our rule:** No matter how well this works, investors never get more than half. The other half goes to actually curing diseases. Because what's the point of being rich if everyone you love is dead?

### The Bootstrap Hustle

1. Sell VICTORY bonds to rich people who fear death (all of them)
2. Use that money to legalize bribes (lobbying)
3. Get the treaty signed
4. Treaty money pays back bonds with insane returns
5. Everyone gets rich except disease and death

It's a virtuous cycle where early investors fund the lobbying that creates the treaty that generates the returns that attract more investors.

### The $100 Trillion Company

If we capture just 1% of the $118 trillion war and disease burden through efficiency gains, that's $1.18 trillion in value created annually. At standard tech valuations (10X revenue), the ecosystem we create could be worth over $10 trillion. 

That's 33 Apples. The most valuable company in history. By preventing suffering instead of causing it.

---

## VII. Why This Will Actually Work (No, Really)

### The Oxford Trial Already Proved It

The UK spent $500 per patient testing COVID treatments. Saved a million lives.

America spent $41,000 per patient on paperwork. Saved a million documents.

We're not inventing anything. We're just doing the smart thing more often.

### The Numbers Don't Lie (Unlike Politicians)

- Current cost to develop a drug: $2.2 billion
- New cost with competition: ~$27 million
- Efficiency gain: ~82X (Oxford showed 82X reduction possible)
- Lives saved: Millions annually
- Jobs lost: Zero (we redirect the same companies)
- Legal lobbying budget: $1-2.5 billion

### Everyone Wins

- Weapons manufacturers: Get paid to make medical equipment instead
- Politicians: Look like heroes, get reelected
- Pharma companies: 80X more drugs to sell
- Insurance companies: Fewer sick people to pay for
- Rich people: Get richer AND live forever
- Poor people: Don't die of preventable diseases
- You: Get to see your grandchildren graduate
- Death: Gets fired

---

## The Conclusion

Listen: Humanity spends $118.8 trillion a year on war and disease.

That's $14,850 per human per year on suffering.

We're asking for 1% of the military budget. One percent. To cure the diseases that are going to kill you, your parents, your children, and everyone you've ever loved.

The military will still have 99% of its budget. That's enough to end the world 66 times instead of 67.

This isn't liberal or conservative. It's not capitalism or socialism. It's math.

We can keep building bombs until the sun explodes, or we can cure cancer.

We can keep treating symptoms until everyone's bankrupt, or we can eliminate disease.

We can keep being the stupidest species in the universe, or we can try something else.

The people in charge aren't evil. They're just following incentives. So we're going to change the incentives. We're going to make saving lives more profitable than ending them.

---

*P.S. - If you think this is impossible, remember: We put humans on the moon using computers weaker than your phone. We split the atom. We invented cheese in a can. Surely we can figure out how to stop killing each other.*
