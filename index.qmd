> **The Mission: Redirect just 1% of global military spending to cure all diseases through hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials.**


## The Problem

### The Daily Holocaust

The number of people that die from curable diseases every year is equal to 18,274 September 11 terrorist attacks.

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/disease-deaths-vs-historical-events-chart.qmd >}} -->

![Annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)


Your body is quietly falling apart. Your cancer cells are multiplying RIGHT NOW. Your brain is deleting memories. Your joints are slowly turning into gravel. Your heart is getting tired of beating. Your telomeres are shortening. You are literally dissolving.

You'd think we'd prioritize fixing this. You'd be adorable for thinking that.

We haven't cured a single disease in [50 years](./brain/book/references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated). But we have 13,000 nuclear warheads, enough to end civilization 13 times, just in case the first apocalypse doesn't take.

### The Cost of War

We spend **[$2.72 trillion](./brain/book/references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)** every year on stuff designed specifically to make humans stop being alive.

This shopping list includes:

- Nuclear bombs. 
- Bullets. 
- AI murder-bots. 
- Invisible jets that cost more than hospitals. 
- Satellites that can see your bald spot from space. 
- Probably some kind of earthquake machine.

Meanwhile, we spend $68 billion on medical research. That's **40 times less** on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses.

{{< include brain/figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-bar-chart.qmd >}}
The Pentagon alone has **lost** $2.5 trillion. Not spent. Lost. Like change in a couch, except the couch is the size of Nebraska and the change could cure cancer hundreds of times over.

We have a Space Force but no Death Force. Your chance of dying from terrorism: 1 in 30 million. Your chance of dying from disease: 100%.

But wait. It gets dumber.


**We spend 1,750 times more money causing or mopping up death than preventing it.**

## The Solution

**How It Works in 3 Simple Steps:**
1. **Treaty** = Gets the money (1% of military budgets globally)
2. **DIH** = Holds the money (transparent treasury, no bureaucrats)  
3. **dFDA** = Spends the money (on trials that actually work, 82X cheaper)

**3 Ingredients of a World Without War and Disease**

{{< include brain/figures/three-ingredients-system-diagram.qmd >}}

### The 1% Treaty

**Redirect $27B/year from the War on Humanity to the War on Disease**

Every nation redirects just **1%** of their current murder budget to fund hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials that pay patients to participate.

We'd still have $2.69 trillion left for war and bombs and stuff. $2.69 trillion is enough to murder everyone on Earth 67 times. (Literally.)

### The DIH Treasury

Instead of a committee of 200 bureaucrats picking winners, the DIH treasury directly subsidizes patients in the dFDA marketplace, letting them choose which trials to fund. The power of global collective intelligence decides.

### The Decentralized FDA

**Amazon for Clinical Trials + Consumer Reports for Drugs**

The dFDA achieves **82X cost reduction** through decentralized pragmatic trials. Patients can search treatments ranked by real-world effectiveness and join trials with one click.

**Outcome Labels: Nutrition Facts for Drugs**

Food has nutrition labels. Cigarettes have warning labels. Drugs have... incomprehensible 40-page inserts written by lawyers having seizures.

The dFDA fixes that with **Outcome Labels** - simple, data-driven summaries showing exactly what happens when real people try a treatment:

![Outcome Labels Example](assets/dfda-outcome-labels.png)

Based on thousands of real patients, you see:
- **Cognitive Improvements**: Memory +35%, Executive Function +22%
- **Side Effects**: Headache +9%, Fatigue +7%
- **The Truth**: Not marketing claims, actual measured effects from real humans

Just like nutrition labels transformed food transparency, outcome labels will transform medical transparency. No more guessing. No more 40-page legal documents. Just clear data about what actually happens.

**Treatment Rankings: Consumer Reports for Drugs**

Current system: Your doctor guesses which treatment might work based on one pharma lunch presentation from 2003.

dFDA system: Type your condition, see every treatment ranked by real-world effectiveness:

## The Economics

### Quick Math for Investors
> 📊 **The Pitch in 4 Lines:**
> - You invest: $1,000
> - Annual return: $2,700 (270% forever)
> - How? You own a piece of $27 billion in redirected military spending
> - Risk? High, but if we fail, you'll probably die of preventable disease anyway

### Return on Investment

**463:1 ROI (Better Than Smallpox Eradication)**

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves a **463:1 return on investment**.  This means for every $1 invested, society recieves $463 in benefits. 

This exceptional ROI comes from multiple sources:

- **$50B in annual R&D cost savings**: 82X reduction in clinical trial costs
- **Faster access to new treatments**: 2 years instead of 17 years to market
- **Better prevention through real-world data**: Continuous learning from millions of patients
- **Enabling new therapies**: Making rare disease trials economically viable

{{< include brain/figures/dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

This ROI is better than history's greatest public health achievements like smallpox eradication (280:1) and childhood vaccinations (13:1).

### ROI With 1% Treaty Funding

**Infinite ROI (Self-Funding System)**

{{< include brain/figures/treaty-dih-dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

But here's the real magic: when funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**.

**Why the ROI is literally infinite** ([see full calculation](brain/book/economics/icer-full-calculation.qmd)):

- **Zero net cost**: The $27B comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **$147.1B in annual benefits**: Peace dividend ($97.1B) + R&D savings ($50B)
- **Operating costs**: Only $290M/year (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: 25,000/year (875,000 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **The math**: $147B benefit ÷ $0 new spending = ∞ (infinite ROI)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS $167,771 instead of spending

This is a **dominant health intervention**. 
This means it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives. 
Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates $147 billion annually while saving 25,000 lives. 

### Total Annual Benefit

**10X Bigger Than History's Best to Public Health Victories**

{{< include brain/figures/public-health-impact-vertical-column-chart.qmd >}}

The $147.1 billion annual economic benefit makes this intervention nearly **10× larger than childhood vaccinations** (one of the most successful public health programs in history). 
The stacked bar shows how both the peace dividend ($97.1B) and dFDA R&D savings ($50B) contribute to this unprecedented scale.

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors 270% annual returns.

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend $3,500-5,500 to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society $5.87 million per life saved**.

## Why This Will Actually Work

### The Proof Already Exists

**🔬 Oxford Already Did It**: The RECOVERY trial proved 82X cost reduction isn't theory - it happened. Real patients, real drugs, real results at $500 per patient instead of $41,000.

**📈 Historical Precedent**: After WW2, cutting military spending by 30% of GDP created the greatest economic boom in history. We're asking for just 1%.

**🌍 Switzerland's 200-Year Proof**: They spend 0.7% on defense and have the highest quality of life on Earth ($93K GDP per capita).

**🏛️ The System is Ready**: 
- Legal framework: Based on successful landmine treaty 
- Technology: Blockchain for transparency, AI for trial matching
- Coalition forming: Insurance companies want healthy customers, pharma wants cheaper trials

**💰 The Money Math Works**: Defense lobby gets $1,813 back for every $1 in lobbying. We'll use the same playbook but for health.

## The Strategy

**How to Pass a Global Treaty in 5 Steps**

{{< include brain/figures/five-step-strategy-flowchart.qmd >}}

### Step 1: VICTORY Bonds

**Raise $1B From Investors**

Remember World War II? America sold war bonds to fund the fight against fascism. People bought them because:

1. They hated Nazis
2. They loved money
3. The government made it patriotic

We're doing the same thing, but for the War on Disease. VICTORY bonds fund the fight against death - with much higher returns than WWII bonds ever offered.

### Step 2: Global Referendum

**Get 280 Million Votes**

Use the bond money to run a massive campaign. Give everyone on Earth a lottery ticket to the future. Call them VOTE points. They're worthless now, but if we win, they become claims on the $16.5 trillion annual peace dividend.

It's like Bitcoin, but instead of wasting electricity, we're saving lives.

Get [3.5% of humanity](./brain/book/references.qmd#3-5-rule) to vote yes on "Do you want to not die?" on redirecting 1% of military spending to fund hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials.

### Step 3: Legal Lobbying

**Deploy $1B (ROI: 1,813:1)**

The military-industrial complex spends $1 on lobbying and gets [$1,813 back](./brain/book/references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc) in contracts. It's the best investment in the world, if you don't mind the screaming.

We'll use the same proven lobbying ROI to build a coalition where everyone profits more from cures than disease.

### Step 4: Super PACs

**Fund Treaty Supporters, Replace Opponents**

Create Super PACs in every country. Not to support candidates, to support math. If your district votes 70% for the treaty and you vote against it, we fund your opponent with spreadsheets and bar graphs.


### Step 5: End War and Disease

{{< include brain/figures/success-spiral-flowchart.qmd >}}

Gradually moving toward a world with less and less war and more and more cures:

- **1% Treaty** ($27B) → First major cures → Media attention → More public support
- **2% Treaty** ($54B) → Accelerated breakthroughs → Paradigm shift → Massive momentum
- **5% Treaty** ($135B) → Disease eradication → Victory declared → Universal support
- **50%+ Budget** → Humanity permanently prioritizes healing over killing

## The Investment

**Targeting 270% Annual Returns for Saving Humanity**

### VICTORY Bonds

**Better Returns Than Cocaine Trafficking (And Slightly More Legal)**

**This is a high-risk, venture-style investment targeting 270% annual returns. Forever. Or until the heat death of the universe. Whichever comes first.**

Think of it as the ultimate asymmetric bet. If we fail, you lose your investment. But if we fail, you'll also die.  In which case, you won't have the ability to care about the money you lost.

Better than:

- Warren Buffett (20%)
- Index funds (10%) 
- Cocaine Trafficking (90% but risky)
- Your cousin's crypto scheme (-100%)

{{< include brain/figures/victory-bonds-roi-projection-bar-chart.qmd >}}

### Investment Thesis

**How You Get 270% Returns Forever**

{{< include brain/figures/victory-bonds-money-flow-diagram.qmd >}}

**The math:** Raise $1B → Redirect $27B annually → Investors get 10% of treaty inflows → $2.7B/year forever.

### Persuading Special Interests

**Everyone Profits More From Cures Than Forever Wars**

**Defense Contractors**: "Wait, we can make 270% returns instead of 8% margins? And keep 99% of our military budget? Where do we sign?"

**Insurance Companies**: Every cure = billions they don't pay out. They're literally betting on you not dying. Finally, aligned incentives!

**Big Pharma**: Here's the beautiful part. Instead of burning $48,000 per patient in trials, patients now PAY THEM (covered by DIH subsidies). From biggest expense to revenue stream.

**Politicians**: We create Super PACs that make their current bribes look like lunch money. Vote for the treaty or we fund your opponent with attack ads featuring sad grandmas dying of preventable diseases (which is just called "Tuesday" right now).

**Billionaires**: 270% returns. Your current wealth becomes a rounding error.

**Poor People**: Don't die of preventable diseases (revolutionary concept)

**You**: Don't suffer and die.

**Death**: Gets fired

## Join or Die (Literally)

![Join or Die Snake](assets/join-or-die-snake.jpg)

Humanity spends **$118.8 trillion a year** on war and disease.

We're asking for **1% of the military budget**. The military keeps 99% - enough to end the world 66 times instead of 67.

This isn't liberal or conservative. It's math.

The people in charge aren't evil. They just like money. So we're making saving lives more profitable than ending them.

The choice is binary: Continue our death march toward mutual annihilation, or redirect 1% toward universal flourishing.
