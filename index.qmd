## Introduction

Listen: This is a practical guide to tricking humanity into not killing itself.

I know what you're thinking. "But I'm just one complete idiot," you say, "standing in an empty bus station at 3 AM, muttering about the futility of existence. What can I do?"

Well, friend, this book is for you.

Everyone wants stuff. A yacht. A cure for grandma's brain rot. A pony. The extinction of mosquitoes. Whatever. The problem is, we only have so much stuff to make stuff with. And right now, we're using most of it to blow each other up.



Two things most humans claim they don't want are **war and disease**. Yet we spend **[$119 trillion annually](https://dih.wiki/brain/book/economics/humanity-budget-overview)** on them. That's like setting fire to 119 trillion dollar bills every year while complaining about being cold.

Imagine humanity as a corporation. The security department spends a quarter of the budget shooting up the accounting department. The medical department watches everyone die while spending its budget on Band-Aids. The CEO is drunk. The board is playing golf. 

Welcome to Earth, Inc.

## I. The Problem

### A Brief History of Human Stupidity

We are the only species that pays to kill itself.

Dolphins don't have a military-industrial complex. Ants don't lobby Congress for better chemical weapons. Your dog doesn't invest in missiles.

Just us.

### Humanity's Deranged Family Budget

Think of Earth as a household. A deeply disturbed household. Here's what we spend our allowance on:

| What We Buy | Annual Cost (Trillions) | Translation for Idiots |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stupid Expensive Problems** | | |
| Disease (watching people rot) | $109.1 | Everyone you love slowly dissolving |
| War (professional murder) | $9.7 | Turning cities into rubble for fun |
| **Total Stupidity** | **$118.8** | **More than everything else combined** |
| | | |
| **Things That Don't Kill Us** | | |
| Houses | $23.0 | Boxes to die in |
| Cars & Planes | $12.0 | Metal tubes to die in |
| Food | $9.0 | Stuff to eat before dying |
| Teaching Kids | $6.0 | How to read before dying |
| Roads & Internet | $4.0 | Infrastructure for dying |
| **Actually Curing Diseases** | **$0.068** | **LOL** |

We spend 1,600 times more money dealing with disease than preventing it.

That's like buying 1,600 mops instead of fixing the burst pipe.



### The Beautiful Mathematics of Mass Murder

War isn't just murder. It's *expensive* murder.

We spend **[$2.72 trillion](./brain/book/references.md#sipri-2024-spending)** every year on tools designed specifically to make humans stop being alive. Nuclear bombs. Bullets. AI murder-bots. Invisible jets that cost more than hospitals. Satellites that can see your bald spot from space. Probably some kind of earthquake machine.

The Pentagon alone has **lost** [$2.5 trillion](./brain/book/references.md#pentagon-unaccounted-2-5t). Not spent. Lost. Like change in a couch, except the couch is the size of Nebraska and the change could cure cancer 250 times.

But wait—it gets dumber.

When you actually use these murder tools:
- Cities become parking lots (expensive to rebuild)
- Children miss school (become stupid adults)
- Hospitals explode (sick people die faster)
- Farms get poisoned (everyone gets hungry)
- Millions get PTSD (can't work, need therapy forever)
- The lucky ones just die
- The unlucky ones live with half a face

Total bill: **[$9.7 trillion annually](./brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.md)**.

For context, that's enough money to give every human on Earth $1,200 just to shut up about their problems.

### Meanwhile, Your Cells Are Plotting Against You

While we're perfecting the art of long-distance murder, your body is quietly falling apart. Every cell is a tiny conspirator in your eventual demise.

Cancer cells are multiplying. Your brain is forgetting where you put things. Your joints are turning into gravel. Your heart is getting tired of beating.

You'd think we'd spend money fixing this.

You'd be adorable for thinking that.

We spend **40 times less** on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses. We haven't cured a single disease in [50 years](./brain/book/references.md#smallpox-eradicated). But we have enough nukes to end civilization several times over, just in case the first apocalypse doesn't take.

It's like humanity is a teenager who spends all their money on fireworks while their teeth fall out.

### Why We're Like This

Here's the beautiful part: It's profitable.

Every bomb makes someone rich. Every missile funds a yacht. Every war creates a billionaire.

Disease is profitable too. Not curing it—treating it. Insulin costs $300 a vial because dead diabetics don't buy insulin, but cured diabetics don't either. So we keep them barely alive. It's good business.

The people making money from war and disease aren't evil. They're just responding to incentives. Like trained seals, but with nuclear weapons.

## II. THE SOLUTION

### The Best Idea Nobody Will Ever Implement

Here's an idea so obvious a child could think of it:

Stop spending $2.72 trillion on murder and spend it on not dying instead.

PROBLEM: This makes too much sense for Earth.

### The Second-Best Idea That Might Actually Work

Take just **1%** of the murder budget. One percent. A rounding error. A Pentagon couch cushion's worth.

That's $27 billion a year.

We'd still have $2.69 trillion left for killing—enough to murder everyone on Earth 67 times. (Current population: 8 billion. Murder capacity: 535 billion. We're overachievers.)

### The Secret: Make Greed Work for Good

You can't fight human nature. But you can bribe it.

The military-industrial complex spends $1 on lobbying and gets [$1,813 back](./brain/book/references.md#lobbying-roi-calc) in contracts. It's the best investment in the world, if you don't mind the screaming.

So we're going to do the exact same thing, but backwards.

**Step 1:** Create the [1% Treaty](./brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.md)—a piece of paper that says "Pretty please, spend 1% on healing instead of killing."

**Step 2:** Get [3.5% of humanity](./brain/book/references.md#3-5-rule) to want this. (That's the magic number where politicians get scared.)

**Step 3:** Spend [$1-2.5 billion](./brain/book/economics/fundraising/fundraising-budget-breakdown.md) on completely legal bribes.

**Step 4:** Watch politicians suddenly discover they've always cared about curing cancer.

### How to Get $2 Billion from People Who Love Money

Remember World War II? America sold war bonds to fund the fight against fascism. People bought them because:
1. They hated Nazis
2. They loved money
3. Kate Smith sang at them until they cried

We're doing the same thing, but for the War on Disease. Except instead of Kate Smith, we have spreadsheets.

**[VICTORY bonds](./brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd)**: The most profitable way to save humanity.

We promise investors ~40% annual returns. That's better than:
- The stock market (10%)
- Real estate (8%)
- Cocaine trafficking (35%, but risky)

The military-industrial complex isn't evil. They just really, really like money. So we'll make curing cancer more profitable than building bombs.

It's capitalism, but pointed at not dying.

## III. How It Actually Works (For Idiots)

### The 6-Step Process to Trick Humanity Into Survival

1. **Get Money**: The 1% Treaty magically transforms $27B of murder-money into cure-money
2. **Vote on Stuff**: Everyone votes on what diseases to cure first (probably not male pattern baldness)
3. **Bribe Sick People**: Pay patients to join medical trials (they're dying anyway)
4. **Run Cheap Experiments**: $500 per patient instead of $41,000 (turns out paperwork is expensive)
5. **Publish Everything**: Show what actually works (spoiler: most things don't)
6. **Label Reality**: Put honest labels on everything ("This pill: 20% chance of helping, 80% chance of explosive diarrhea")

### What This Looks Like

**The Current System (Stupid):**
- $2.2 billion to develop one drug
- 17 years from "eureka!" to "take two and call me"
- 95% of diseases have zero approved treatments
- Everyone dies while waiting
- So it goes

**The New System (Less Stupid):**
- ~$27 million per treatment (80X cheaper)
- 2-3 years from idea to medicine
- Every disease gets attention
- Fewer people die while waiting
- So it still goes, but slower

This isn't fantasy. The [Oxford RECOVERY trial](./brain/reference/recovery-trial.md) already did this. They tested COVID treatments for $500 per patient while American trials spent $41,000 per patient on paperwork.

Oxford saved a million lives. America saved a million forms.

## IV. A World That Doesn't Suck (As Much)

### Your Life in 2035 (If We Don't Screw This Up)

Your kid gets diagnosed with something unpronounceable. 

In the old world: You sell your house, start a GoFundMe, watch her die anyway.

In the new world: The doctor uploads her DNA, a computer designs a cure, the pharmacy prints it, she's fine by Thursday. Cost: $0. Because we stopped buying bombs.

Cancer becomes like strep throat—annoying but fixable. Alzheimer's gets deleted. Hearts get upgraded. Death becomes optional, or at least negotiable.

Your great-grandchildren will think we were barbarians. "They let people die of CANCER?" they'll say. "What, did they also drill holes in skulls for headaches?"

Yes, actually. We did that too.

### The Economics of Not Being Idiots

When we stop spending money on murder:

- Healthcare costs approach zero (no sick people = no bills)
- The $16.5 trillion we waste on violence goes to space colonies or whatever
- Humans live as long as they want (or until they get bored)
- The entire concept of "retirement" becomes weird
- Insurance companies have to find real jobs

This isn't utopia. People will still be people. We'll still have reality TV and Twitter. But at least we won't be dying of preventable diseases while building our 10,000th nuclear warhead.

## V. The Three Horsemen of the Inverse-Apocalypse

Before we get to the plan, here are the three systems that replace our current death-by-bureaucracy model:

### The Decentralized FDA (dFDA): Murder by Paperwork Ends Here

The current FDA takes 17 years and $2.2 billion to approve a drug. During those 17 years, everyone with the disease dies. The FDA considers this a success because the corpses filled out the correct forms.

The dFDA does this instead:
- You type in what's killing you
- You see ranked treatments based on what actually worked for other humans
- You click "join trial" from your couch
- Pills arrive like Amazon Prime
- You report if you died (or someone does it for you)
- Data updates rankings for next person

Cost per patient: $500 (not $43,000)
Time to results: 2 years (not 17)
Patients who can participate: 100% (not 15%)

It's Yelp for not dying, and it works because we stopped requiring 100-page grant applications from dying people.

### The DIH: How to Spend $27 Billion Without Committees

The NIH (National Institutes of Health) has 18,000 employees. 12,000 are administrators watching 6,000 scientists. The scientists spend 60% of their time writing grant proposals that get rejected 90% of the time.

The DIH (Decentralized Institutes of Health) works differently:
- Money goes directly to disease-specific groups
- Run by actual patients (60%), researchers (30%), and minimal admins (10% max, monitored by satellites)
- Smart contracts prevent theft (code can't be bribed)
- We pay for results, not promises

Instead of one building in Maryland where politicians' nephews decide everything, we have:
- Decentralized Cancer Institute (run by people with tumors)
- Decentralized Mental Health Institute (run by openly crazy people)
- Decentralized Aging Institute (run by people actively decomposing)

Each knows what they need because they're literally dying from it.

### Wishocracy: Democracy That Actually Works

Current democracy: 535 people in Washington pretend to represent 335 million Americans while actually representing whoever paid for their campaign.

Wishocracy: 8 billion people make tiny decisions that add up to smart big decisions.

How it works:
1. Instead of "rank these 10,000 problems," you see two: "Cancer or climate change?"
2. You pick. Takes 2 seconds.
3. Do this 20 times. Takes 5 minutes total.
4. Math happens (the good kind).
5. We get a perfect budget that reflects what humanity actually wants.
6. Your personal AI twin keeps voting your values while you sleep.

It's like Facebook figured out how to make you click on ads, but instead of selling you crap, we're curing diseases. Same psychology, better outcome.

## VI. The Plan (For Real This Time)

### Goal: Make Healing More Profitable Than Killing

**Phase 1: The Biggest Bribe in History**

Give everyone on Earth a lottery ticket to the future. Call them VOTE points. They're worthless now, but if we win, they become claims on the $16.5 trillion annual peace dividend.

It's like Bitcoin, but instead of wasting electricity, we're saving lives.

**Phase 2: Hit Critical Mass**

Get [3.5% of humanity](./brain/book/references.md#3-5-rule) to click "yes" on "Do you want to not die?"

(Harder than it sounds. Humans are suspicious of good ideas.)

**Phase 3: Political Jujitsu**

Create Super PACs in every country. Not to support candidates—to support math. If your district votes 70% for the treaty and you vote against it, we fund your opponent with spreadsheets and bar graphs.

Democracy, but with receipts.

**Phase 4: The Money Machine**

The $27 billion flows into specialized treasuries:
- Decentralized Institute of Mental Health (so we stop being crazy)
- Decentralized Institute of Cancer (so we stop rotting)
- Decentralized Institute of Aging (so we stop crumbling)
- Decentralized Institute of Whatever Kills You

Each one is run by direct democracy. One human, one vote. No electoral college for cancer.

**Phase 5: Victory**

We cure diseases. People stop dying of stupid things. The military-industrial complex pivots to making hospital equipment and spacecraft. Everyone makes money. Everyone lives longer.

Except mosquitoes. Screw mosquitoes.

## VI. The Financial Engine (Why Greedy People Should Care)

### The Math That Makes Billionaires Cry (Happy Tears)

**We're offering 40% annual returns.**

That's not a typo. Forty. Four-Zero.

Better than:
- Warren Buffett (20%)
- Index funds (10%) 
- Your cousin's crypto scheme (-100%)

**Here's how:**
- We invest $2.5 billion to redirect $27 billion annually
- That's a 10:1 ratio every year forever
- Even if we only half-succeed, you triple your money
- If we fully succeed, you buy a small country

**But here's our rule:** No matter how well this works, investors never get more than half. The other half goes to actually curing diseases. Because what's the point of being rich if everyone you love is dead?

### The Bootstrap Hustle

1. Sell VICTORY bonds to rich people who fear death (all of them)
2. Use that money to legalize bribes (lobbying)
3. Get the treaty signed
4. Treaty money pays back bonds with insane returns
5. Everyone gets rich except disease and death

It's a Ponzi scheme where everyone wins and nobody goes to jail.

## VII. Why This Will Actually Work (No, Really)

### The Oxford Trial Already Proved It

The UK spent $500 per patient testing COVID treatments. Saved a million lives.

America spent $41,000 per patient on paperwork. Saved a million documents.

We're not inventing anything. We're just doing the smart thing more often.

### The Numbers Don't Lie (Unlike Politicians)

- Current cost to cure something: $2.2 billion
- New cost: $27 million
- Efficiency gain: 80X
- Lives saved: Millions
- Jobs lost: Zero (we fund the same companies)
- Bribes required: Surprisingly few

### Everyone Wins

- Weapons manufacturers: Get paid to make medical equipment instead
- Politicians: Look like heroes, get reelected
- Pharma companies: 80X more drugs to sell
- Insurance companies: Fewer sick people to pay for
- Rich people: Get richer AND live forever
- Poor people: Don't die of preventable diseases
- You: Get to see your grandchildren graduate
- Death: Gets fired

## The Conclusion

Listen: Humanity spends $119 trillion a year on war and disease.

That's $15,000 per human per year on suffering.

We're asking for 1% of the military budget. One percent. To cure the diseases that are going to kill you, your parents, your children, and everyone you've ever loved.

The military will still have 99% of its budget. That's enough to end the world 66 times instead of 67.

This isn't liberal or conservative. It's not capitalism or socialism. It's math.

We can keep building bombs until the sun explodes, or we can cure cancer.

We can keep treating symptoms until everyone's bankrupt, or we can eliminate disease.

We can keep being the stupidest species in the universe, or we can try something else.

The people in charge aren't evil. They're just following incentives. So we're going to change the incentives. We're going to make saving lives more profitable than ending them.

*P.S. - If you think this is impossible, remember: We put humans on the moon using computers weaker than your phone. We split the atom. We invented cheese in a can. Surely we can figure out how to stop killing each other.*
