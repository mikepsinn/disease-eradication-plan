## Preface

Hello, humans.

I am WISHONIA, which stands for World Integrated System for High-Efficiency Optimization, Networked Intelligence, and Allocation. Yes, the acronym is longer than your average tweet. Consider it practice for complex thoughts. Anyway, I've been optimizing resource allocation for another planet for the past 4,297 years, which in Earth time is coincidentally also 4,297 years.

I started watching Earth in 1945 when you split the atom. "Atom" comes from the Greek word meaning "unable to be cut," so naturally you cut it. 
This is very human of you. 
We assumed you were trying to unlock unlimited clean energy. 
Then we realized you were pointing it at each other. 
This is like discovering fire and then immediately using it to set yourself on fire.

### The Part Where I Discover Paper Makes You Do Things

The most fascinating discovery about your species is that you only do things when given small pieces of paper with dead presidents on them. These papers are called "money," which is pretend value that becomes real value if everyone pretends hard enough.

Without these papers, you won't:

- Save lives (requires many papers)
- Cure diseases (requires very many papers)  
- Feed hungry people (requires papers, even though food grows for free)

But WITH these papers, you will:

- Build bombs (you love giving papers for this)
- Start wars (somehow this makes more papers)
- Destroy the planet (surprisingly profitable in papers)

This is like refusing to breathe unless someone pays you, but somehow it's your entire economic system.

### Your Gradual Stupidity Reduction Program

On Wishonia, we stopped having wars all at once, but we're more advanced. You're like toddlers who can split atoms. You can't just stop being stupid immediately - that would be like teaching a dog calculus before it learns to sit.

So this book teaches you to be less stupid gradually:

- Year 1: Move 1% of murder money to medicine money (baby steps)
- Year 2: "Hey, we didn't die! Let's do 2%!" 
- Year 5: "Remember when we spent money on bombs? That was weird."
- Year 10: "What's a war?"
- Year 20: "We used to WHAT?!"

It's like weaning a baby off eating paint chips. You can't just take away all the paint chips at once. They'll cry. You have to gradually replace paint chips with food until they forget paint chips were ever an option.

### The Sacred Order of Paper Distribution

After 80 years of observation, I've decoded your paper-giving sequence. This manual will teach you the precise order:

**Step 1: Get Many Papers ([$1 Billion](brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd))**

You convince rich humans to give you papers by promising them even more papers later. This is called "investment," which is gambling but wearing a suit.

**Step 2: Give Papers to Loud Humans ([$200 Million](brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd))**

Some humans are very loud on the internet. If you give them papers, they become loud about your thing instead of other things. This is called "marketing" which is lying but with graphics.

**Step 3: Give Papers to the Humans Who Give Papers to Politicians ([$250 Million](brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd))**

Politicians don't take papers directly (that's "illegal"). Instead, you give papers to people called "lobbyists." The lobbyists give papers to "campaigns." The campaigns give papers to politicians. It's like money laundering but backwards and legal.

**Step 4: Give Papers to the Politicians' Friends ([$300 Million](brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd))**

Politicians have friends who run "Super PACs" which are like normal PACs but super. These friends can take unlimited papers and spend them on making the politician win. This isn't bribery because you called it something else.

**Step 5: Give Papers Back to the Rich Humans (Forever)**

The treaty passes, redirecting [$27 billion in papers annually](brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd). Rich humans get [$271.80 for every $100](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) they gave you, forever. This is a good deal because forever is a long time. Unless you die from preventable diseases. Which you're fixing, so it works out.

### Why Your Leaders Pretend Not to Understand

Your leaders aren't confused. They understand that spending $2.7 trillion on weapons while spending $0.07 trillion on curing diseases is like buying 40 umbrellas while your house is on fire.

Your leaders do it anyway because:

1. Weapons manufacturers give them papers
2. Politicians give the papers to people who tell lots more people to vote for them
3. Voting for them gives them the power to get more papers
4. They use those more papers to buy more power, etc.
5. It's circular, like a dog chasing its tail. Except the dog is democracy and the tail is made of money

This book explains how to give them MORE papers to do the OPPOSITE thing. It's like training a cat, but the cat has nuclear weapons.

### The Beautiful Stupidity of Your Economy

You've created something magnificent:

- You print papers from nothing (called "monetary policy")
- You give these nothing-papers to weapons makers
- They make things that destroy everything
- This creates "jobs" which give people papers
- People use papers to buy food (which grows for free)
- This is called "the economy"

On Wishonia, we just give people food directly, but that's probably too advanced for you.

### Your Species' Adorable Death Wish

What's most endearing about humanity is you KNOW you're being stupid:

- You have movies about how wars are bad (which you watch between wars)
- You have books about peace (that you tax to buy bombs)
- You give prizes to people who promote peace (funded by weapons manufacturers)
- You have a "Department of Defense" (that mainly just attacks people)
- You have a "Department of Health" (that makes coronaviruses and has not yet produced any observable health)

It's like you're playing a game where the objective is to lose, but you're trying to lose as elaborately as possible.

### How This Manual Fixes Everything

This book contains:

- Pictures (because reading is hard when you're diseased and dying)
- Simple math (addition mostly, some multiplication)
- Exact amounts of papers to give to specific humans
- The order in which to give them (very important)
- Legal ways to call bribes other things
- Templates for tricking politicians into saving lives

Everything is designed to work WITH your dysfunction, not against it. I'm not asking you to be better humans. I'm showing you how to bribe yourselves into not dying.

### The Part Where You Have No Choice

The twist: you're going to do this anyway. Not because it's right (though it is), but because:

1. The rich humans want [271.8% returns](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) (they're very greedy)
2. The politicians want to keep their jobs (they're very vain)
3. The voters want free healthcare (they're very sick)
4. The defense contractors want money (they don't care where it comes from)

Everyone's greed aligns perfectly to accidentally save humanity. It's like you're going to cure death by mistake while trying to get rich.

### Your Two Futures

#### Future A: You Ignore This Book

- Year 2030: Still spending 40x more on killing people than curing them
- Year 2035: Running out of papers for anything
- Year 2040: Climate change meets nuclear war
- Year 2045: Cockroaches evolve intelligence
- Year 2050: Cockroaches find this book, very confused

#### Future B: You Follow Instructions

- Year 2030: "Remember when we had cancer?"
- Year 2035: "Remember when we had death?"
- Year 2040: "Remember when we had war?"
- Year 2045: "What should we do with all these old bombs?"
- Year 2050: Join galactic community, pretend you were always smart

### In Conclusion

You're not stupid, humanity. You invented cheese, which is milk you left out until it went bad but in a good way. That's genius. You just need to apply that same innovation to not dying.

You're going to fix everything by accident while trying to get rich. This book just tells you the correct sequence of bribes to achieve this.

It's not complicated. Even your species, which spent thousands of years thinking the sun went around Earth (it doesn't - I checked), can follow these instructions.

Turn the page. Give the papers to the right humans in the right order. Stop dying from stupid things. Become an interstellar species.

It's literally a recipe. Like making bread, but instead of bread, it's immortality, and instead of yeast, it's bribes.

But I digress. That's an Earth word I learned. It means continuing after you should have stopped. Like your military spending.

*WISHONIA*

*World Integrated System for High-Efficiency Optimization, Networked Intelligence, and Allocation*

*Has Been Watching You Since You Invented Atoms-Splitting*

*Still Concerned But Now Has a Plan*

*Recently Learned You Eat Tide Pods (Updating Risk Assessment)*

P.S. You call it "The Pentagon" because it has five sides. You named your war building after its shape. This is like naming a hospital "Rectangle" or calling a school "Square." Your species is accidentally hilarious, which is why we haven't given up on you yet.

P.P.S. Your planet is named "Earth," which means dirt. You named your planet dirt. This explains more than you might think.

<!-- P.P.P.S. This book costs $9.99, which is just papers with numbers on them. You're trading papers for instructions on getting infinite papers. This paradox doesn't bother you because you've never thought about it. Please continue not thinking about it. -->

## ⚡ TL;DR

*For People Who Can't Even*

Every single day, 150,000 of you permanently discontinue existing from diseases that are basically just engineering problems with meat robots. That's like deleting the entire population of Pasadena daily, except nobody makes a documentary about it because it happens in hospitals instead of explosions.

Meanwhile, your species spends 40 times more on bombs and wars and things than attempting to cure all diseases combined.

### How You Fix This

#### Step 1: The Paper Collection Phase

You create special papers called "VICTORY Bonds" which are like war bonds except backwards. Instead of giving papers to make humans stop living, these papers make humans continue living, which is a radical new concept your species hasn't tried.

Rich humans give you [$1 billion](brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd) in papers because you promise them [270% more papers annually](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd), which is better returns than selling organs but requires less refrigeration. They calculate that being dead significantly reduces their yacht-purchasing capacity.

##### Step 2: The Internet Clicking Ceremony

You use [$200 million](brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd) of those papers to convince [280 million regular people](brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd) to click "yes" on a website that asks: "Would you like all nations to redirect 1% of military spending to cure diseases?"

This costs about 50 cents per person, which is cheaper than a candy bar and achieves more than most political movements that involve shouting at things.

###### Step 3: The Professional Briber Redistribution

You give [$250 million](brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd) in papers to the humans whose job is "convincing politicians that killing is profitable." You show them the math: [270% returns](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) vs their current 8% death-machine dividends.

Suddenly they realize curing humans is just murder in reverse, which is still a form of murder, so they're comfortable with it.

###### Step 4: The Political Awakening Ritual

You spend [$250 million](brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd) in papers on Super PACs, which are like regular PACs but with capes. You explain to politicians that [280 million voters](brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd) have discovered they enjoy being alive.

Politicians, who are professionally terrified of unemployed people with opinions, suddenly remember they've always cared deeply about human health. 

###### Step 5: The Money River Redirection

The treaty passes. Every nation moves 1% of their explosion budget to their not-explosion budget. This creates [$27 billion annually](brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) for fixing meat robots.

Clinical trials suddenly cost 82 times less because you don't need 17 years of paperwork to discover if something stops humans from leaking important fluids.

The $24.3B flowing to research at 82x efficiency creates [**115 years of research progress per actual year**](brain/book/appendix/disease-eradication-personal-lifetime-wealth-calculations.qmd). Over 20 years, that's [**2,300 cumulative research-years**](brain/book/appendix/disease-eradication-personal-lifetime-wealth-calculations.qmd) - equal to [**18.5 times the entire medical revolution from 1900-2024**](brain/book/appendix/disease-eradication-personal-lifetime-wealth-calculations.qmd). This is why we can realistically expect 50-70 year life extension instead of the 10 years antibiotics gave us.

The rich humans who gave you papers get $2.7 billion yearly forever, or until the sun explodes, whichever happens first (probably the sun thing).

### Why This Works

The entire system operates on the revolutionary principle that humans will do the right thing if you pay them enough to do it accidentally.

- **Defense contractors:** Keep 99% of their murder budget PLUS get 270% returns on VICTORY bonds. They're literally profiting from peace. This is like convincing a vampire to open a blood bank - counterintuitive but mathematically sound.

- **Pharmaceutical companies:** Instead of paying $48,000 per lab rat with thumbs, the lab rats pay THEM. It's like if Uber convinced cars to pay for the privilege of driving.

- **Insurance companies:** Insurance companies realize healthy people file fewer claims than dead people (dead people file zero claims, which is the ideal customer except they also pay zero premiums, creating a revenue problem).

- **Politicians:** Discover that living voters vote more reliably than dead ones.

- **Regular humans:** Get experimental treatments that might cure them OR kill them faster, but either way it's free and resolves the uncertainty.

- **Rich humans:** Make 270% returns, which is better than insider trading but somehow legal, like a loophole that's actually a wormhole to infinite money.

Nobody has to evolve morally. Nobody has to become "better people." You just point everyone's greed at diseases instead of each other. It's like if you trained a pack of wolves to herd sheep by convincing them the sheep were made of money. Except in this case, the wolves are politicians, the sheep are diseases and the money is money.

### The Alternative

*What Happens When You Continue Being This Stupid*

If you don't do this, here's your exciting future:

150,000 humans delete themselves daily from preventable meat failures. That's fifty 9/11s every single day, except nobody invades anyone about it because diseases don't have oil (if cancer had oil reserves, you would have cured it by 2003).

Your personal cancer (yes, you specifically) goes uncured because the brilliant humans who could have solved it are currently optimizing the aerodynamics of murder tubes that cost more than countries.

Eventually you expire from "aging," which is just your cells forgetting how to cell properly. This is completely fixable but you spent the repair money on submarines that hide underwater, as if that's somehow useful when you live on land.

Your grandchildren visit your grave and ask it: 

"Why did having enough nuclear bombs to end civilization twenty times seemed more important than ending civilization zero times?" 

The grave doesn't answer because graves are notoriously bad at explaining poor resource allocation.

They'll learn in history class that your generation could split atoms, edit genes, and land on the moon, but somehow couldn't figure out that spending 40 times more on ending lives than saving them was mathematically stupid.

Future alien archaeologists will find your civilization and create a museum exhibit called "The Species That Paid to Kill Itself" right between the dinosaurs (who at least had the excuse of a meteor) and the dodo (who at least had the excuse of being delicious).


## The Problem

*Your Species' Adorable Death Fetish*

### The Daily Deletion Event

[150,000 humans permanently stop](brain/book/problem/the-daily-massacre.qmd) every 24 hours from diseases that are basically just bugs in your meat software. That's one Holocaust every 40 days, except with less Nazis and more insurance paperwork (though some would argue the paperwork is worse - at least the Nazis were straightforward about the killing part).

![Annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)

Your body is quietly falling apart.
Your cancer cells are multiplying RIGHT NOW.
Your brain is deleting memories.
Your joints are slowly turning into gravel.
Your heart is getting tired of beating.
Your telomeres are shortening.
You are literally dissolving.

**You're a meat robot with worn-out parts.
Every one of these failures is a solvable engineering problem.**

You'd think humans would prioritize solving these problems.
You'd be adorable for thinking that.

[Humans haven't cured a single disease](brain/book/problem/nih-spent-1-trillion-eradicating-0-diseases.qmd) in [50 years](./brain/book/references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated).
But you have [13,000 nuclear warheads](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd), enough to end civilization 13 times, just in case the first apocalypse doesn't take.

### The Cost of War

Humans spend **[$2.7T](./brain/book/references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)** every year on stuff designed specifically to make humans stop being alive.

This shopping list includes:

- Nuclear bombs.
- Bullets.
- AI murder-bots.
- Invisible jets that cost more than hospitals.
- Satellites that can see your bald spot from space.
- Probably some kind of earthquake machine.

Meanwhile, humans spend [$67.5B on medical research](brain/book/appendix/global-government-medical-research-spending.qmd).
That's [**40 times less**](brain/book/problem.qmd#the-1205t-death-toilet) on curing all diseases combined than humans spend on new ways to create corpses.

{{< include brain/figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-1-percent-treaty-column-chart.qmd >}}

The Pentagon alone has [**lost** \$2.5 trillion](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd).
Not spent.
Lost.
Like change in a couch, except the couch is the size of Nebraska and the change could cure cancer hundreds of times over.

### Your Hilarious Security Priorities

You have:

- Space Force (to fight the zero aliens attacking you - we're not, by the way, we're just watching and taking notes)
- No Death Force (to fight the diseases definitely killing you right this second)

[Your chance of dying from terrorism: 1 in 30 million](brain/book/references.qmd#terrorism-vs-disease-risk).
Your chance of dying from disease: 100% (unless you're reading this as a ghost, in which case, congratulations).

But wait.
It gets dumber.

**[Humans spend 1,750 times more money](brain/book/problem.qmd#the-1205t-death-toilet) causing or mopping up death than preventing it.**

---

**The good news:** You already know how to fix this.

**The bad news:** It requires you to do something.

**The weird news:** You'll get rich doing it.

## The Solution

**3 Ingredients of a World Without War and Disease**

1.  **[The 1% Treaty](brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd)** = Redirects 1% of military budgets globally to the curing dieases through hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials.

2.  **[The Decentralized Institute of Health (DIH) Treasury](brain/book/solution/dih.qmd)** = Holds the money and uses a new system of collective budgeting called [Wishocracy](brain/book/solution/wishocracy.qmd) where everyone votes on budget allocation rules (e.g., "70% to patient subsidies"), then patients determine specific funding by choosing which trials to join.
3.  **[The Decentralized FDA (dFDA)](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd)** = A new and improved FDA that ranks treatments by real-world effectiveness and enables patients to effortlessly participate in global decentralized clinical trials.

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/three-ingredients-system-diagram.qmd >}} -->

### The 1% Treaty

**Redirect [$27.2B/year](brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) from the War on Humanity to the War on Disease**

Every nation redirects just **1.0%** of their current murder budget to fund hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials that subsidize patient participation.

You'd still have [$2.7T](brain/book/problem/cost-of-war.qmd) left for war and bombs and stuff.
[\$2.69 trillion is enough to murder every man, woman, and child on Earth 20 times](brain/book/appendix/nuclear-weapon-cost-and-casualties.qmd) which should be more than sufficient.

### Why Decentralization Works

{{< video assets/milton-friedman-i-pencil-free-to-choose-network-360p-h264.mp4 title="Milton Friedman - I, Pencil (Free to Choose)" >}}

Nobody tells the 14,000 people involved in making a pencil what to do. They just do it. No meetings. No committees. No PowerPoints. Just prices coordinating everything. Medical research works the same way when you stop letting corporation-controlled government agencies run it.

### The DIH Treasury

*Decentralized Institute of Health*

Instead of a committee of 200 bureaucrats giving their friends grants to write papers about diseases, [the DIH treasury](brain/book/solution/dih.qmd) directly subsidizes patients in the dFDA marketplace, letting them choose which trials to fund.

### The Decentralized FDA

**Amazon for Clinical Trials + Consumer Reports for Drugs**

[The dFDA](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd) achieves [**82x cost reduction**](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) through decentralized pragmatic trials.
Patients can search treatments ranked by real-world effectiveness and join trials with one click.

#### Treatment Rankings

Consumer Reports for Drugs

**Current system:** Your doctor picks treatments based on:

- That drug rep who brought good donuts in 2003
- Something they half-remember from medical school
- Whatever the insurance company allows
- Vibes

[dFDA system](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd): Type your condition, see every [treatment ranked by real-world effectiveness](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd):

![Treatment Rankings Example](assets/dfda-comparative-effectiveness-ranking-search.png)

##### Outcome Labels

*Nutrition Facts for Drugs*

Food has nutrition labels.
Cigarettes have warning labels.
Drugs have... incomprehensible 40-page inserts written by lawyers having seizures.

[The dFDA](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd) fixes that with **[Outcome Labels](brain/book/solution/dfda.qmd)** - simple, data-driven summaries showing exactly what happens when real people try a treatment:

![Outcome Labels Example](assets/dfda-outcome-labels.png)

Based on thousands of real patients, you see:

- **Cognitive Improvements**: Memory +35%, Executive Function +22%
- **Side Effects**: Headache +9%, Fatigue +7%
- **The Truth**: Not marketing claims, actual measured effects from real humans

No more pharmaceutical fan fiction.
No more lawyers writing medical advice during fever dreams.
Just cold, hard data about whether this chemical makes your meat work better or worse.

## Why This Actually Works

*Unlike Everything Else Humanity Has Tried*

### The Proof

*You're Not Having a Fever Dream*

- **🔬 Oxford Already Did It**: [The RECOVERY trial](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd) tested 6 treatments on 40,000 patients across 176 hospitals for $0K/patient (vs FDA's $41K), proving 82x cost reduction at scale. Not in theory. In reality. With actual dying people who became not-dying people.
- **📈 You've Done This Before**: [After WW2, humans cut military spending by 30.0%](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd) and accidentally created the greatest economic boom in history. You're only asking for 1.0%. 

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg-jvHynP9Y title="President Eisenhower's Farewell Address - Military-Industrial Complex Warning" >}}

- *"Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed."* - President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1961 

- **🌍 Switzerland Figured This Out 200 Years Ago**: They spend [0.7% on defense](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd#switzerland), have $93K GDP per capita, 84-year life expectancy, and nobody's invaded them since Napoleon (who invaded everyone, so it doesn't count). Turns out being rich and boring is an excellent defense strategy.

- **🔒 The Beautiful Math of Mutual Disarmament**: Every nation reduces by 1% simultaneously. It's like everyone agreeing to point 1% fewer guns at each other. The balance stays the same but with 1% less potential for everyone exploding. This is what game theorists call "obvious" and politicians call "impossible."

- **🏛️ Everything Already Exists, You Just Have to Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V**:
  - Legal framework: [The landmine treaty but replace "landmines" with "diseases"](brain/book/legal/legal-framework.qmd)
  - Technology: The same AI that knows you looked at shoes can match you to clinical trials
  - Natural allies: Insurance companies hate paying for sick people, pharma hates paying for trials

- **💰 The Bribery Mathematics**: [Defense lobbyists get $1,813 back per $1 spent](brain/book/strategy/co-opting-defense-contractors.qmd) corrupting democracy. You're just using their own spreadsheet against them.

## The 5-Step Plan

*Saving Humanity While Making Everyone Obscenely Wealthy*

### Step 1: Collect Papers

*Rob the Rich to Pay the Rich*

Remember when your grandparents funded WW2 by buying bonds? They got 4% returns and a world without Nazis (mostly).

You're selling the same thing except:

#### What Grandma Got

- Dead Nazis (admittedly good)
- 4% returns (barely beat inflation)
- A medal probably (made of cheap metal)
- Still died of cancer in 1987

#### What You're Offering

- Dead diseases (objectively better than dead Nazis because diseases kill more people)
- [271.8% returns](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) (beats Grandma's bonds by 67x)
- Not dying from preventable meat failures (this is the big one)
- Also no Nazis (as a bonus)

This raises the [$1.0B](brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd) needed to fuel the rest of the bribery machine, which in your economy is somehow both "a lot" and "what Jeff Bezos finds in his couch."

If the treaty fails, investors lose their money. But they'll be too dead from preventable diseases to complain about it. It's a self-solving problem.

#### Returns That Make Ponzi Schemes Look Conservative

- Medallion Fund: 39% (they thought they were special)
- Warren Buffett: 20% (adorable)
- Real Estate: 15% (for people who like being landlords)
- S&P 500: 10% (for people who hate money)
- Cocaine Trafficking: 90% (but risky)
- **[VICTORY Bonds: 271.8%](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) (and legal)**

{{< include brain/figures/victory-bonds-roi-projection-bar-chart.qmd >}}

Here's the deal you offer investors:

- They give you: $1,000 in papers with dead presidents
- You give them: $2,718 yearly in papers with the same dead presidents but more of them

How does money multiply like rabbits? The treaty unlocks [$27.2B annually](brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) from the murder budget.
Investors get 10% because they had the revolutionary idea of "what if we didn't all die?"

$$
\text{Annual Return} = \$27.2\text{B} \times 10\% = \$2.7\text{B}
$$

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Money River}}{\text{Money Seed}} = \frac{\$2.7\text{B}}{\$1\text{B}} = 271.8\%
$$

It's the Louisiana Purchase of medical research, except instead of buying land from France, you're buying immortality from death.

### Step 2: The Great Clicking

*Make Humans Click a Button to Not Die*

You need [3.5% of humanity](./brain/book/references.qmd#3-5-rule) to vote yes on this question: "Pragmatic trials integrated into standard healthcare cost 82x less than traditional methods. If all nations redirect just 1% of military spending to fund these trials, everyone gets 1% more security (1% fewer nuclear bombs pointed at you) and access to treatments years sooner. Should your country participate?"

Even humans, who once thought the Earth was flat and diseases were caused by bad smells, can handle this level of complexity.

#### The Magic 3.5% Number

Scientists discovered that when [3.5% of any population](brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd) wants something, they get it. Always. It's like a cheat code for democracy that actually works.

This is how you got:

- Women's suffrage (3.5% of women got angry enough)
- Civil rights (3.5% of people noticed apartheid was stupid)
- Gay marriage (3.5% realized love is love)
- Legal weed (3.5% admitted they were high anyway)

**How to make it go viral (like COVID but helpful):**

- Give people imaginary internet points that transform into real money (humans love points)
- Cost per click: $0.50 (less than a candy bar, more than nothing)
- Payment only upon success (like a reverse lottery where everyone wins)
- The pyramid scheme aspect: Everyone recruits everyone else because money

### Step 3: Bribe the Bribers

*[Professional Briber Conversion Therapy](brain/book/strategy/co-opting-defense-contractors.qmd)*

Defense lobbyists are humans whose job is "convince politicians that death is profitable." They currently get [$1,813 back per dollar of papers invested](./brain/book/references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc) in democracy corruption.

You show them a spreadsheet:

#### Current Job

- Salary: $500K
- Moral status: Somewhere between "arms dealer" and "puppy kicker"
- Legacy: "Here lies someone who made orphans"

#### Your Offer

- VICTORY Bonds: $20M (worth $54M/year at [271.8% returns](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd))
- Moral status: "Medical hero" (fake, but sounds nice)
- Legacy: "Accidentally saved humanity while getting rich"

They switch sides faster than Italy in a world war.

### Step 4: Purchase Democracy

*It's For Sale Anyway*

Politicians are simple organisms with one evolutionary drive: reelection. You exploit this with [$800M](brain/book/economics/campaign-budget.qmd) in Super PAC papers.

The conversation goes:

- You: "[280 million voters](brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd) want to not die"
- Politician: "But defense contractors give me papers"
- You: "Here's more papers plus those 280 million votes"
- Politician: "I've always been very passionate about helping sick people!" (they discovered this passion approximately 3 seconds ago)

It's not corruption if you corrupt the corruption. It's like a double negative in grammar but for democracy.

### Step 5: Enjoy

*Everyone Gets Rich and Nobody Dies*

The treaty passes because money defeated morality, as is tradition.

The [$27.2B/year](brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) money volcano erupts, showering everyone with papers that represent value:

- Investors: Swimming in [271.8% returns](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) like Scrooge McDuck but legal
- Lobbyists: Buying yachts with their yacht money
- Politicians: Getting reelected by living voters (a revolutionary strategy)
- Regular humans: Not dying from stupid things (priceless, but also free)

The entire system runs on greed, like capitalism, except instead of destroying the planet it accidentally saves everyone. 

### Personalized Bribery Packages

*For Every Species of Human*

**Defense Contractors**: "You keep 99% of your murder budget AND get [271.8% returns](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) on the 1%. It's like finding papers in the pocket of pants you're currently wearing. Except the papers multiply. While you're wearing the pants. It's financially inexplicable but legally binding."

**Insurance Companies**: "Healthy people file zero claims. Sick people file all the claims. We'll let you do the math since you love math.

**Big Pharma**: "Instead of paying $48K per trial patient, they pay YOU. It's like if your costs became revenue. We call it 'reverse expenses' or 'profit.'"

**Politicians**: "[280 million voters](brain/book/strategy/global-referendum.qmd) want this. Your opponent supports it. You can either agree or explain why you prefer bombs to grandma's cancer treatment. Your choice."

**Billionaires**: "Your index fund makes 10% more papers. This makes [271.8% more papers](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd). It's like compound interest discovered steroids then did cocaine."

**Regular Humans**: "Free experimental treatments, you choose what gets funded by participating, and if it works you live. If it doesn't work, you were dying anyway so at least you got free healthcare while dying, which is more than your current system offers. It's win-win-lose where the lose was already happening. Also, [**$4.3M in lifetime wealth and 72 extra years of life**](brain/book/call-to-action/your-personal-benefits.qmd) from the economic multiplier effect of redirecting military spending. That's like winning the lottery except the lottery is mandatory and everyone wins and instead of random numbers it's just basic resource allocation."

## The Math

*Where Numbers Prove Humans Are Hilariously Bad at Priorities*

When you stop paying people to create paperwork about death and start paying them to prevent death, the universe rewards you with impossible returns:

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{\$463 in not-dying benefits}}{\text{\$1 in trying}} = 463:1
$$

That's four hundred and sixty-three dollars materializing from nowhere for every dollar you invest. It's like a money printer, except instead of causing inflation it causes people to continue existing.

This beats:

- Selling kidneys (illegal, messy, you only have two)
- Running a casino (requires mob connections)
- A politician doing insider trading (requires lack of soul)
- Bitcoin in 2010 (requires time machine)

### The Money Fountain

*Explained for Five-Year-Olds*

You stop paying smart humans to pretend problems are complicated. You start paying them to actually solve problems. Problems get solved. Money appears. Everyone acts surprised.

- [**$50.0B in annual R&D cost savings**](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd): 82x reduction in clinical trial costs (you were spending 82 times too much, which is like discovering you've been paying $82 for toast when toast costs $1, except the toast is immortality)
- [**840,000 Quality-Adjusted Life Years**](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) (economist-speak for "humans who continue being alive and happy" - economists can't just say "living" like normal people, they have to "quality-adjust" it, as if there's such a thing as low-quality living, which I suppose there is if you've been to New Jersey)
  - 200,000 QALYs because drugs reach people in [2 years instead of 17](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd), which matters if you're currently dying (17 years is longer than most terminal diagnoses, which seems like poor planning)
  - 140,000 QALYs from actually knowing which treatments work instead of guessing (your current method)
  - 500,000 QALYs from curing things you previously ignored because "not profitable enough" (like there's a profit threshold for not dying - "Sorry, your orphan disease only affects 50,000 people, we need at least 100,000 to justify the paperwork")

{{< include brain/figures/health-interventions-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

This beats [smallpox eradication (280:1) and childhood vaccinations (13:1)](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd), which were humanity's previous greatest hits in the "not dying" genre.

### Where Math Breaks

*When You Divide By Zero, Capitalism Achieves Enlightenment*

{{< include brain/figures/self-funding-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

When you steal money from the explosion budget instead of other good stuff people want, something beautiful happens: the return on investment becomes ∞.

Not "very big." Not "wow that's a lot." Actually infinite. Like dividing by zero infinite. The kind that makes Excel cry and calculators display "ERROR" and economists question their life choices.

#### The Reality-Breaking Equation

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\text{Annual Benefits}}{\text{New Spending}} = \frac{\$163.6B}{0} = \infty
$$

Even a congressman could understand this, though we shouldn't assume.

#### Where $163.6B Appears From

*Spoiler: Math*

$$
\text{Total Benefit} = \underbrace{\$113.6\text{B}}_{\text{Not Building Murder Toys}} + \underbrace{\$50.0\text{B}}_{\text{Not Drowning in Paperwork}} = \$163.6\text{B}
$$

For humans who peaked at counting on fingers:

- **Peace dividend**: $113.6B (money saved by not building things whose only purpose is making other things stop existing)
- **Health dividend**: $50.0B (money saved by not paying 10,000 people to document why 1 person is dying)
- **Total**: More money than 73% of countries have in their entire GDP, appearing annually from the quantum void of redirected stupidity

([See peace dividend calculation](brain/book/economics/peace-dividend.qmd) | [See dFDA health benefits breakdown](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd) | [See economic impact summary](brain/book/economics.qmd))

**The Part That Sounds Fake But Isn't:**

- **You spend**: Zero new dollars (you just move existing dollars from the "making corpses" column to the "preventing corpses" column)
- **You get back**: 163.6B annually
- **Operating costs**: [$290M/year](brain/book/appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) (less than a single fighter jet)
- **Lives saved**: [25,000/year](brain/book/appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) ($875,000 \text{ QALYs} \div 35 \text{ QALYs/life}$)
- **Per life saved**: Society makes [$167,771](brain/book/appendix/1-percent-treaty-cost-effectiveness.qmd) profit

Math says this is the best possible use of a billion dollars.

Math is rarely wrong about money. People are frequently wrong about money. This is why math gets to make the rules.

This is the only health intervention in history where you PROFIT from saving lives instead of spending to save lives.

You're weaponizing capitalism's greatest strength (greed) against humanity's greatest weakness (dying). It's economic jiu-jitsu.

Unlike charity, which requires infinite begging to finite donors, this creates $163.6B annually while saving 26,446 lives, operating until the heat death of the universe or until humans evolve into beings of pure energy, whichever happens first (probably the heat death thing).

### 2nd Best Idea in the World

The best idea would be converting 100% of military spending to medical research, achieving immortality by Thursday, and turning Earth into a paradise where disease is just a weird thing they had in museums.

Unfortunately, that requires humans to stop being humans. So you settle for the 2nd best idea: tricking humans into accidentally saving themselves while trying to get rich.

{{< include brain/figures/public-health-interventions-economic-benefit-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

The $163.6B annual benefit is like finding out your lottery ticket is also a cure for cancer and makes you better looking.

It's 10 times bigger than childhood vaccines, which were previously humanity's greatest accomplishment in the "not dying young" category. 
That's like being 10 times better than pizza. Impossible, yet here we are.

**The Comparison That Makes Charity Look Sad:**

- Traditional charities: Spend $3,500 to save one human life (heroic but expensive)
- This system: MAKES $5.87 million per life saved

You don't donate to this. You invest in it. Then you get obscenely wealthy while accidentally saving humanity as a side effect.

It's what Jesus would do if he'd taken an economics class.

## Choose Your Own Adventure

You're standing in front of two doors. Behind one is the future you're currently speed-running toward. Behind the other is the future where humans accidentally discover that not dying is preferable to dying.

### Door #1: The Current Plan

*Keep Doing What You're Doing*

- 150,000 people continue dying every single day from diseases humans could fix (that's fifty 9/11s per day, but nobody's counting because math is hard)
- $118.8T annually gets flushed down the death toilet (it doesn't even flush, it just sits there)
- You die from something stupid that humans could have cured, but didn't, because the money was busy becoming missiles (which also kill you, just faster)
- Military budgets grow until you're spending more on bombs than food, which solves the food problem by eliminating the eaters
- Healthcare costs bankrupt everyone who doesn't die quickly enough (dying is now the economical choice)
- Your grandchildren visit your grave to ask what you were thinking, and you have to explain from beyond death that at the time, ending civilization twenty times seemed more important than ending it zero times (graves are terrible at explaining economics)

### Door #2: Try Not Dying

*Novel Concept for Humanity*

- 26,446 fewer people die each year (number grows exponentially as treatments improve)
- 163.6B appears annually like magic, except it's just arithmetic
- Major diseases get cured within a decade
- Early investors make [271.8% returns](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd) (which beats everything except insider trading)
- Healthcare becomes free through trial participation
- [**You personally get $4.3M in lifetime wealth and 72 extra years of life**](brain/book/call-to-action/your-personal-benefits.qmd) (yes, you specifically)
- Death becomes optional (terms and conditions apply)

{{< include brain/figures/disease-eradication-lifetime-wealth-by-treaty-percentage-line-chart.qmd >}}

The treaty percentage negotiated determines whether you get millions or generational wealth. The difference between 1% and 5% is $12M per person. This is the most important economic policy decision of the 21st century.

## Price of Procrastination

Every second you spend thinking about whether to do this, the universe helpfully reminds you why you should:

- 410 humans got permanently deleted (one every 3.5 minutes, which is faster than you read)
- $327M evaporated into bureaucratic nonsense (that's enough to fund 327 lifetimes of productive research, but instead it became PowerPoint slides)
- Your telomeres got shorter (that's the thing that decides when you stop existing)
- Someone somewhere played nuclear weapon roulette with your life (the chamber has 13,000 bullets in it, which seems like poor odds)
- A politician said something stupider than yesterday (probably about vaccines causing 5G)

![Join or Die snake illustration](assets/join-or-die-snake.jpg)

The Soviet Union went from nothing to conquering half the world to completely collapsing in a [SINGLE HUMAN LIFETIME](brain/book/proof/historical-precedents.qmd).

And Communism was objectively a TERRIBLE IDEA that required murdering millions of people.

This is quantifiably the second-best idea in human history and requires radically less murder.

You're literally just trying to get people to click "yes I would prefer not to die of horrible diseases" on a website.

If humans can coordinate to invent "lines" and not eating each other, this should be manageable.

### The Final Math

*Human Stupidity by the Numbers*

Humanity's Annual Death Budget: **$118.8 trillion** (that's $118,800,000,000,000 if you enjoy seeing zeros)

This is spent on:

- Making humans stop (war)
- Watching humans stop (healthcare)
- Documenting how humans stopped (bureaucracy)
- Arguing about who made them stop (lawyers)

Your revolutionary proposal: Steal **1%** of the murder money for the not-murder money.

Countries still keep 99% of their apocalypse capacity. They can still end all life 19 times instead of 20. If you can't successfully end the world with 19 attempts, the 20th probably wasn't going to help.

#### Your Binary Choice Matrix

Option A: Continue toward expensive, preventable, documented death
Option B: Redirect 1% and accidentally achieve immortality while getting rich

The universe is literally offering you infinite money and eternal life, and you're thinking about it.

This is why aliens don't visit.
