## I. The Problem

**We Spend $119 Trillion Annually on Death While Spending 0.06% on Cures**

### The Death Toilet

**$119 Trillion Annually Flushed Down Humanity's Death Toilet**

Think of Earth as a household. A deeply disturbed household. Here's what we spend our allowance on:

#### War on Humanity vs War on Disease

We spend **[$2.72 trillion](./brain/book/references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)** every year on tools designed specifically to make humans stop being alive. Nuclear bombs. Bullets. AI murder-bots. Invisible jets that cost more than hospitals. Satellites that can see your bald spot from space. Probably some kind of earthquake machine.

Meanwhile, we spend $68 billion on medical research. That's **40 times less** on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses.

{{< include brain/figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-bar-chart.qmd >}}

But wait. It gets dumber.

#### Hidden Costs of War

**Collateral Idiocy of War**

The Pentagon alone has **lost** $2.5 trillion. Not spent. Lost. Like change in a couch, except the couch is the size of Nebraska and the change could cure cancer hundreds of times over. The Pentagon loses more money than exists in most countries.

 We have a Space Force but no Death Force. Your chance of dying from terrorism: 1 in 30 million. Your chance of dying from disease: 100%.

When you actually use these murder tools, the real costs explode:

- Cities become parking lots (expensive to rebuild)
- Children miss school (become stupid adults)
- Hospitals explode (sick people die faster)
- Farms get poisoned (everyone gets hungry)
- Millions get PTSD (can't work, need therapy forever)
- The lucky ones just die
- The unlucky ones live with half a face

{{< include brain/figures/war-hidden-direct-curing-diseases-column-chart.qmd >}}

**Total true cost of war: $9.7 trillion annually.** That's enough money to give every human on Earth $1,200 just to shut up about their problems.


#### Total Cost of Idiocy

**The $119 Trillion Death Toilet**

Disease doesn't just kill you. It bankrupts you first. The global burden of disease is **$109 trillion annually**. Add war's $9.7 trillion. Total: **$119 trillion per year** flushed down the death toilet.

    DeathToilet -.->|"1,750x more"| Research
```

**We spend 1,750 times more causing or mopping up death than preventing it.** If humanity's budget was a family making $100,000/year, we'd spend $8,200 on healthcare, $2,700 on home defense, and **$68** on actually finding cures. That's like buying 1,600 mops instead of fixing the burst pipe.

{{< include brain/figures/disease-vs-curing-costs-column-chart.qmd >}}

#### Death And Suffering Are Optional

You might say $109 trillion worth of disease is unavoidable. Fortunately, you'd be completely wrong.

**Death is not a law of nature. It's a mechanical failure we haven't figured out how to fix yet.**

Your body is a self-repairing biological machine:
- Software: DNA
- Hardware: Organs
- Self-repair: 330 billion new cells daily

**We're already fixing you:** Hot-swapping hearts like power supplies. 3D-printing titanium skulls. CRISPR literally debugs human source code with find-and-replace.

**Animals that solved death while we built bombs:** Hydras (immortal), naked mole rats (cancer-proof), bowhead whales (200+ years).

Harvard reversed aging in mice. The same biological principles apply to humans.


### 150,000 Die Daily From Preventable Diseases

**While We Build Skynet**

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/disease-deaths-vs-historical-events-chart.qmd >}} -->

![Comparison of annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)

While you read this sentence, 17 people died from preventable diseases. By the time you finish this chapter, over 150,000 will be gone. That's a small city. Deleted. Ctrl+Alt+Delete on a Cincinnati worth of humans.

Every day we delay costs:

- **$137 million** burned in inefficiency (enough to buy 274,000 PS5s)
- **2,301 Quality-Adjusted Life Years** lost (that's 2,301 years of someone's grandma)
- **150,671 people** dead from preventable disease
- While you read this paragraph: **$66,000 vanished**, someone lost a year of life

The speed of stupidity:

- Every second: $196,900 spent on war instead of cures
- Every heartbeat: Someone dies of something curable
- Every time you blink: $590,700 flushed down the death toilet

And while we're perfecting the art of long-distance murder, your body is quietly falling apart. Your cancer cells are multiplying RIGHT NOW. Your brain is deleting memories. Your joints are turning into gravel. Your heart is getting tired of beating. Your telomeres are shortening. You are literally dissolving.

Yet we don't prioritize fixing this.

We haven't cured a single disease in [50 years](./brain/book/references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated). But we have enough nukes to end civilization several times over, just in case the first apocalypse doesn't take.

### Why This System Persists

**Greed and Evolution Keep the Death Machine Running**

Here's the brutal truth: Every one of us, from the most powerful president to the lowliest pauper, is doomed to a life of gradually escalating suffering until it ends in catastrophe.  

We are all prisoners to this moronic system. This system made sense in a world of scarcity when we were hitting each other with rocks over the last berry bush. Kill or be killed. Hoard or starve. Trust no one outside your tribe.

But now? We live in a world of abundance and nuclear weapons. We can feed everyone twice over, but we'd rather burn grain to keep prices high. We can cure diseases, but we'd rather sell treatments forever. The software running human civilization is 10,000 years out of date, and the bugs are literally killing us.

Why don't we update the software? Why do we cling to a system designed for cave-dwelling murderers when we could be immortal space wizards?

Here's the ugly answer: It's profitable.

Every bomb makes someone rich. Every missile funds a yacht. Every war creates a billionaire.

Disease is profitable too. Not curing it, treating it. Insulin costs $300 a vial because dead diabetics don't buy insulin, but cured diabetics don't either. So we keep them barely alive. It's good business.

The people making money from war and disease aren't evil. They just like money. We can't change human nature, but we can create economic systems that make curing people more profitable than killing them.

### Democracy Cannot Fix This

Princeton [analyzed 1,779 policy decisions](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf) over 20 years. Correlation between what you want and what happens? **Zero percent.**

When economic elites want something? 78% success rate.

![](assets/bill-public-support-vs-chance-of-adoption-what-actually-happens.png)

Your "representative" has 750,000 constituents. You get 0.00013% of their attention. They spend 70% of their time fundraising from people who aren't you. You have the same political influence as your houseplant. Actually less - politicians pretend to care about the environment.

This isn't cynicism. It's math. You live in an oligarchy with democracy cosplay.

But there's another way to change the world: **Make doing the right thing more profitable than doing the wrong thing.**

## II. The Solution

**3 Ingredients of a World Without War and Disease**

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    subgraph "The 3 Ingredients"
        Treaty["🌍 Ingredient 1: The 1% Treaty<br/>Redirect $27B from military<br/>to medical<br/>Every nation contributes"]

        DIH["💰 Ingredient 2: DIH Treasury<br/>Market-based funding<br/>Patients choose trials<br/>Wishocracy governance"]

        dFDA["🛒 Ingredient 3: Decentralized FDA<br/>Amazon for Clinical Trials + Consumer Reports for Drugs<br/>$500 vs $41,000<br/>per patient"]
    end

    Treaty --> DIH
    DIH --> dFDA
    dFDA --> Results["✨ Results<br/>• 82X cost reduction<br/>• 17 years → 2 years<br/>• 100% patient access<br/>• Millions of lives saved"]
```

### Ingredient 1: The 1% Treaty

**Redirect $27B From Military to Medical**

Every nation redirects just **1%** of their current murder budget to a Decentralized Institute of Health (DIH) that will pay for sick people to participate in super-efficient decentralized clinical trials.

We'd still have $2.69 trillion left for everyone.  $2.69 trillion is enough to murder everyone on Earth 67 times. (Literally.)

### Ingredient 2: The DIH Treasury

**Markets Replace NIH Committees**

The NIH: Where good ideas go to fill out forms until they die of old age. It's literally Soviet science:

- A central committee of 200 reviewers pretends to know all human knowledge
- $48 billion is allocated by politics, not results
- A 90% rejection rate means most good ideas die in committee
- Scientists spend 60% of their time begging for money like Victorian orphans instead of doing science

The DIH replaces this broken system with a simple, market-based approach. Instead of a committee picking winners, the DIH treasury directly subsidizes patients in the dFDA marketplace, letting them choose which trials to fund.

This unleashes the power of decentralized decision-making:

- **Wisdom of Crowds**: Millions of patients and their doctors deciding is smarter than 200 bureaucrats guessing.
- **Real Competition**: The best treatments attract patients and funding.
- **No Gatekeepers**: If patients are willing, a trial can get funded. Data and patient demand (not politics) pick the winners.
- **Pay for Success**: Researchers are rewarded for running trials that attract patients and deliver results, not for writing grant proposals.

#### How Patients Get Paid

**The Dynamic Voucher System**

- Researchers set prices based on trial difficulty ($100 for easy, $5,000 for invasive)
- DIH subsidies = total treaty funds ÷ participating patients
- More people join = bigger treaty = bigger subsidies for everyone
- Creates viral incentive: "Join my trial, we both get paid more!"
- Refundable deposits ensure commitment (no-shows hurt everyone's payout)

#### Wishocracy: Preventing Capture

**Protecting the $24.3B From Special Interests**

Remember how democracy got captured by special interests? The military-industrial complex? Big Pharma? Yeah, we're not letting that happen again with the DIH's $27 billion annual budget.

**The Problem**: After we pay back the 10% to investors (the oligarchy that made this all possible), we still have $24.3 billion per year. Without safeguards, lobbyists and special interests will swarm like vultures. Within 5 years, the DIH would become just another captured institution funneling money to whoever has the best K Street connections.

**The Solution**: Wishocracy - where everyone votes on DIH budget allocation, preventing capture.

![Wishocracy Public Budget Voting Example](assets/wishocracy-slider.png)

**How it protects the $24.3B from capture**:

1. **Anyone can propose projects**: Patient subsidies, trial infrastructure, expanding to a 2% treaty - all competing for funding
2. **Everyone votes through pairwise comparisons**: "Fund Alzheimer's trials" vs "Build trial infrastructure in Africa?" Simple choices, not 10,000-item ballots
3. **Mathematical aggregation prevents gaming**: Can't buy 51% of votes when there are 8 billion voters
4. **Real-time transparency**: Every allocation is public.

**Why this matters**: Investors who funded this deserve their 10% returns. But the remaining 90% must serve humanity, not special interests.

Without Wishocracy, the DIH becomes another captured institution.

### Ingredient 3: The Decentralized FDA

**Amazon for Clinical Trials + Consumer Reports for Drugs**

The current FDA is Soviet central planning: One committee in Maryland decides what 335 million Americans can try. Takes 17 years, costs $2.2 billion, everyone dies waiting.

**Historical Proof This Failed**: In 1962, FDA outlawed decentralized pragmatic efficacy trials run by doctors and published in JAMA. Immediate disaster:

- New drug approvals dropped 70% overnight (whoops)
- Drug costs: $74M → $2.6B today (35X more expensive)
- Timeline: 2-3 years → 17 years to market
- Life expectancy gains slowed by more than half
- Before 1962: 144,000 doctors ran real-world trials
- After 1962: 200 bureaucrats pretending to be god

![](assets/black-box-model-animation.gif)

The dFDA is Amazon meets Consumer Reports for not dying:

- **Treatment Rankings**: Enter your condition and see all treatments ranked by real-world effectiveness
- **One-Click Join**: Click "Try This Treatment" from your doctor's iPad during your appointment
- **Open Source**: Anyone can use it or build on it

**The Payment Revolution**:

- Old Standard NIH/FDA trials: Pharma burns $48,000 per patient
- dFDA trials: Patients PAY pharma (covered by DIH subsidies)
- Pharma goes from biggest expense to revenue generator DURING trials
- CEOs are literally crying tears of joy (and money)

### dFDA vs Current System

- **Cost per patient**: $500 vs $41,000
- **Time to results**: 2 years vs 17 years
- **Patient access**: 100% (universal access) vs 15% (gatekept)

    FDA5 -.->|"82X Efficiency Gain"| dFDA5
```

It's literally Amazon but for cures. Same convenience, same competition, same customer obsession - but instead of buying crap you don't need, you're buying years of life.

**Outcome Labels: Nutrition Facts for Drugs**

Food has nutrition labels. Cigarettes have warning labels. Drugs have... incomprehensible 40-page inserts written by lawyers having seizures.

The dFDA fixes that with **Outcome Labels** - simple, data-driven summaries showing exactly what happens when real people try a treatment:

![Outcome Labels Example](assets/dfda-outcome-labels.png)

Based on thousands of real patients, you see:
- **Cognitive Improvements**: Memory +35%, Executive Function +22%
- **Side Effects**: Headache +9%, Fatigue +7%
- **The Truth**: Not marketing claims, actual measured effects from real humans

Just like nutrition labels transformed food transparency, outcome labels will transform medical transparency. No more guessing. No more 40-page legal documents. Just clear data about what actually happens.

**Treatment Rankings: Consumer Reports for Drugs**

Current system: Your doctor guesses which treatment might work based on one pharma lunch presentation from 2003.

dFDA system: Type your condition, see every treatment ranked by real-world effectiveness:

![Treatment Rankings Example](assets/dfda-comparative-effectiveness-ranking-search.png)

Search "Alzheimer's" and instantly see:
- **Lecanemab**: 92% effectiveness (FDA approved)
- **Donanemab**: 88% effectiveness (Phase 3)
- **Aducanumab**: 76% effectiveness (FDA approved)
- **Experimental options**: See Phase 2 trials you can join today

Each treatment shows:
- Real-world effectiveness scores from actual patients
- Approval status (FDA approved, Phase 3, Phase 2, experimental)
- One-click access to available trials
- Side effect profiles and outcome labels

Stop guessing. Start knowing. It's Google meets Amazon meets "please don't let me die."

## III. The Proof

**Oxford Already Achieved 82X Cost Reduction**

### The Oxford RECOVERY Trial

**$500 vs FDA's $41,000 Per Patient**

The UK spent $500 per patient testing COVID treatments. Saved a million lives.

America spent $41,000 per patient on paperwork. Saved a million documents.

We're not inventing anything. We're just doing the smart thing more often.

### The Math

**How Competition Creates 82X Efficiency Gains**

- Current cost to develop a drug: $2.2 billion
- New cost with competition: ~$27 million
- Efficiency gain: ~82X (Oxford showed 82X reduction possible)
- Lives saved: Millions annually
- Jobs lost: Zero (we redirect the same companies)
- Legal lobbying budget: $1 billion

So we know it works. Oxford proved competition beats monopoly by 82:1. Now let's talk about what this means for your wallet.

## IV. The Economics

**Why This Is the Most Profitable Investment in History**

This isn't charity. This is the best investment opportunity in human history. Here's why:

### The dFDA Alone

**463:1 ROI (Better Than Smallpox Eradication)**

{{< include brain/figures/dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

The dFDA alone achieves a **463:1 return on investment**—better than history's greatest public health achievements like smallpox eradication (280:1) and childhood vaccinations (13:1).

This exceptional ROI comes from multiple sources:
- **$50B in annual R&D cost savings**: 82X reduction in clinical trial costs
- **Faster access to new treatments**: 2 years instead of 17 years to market
- **Better prevention through real-world data**: Continuous learning from millions of patients
- **Enabling new therapies**: Making rare disease trials economically viable

### With Treaty Funding

**Infinite ROI (Self-Funding System)**

{{< include brain/figures/treaty-dih-dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

But here's the real magic: when funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**.

**Why the ROI is literally infinite** ([see full calculation](brain/book/economics/icer-full-calculation.qmd)):
- **Zero net cost**: The $27B comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **$147.1B in annual benefits**: Peace dividend ($97.1B) + R&D savings ($50B)
- **Operating costs**: Only $290M/year (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: 25,000/year (875,000 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **The math**: $147B benefit ÷ $0 new spending = ∞ (infinite ROI)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS $167,771 instead of spending

This is a **dominant health intervention**—the only one in history that simultaneously saves money AND saves lives. Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates $147 billion annually while saving 25,000 lives. It's what happens when you redirect money from destroying life to creating it.

### 10X Bigger Than History's Best

**Comparing to Public Health Victories**

{{< include brain/figures/public-health-impact-horizontal-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The $147.1 billion annual economic benefit makes this intervention nearly **10× larger than childhood vaccinations**—one of the most successful public health programs in history. The stacked bar shows how both the peace dividend ($97.1B) and dFDA R&D savings ($50B) contribute to this unprecedented scale.

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors 270% annual returns.

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend $3,500-5,500 to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society $5.87 million per life saved**. This isn't charity—it's the most profitable intervention in human history.

## V. The Future

**Your Kid Gets Cancer in 2050**

**Option A (Status Quo):** You sell your house, start a GoFundMe, watch her die anyway. Life expectancy: 35. Diet: Bugs. WiFi: Terrible. Mad Max but with worse teeth.

**Option B (With 1% Treaty):** Doctor uploads her DNA, computer designs cure, pharmacy prints it, she's fine by Thursday. Cost: $0. Life expectancy: "Yes." Disease: In museums next to smallpox.

Your great-grandchildren will think we were barbarians. "They let people die of CANCER?" they'll say. "What, did they also drill holes in skulls for headaches?"

Yes, actually. We did that too.

## VI. The Strategy

**How to Pass a Global Treaty in 5 Steps**

```{mermaid}

    Step1["📊 Step 1: Global Referendum<br/>Get 280M votes<br/>(3.5% of humanity)<br/>VOTE points as future claims"]

    Step5["🎯 Step 5: Treaties Pass<br/>1% → 2% → 5% → Victory<br/>Diseases fall,<br/>humanity rises"]

    Step1 --> Step2
    Step2 --> Step3
    Step3 --> Step4
    Step4 --> Step5
    Step5 -.->|"Success Spiral"| Step1
```

### Step 1: Global Referendum

**Get 280 Million Votes**

Give everyone on Earth VOTE points - future claims on the $16.5 trillion annual peace dividend if we succeed.

Get [3.5% of humanity](./brain/book/references.qmd#3-5-rule) to vote yes on redirecting 1% of military spending to fund hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials.

### Step 2: VICTORY Bonds

**Raise $1B From Investors**

Similar to World War II bonds that funded the fight against fascism, VICTORY bonds fund the fight against disease - but with much higher returns.

### Step 3: Legal Lobbying

**Deploy $1B (ROI: 1,813:1)**

The military-industrial complex spends $1 on lobbying and gets [$1,813 back](./brain/book/references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc) in contracts. It's the best investment in the world, if you don't mind the screaming.

We'll use the same proven lobbying ROI to build a coalition where everyone profits more from cures than disease.

### Step 4: Super PACs

**Fund Treaty Supporters, Replace Opponents**

Create Super PACs in every country. Not to support candidates, to support math. If your district votes 70% for the treaty and you vote against it, we fund your opponent with spreadsheets and bar graphs.


### Step 5: End War and Disease

Each successful treaty level creates a positive feedback loop:
- **1% Treaty** ($27B) → First major cures → Media attention → More public support
- **2% Treaty** ($54B) → Accelerated breakthroughs → Paradigm shift → Massive momentum
- **5% Treaty** ($135B) → Disease eradication → Victory declared → Universal support
- **50%+ Budget** → Humanity permanently prioritizes healing over killing

The spiral accelerates with each cycle as success breeds more success, eventually flipping humanity's spending from destruction to flourishing.

## VII. The Investment

**Targeting 270% Annual Returns for Saving Humanity**

### VICTORY Bonds

**Better Returns Than Cocaine Trafficking (And Legal)**

**This is a high-risk, venture-style investment targeting 270% annual returns. Perpetually.**

Think of it as the ultimate asymmetric bet. If we fail, you lose your investment. But if we fail, you'll also die.  In which case, you won't have the ability to care about the money you lost.

Better than:

- Warren Buffett (20%)
- Index funds (10%) 
- Cocaine Trafficking (90% but risky)
- Your cousin's crypto scheme (-100%)

{{< include brain/figures/victory-bonds-roi-projection-bar-chart.qmd >}}

### The Revenue Model

**How You Get 270% Returns Forever**

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    subgraph "The VICTORY Bonds Money Machine"

    end

    Investors --> Campaign
    Campaign --> Treaty
    Treaty --> Returns
    Treaty --> Cures
    Returns -.->|"Attracts More"| Investors
```

**The math:** Raise $1B → Redirect $27B annually → Investors get 10% of treaty inflows → $2.7B/year forever.

**Important distinction:**
- VICTORY bonds: 270% annual returns for investors (you getting rich)
- dFDA Infrastructure: 463:1 societal ROI (humanity getting rich)
- We capture 26% of value created, humanity gets the other 74%

Your grandchildren's grandchildren are still getting paid. Disease and death get fired.

### Who Wins

**Everyone Profits More From Cures Than Forever Wars**

**Defense Contractors**: "Wait, we can make 270% returns instead of 8% margins? And keep 99% of our military budget? Where do we sign?"

**Insurance Companies**: Every cure = billions they don't pay out. They're literally betting on you not dying. Finally, aligned incentives!

**Big Pharma**: Here's the beautiful part. Instead of burning $48,000 per patient in trials, patients now PAY THEM (covered by DIH subsidies). From biggest expense to revenue stream.

**Politicians**: We create Super PACs. Vote for the treaty or we fund your opponent with bar graphs showing you hate grandmas with cancer.

**Billionaires**: Better than the Giving Pledge. 270% returns. Your current wealth becomes a rounding error.

**Poor People**: Don't die of preventable diseases (revolutionary concept)

**You**: Get to see your grandchildren graduate (and their grandchildren, and theirs...)

**Death**: Gets fired

Humanity spends **$118.8 trillion a year** on war and disease. That's **$14,850 per human per year** on suffering.

We're asking for **1% of the military budget**. The military keeps 99% - enough to end the world 66 times instead of 67.

This isn't liberal or conservative. It's math.

The people in charge aren't evil. They just like money. So we're making saving lives more profitable than ending them.

The choice is binary: Continue our death march toward mutual annihilation, or redirect 1% toward universal flourishing.
