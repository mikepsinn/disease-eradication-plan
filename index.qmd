## I. The Problem: We Spend $119 Trillion Annually on Death While Spending 0.06% on Cures

### The $119 Trillion Death Toilet: How Humanity's Budget Prioritizes The War on Humanity Over The War on Disease

Think of Earth as a household. A deeply disturbed household. Here's what we spend our allowance on:

#### Spending on The War on Humanity vs The War on Disease

We spend **[$2.72 trillion](./brain/book/references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)** every year on tools designed specifically to make humans stop being alive. Nuclear bombs. Bullets. AI murder-bots. Invisible jets that cost more than hospitals. Satellites that can see your bald spot from space. Probably some kind of earthquake machine.

Meanwhile, we spend $68 billion on medical research. That's **40 times less** on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses.

```{mermaid}
pie title "Global Annual Spending: Death vs Life"
    "Military (Death Tools)" : 2720
    "Medical Research (Life Tools)" : 68
```

{{< include brain/figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-comparison.qmd >}}


For every dollar looking for cancer treatments, we spend $40 on bombs and stuff.

But wait. It gets dumber.

#### The Hidden Costs of Idiotic Wars

{{< include brain/figures/war-hidden-direct-curing-diseases-column-chart.qmd >}}

The Pentagon alone has **lost** $2.5 trillion. Not spent. Lost. Like change in a couch, except the couch is the size of Nebraska and the change could cure cancer hundreds of times over. The Pentagon loses more money than exists in most countries.

 We have a Space Force but no Death Force. Your chance of dying from terrorism: 1 in 30 million. Your chance of dying from disease: 100%.

When you actually use these murder tools, the real costs explode:

- Cities become parking lots (expensive to rebuild)
- Children miss school (become stupid adults)
- Hospitals explode (sick people die faster)
- Farms get poisoned (everyone gets hungry)
- Millions get PTSD (can't work, need therapy forever)
- The lucky ones just die
- The unlucky ones live with half a face

**Total true cost of war: $9.7 trillion annually.** That's enough money to give every human on Earth $1,200 just to shut up about their problems.


#### Now Add What Not Curing Diseases Actually Costs Us

{{< include brain/figures/disease-vs-curing-costs-column-chart.qmd >}}

Disease doesn't just kill you. It bankrupts you first. Disease is profitable too. Not curing it, treating it. Insulin costs $300 a vial because dead diabetics don't buy insulin, but cured diabetics don't either. So we keep them barely alive. It's good business.

The global burden of disease (watching people rot + lost productivity + everyone's GoFundMe) is **$109 trillion annually**.

Add it all up: **$119 trillion per year** on death and suffering. That's more than Earth's entire GDP, somehow.

While spending **$68 billion** trying to prevent it. A rounding error.

#### You Are a Meat Robot (and It's Possible to Fix Robots)

You might say that $109 trillion worth of death and disease is unavoidable. Fortunately, you'd be completely wrong!

**Death is not a law of nature. It's a mechanical failure we haven't figured out how to fix yet.**

Your body is basically a self-repairing meat robot running on chemistry:
- Software: DNA (literally just code, like Windows but with more bugs)
- Hardware: Organs (your CPU and cooling system made of ham)
- Self-repair protocols: You build 330 billion new cells daily
- No warranty: God's customer service is terrible

Death is what happens when your repair subroutines can't keep up with hardware degradation. That's it. 

**Proof We Can Already Fix You:**
- We hot-swap hearts like power supplies
- A kid in Michigan has a 3D-printed titanium skull
- We can reprogram skin cells to become brain cells (like reformatting a hard drive as RAM)
- CRISPR literally debugs human source code with find-and-replace

**Animals That Solved Death While We Built Bombs:**
- Hydras: Biologically immortal, been alive since before your country existed
- Naked mole rats: Live 10x longer than they should, immune to cancer, look terrible
- Bowhead whales: 200+ years old, no wrinkles

Harvard scientists already reversed aging in mice - made them young again. Humans are just big mice with mortgages. If it works in mice, it'll work in you. Eventually. Unless we keep spending all our money on bombs.

#### The Final Stupidity Ratio: 1,750-to-1

**We spend 1,750 times more money causing or mopping up death than preventing it.**

| What We Buy | Annual Cost | Translation for Idiots |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Death Toilet** | | |
| Disease (watching people rot) | $109.1 Trillion | Everyone you love slowly dissolving while you pay to watch |
| War (professional murder) | $9.7 Trillion | Turning children into skeletons for fun and profit |
| **Total Death Toilet** | **$118.8 Trillion** | **More than Earth's entire GDP, somehow** |
| | | |
| **Things That Don't Kill Us** | | |
| Houses | $23.0 Trillion | Boxes to die in (at least they have WiFi) |
| Cars & Planes | $12.0 Trillion | Metal tubes to die in (but faster) |
| Food | $9.0 Trillion | Fuel for your meat robot |
| Teaching Kids | $6.0 Trillion | How to read death certificates |
| Roads & Internet | $4.0 Trillion | Infrastructure for dying while browsing |
| **Actually Curing Diseases** | **$0.068 Trillion** | **A rounding error. LOL.** |

If humanity's budget was a family making $100,000/year:

- Healthcare (treating symptoms): $8,200
- Military (home defense): $2,700  
- Medical research (finding cures): **$68**

That's like buying 1,600 mops instead of fixing the burst pipe.


### 150,000 Die Daily From Preventable Diseases While We Count Missiles

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/disease-deaths-vs-historical-events-chart.qmd >}} -->

![Comparison of annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)

While you read this sentence, 17 people died from preventable diseases. By the time you finish this chapter, over 150,000 will be gone. That's a small city. Deleted. Ctrl+Alt+Delete on a Cincinnati worth of humans.

Every day we delay costs:

- **$137 million** burned in inefficiency (enough to buy 274,000 PS5s)
- **2,301 Quality-Adjusted Life Years** lost (that's 2,301 years of someone's grandma)
- **150,671 people** dead from preventable disease
- While you read this paragraph: **$66,000 vanished**, someone lost a year of life

The speed of stupidity:

- Every second: $196,900 spent on war instead of cures
- Every heartbeat: Someone dies of something curable
- Every time you blink: $590,700 flushed down the death toilet

And while we're perfecting the art of long-distance murder, your body is quietly falling apart. Your cancer cells are multiplying RIGHT NOW. Your brain is deleting memories. Your joints are turning into gravel. Your heart is getting tired of beating. Your telomeres are shortening. You are literally dissolving.

You'd think we'd spend money fixing this.

You'd be adorable for thinking that.

We spend **40 times less** on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses. We haven't cured a single disease in [50 years](./brain/book/references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated). But we have enough nukes to end civilization several times over, just in case the first apocalypse doesn't take.

### Why Greed and Evolution Keep This System Running

Here's the brutal truth: Every one of us, from the most powerful president to the lowliest pauper, is doomed to a life of gradually escalating suffering until it ends in catastrophe.  

We are all prisoners to this moronic system. This system made sense in a world of scarcity when we were hitting each other with rocks over the last berry bush. Kill or be killed. Hoard or starve. Trust no one outside your tribe.

But now? We live in a world of abundance and nuclear weapons. We can feed everyone twice over, but we'd rather burn grain to keep prices high. We can cure diseases, but we'd rather sell treatments forever. The software running human civilization is 10,000 years out of date, and the bugs are literally killing us.

Why don't we update the software? Why do we cling to a system designed for cave-dwelling murderers when we could be immortal space wizards?

Here's the ugly answer: It's profitable.

Every bomb makes someone rich. Every missile funds a yacht. Every war creates a billionaire.

Disease is profitable too. Not curing it, treating it. Insulin costs $300 a vial because dead diabetics don't buy insulin, but cured diabetics don't either. So we keep them barely alive. It's good business.

The people making money from war and disease aren't evil. They just like money. We can't change human nature, but we can create economic systems that make curing people more profitable than killing them.

### Democracy Is Broken: Princeton Proved Your Vote Doesn't Matter

Lots of people think we can fix this simply by electing better leaders. But what lots of people don't realize is that democracy is basically just theatre at this point.

Princeton University did a study. They analyzed 1,779 policy decisions over 20 years. The correlation between what you want and what happens? 

**Zero. Percent.**

Not low. Not small. ZERO.

But when economic elites want something? They get it 78% of the time.

You have the same political influence as your houseplant. Actually less, at least politicians pretend to care about the environment.

Your "representative" has 750,000 constituents. You get 0.00013% of their attention. They spend 70% of their time fundraising from rich people who aren't you.

This isn't cynicism. It's math. You live in an oligarchy with democracy cosplay.

The math that matters:

- 0% correlation between public preference and policy outcomes
- 78% correlation when economic elites want something
- Translation: You're not a citizen. You're a spectator with a ballot.

Professors Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page analyzed over two decades of data to answer a fundamental question: **Does the government represent the people?**

After examining nearly 2,000 public opinion surveys and comparing them to actual policy outcomes, they discovered that the opinions of [90% of Americans have virtually no impact on legislation](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf).

In a representative democracy, the more people like a bill, the more likely it would be to become law.

![](assets/bill-public-support-vs-chance-of-adoption-true-democracy.png)

However, in reality, public support has almost no influence on what laws are passed. Whether there is [0% or 100%](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf) support for a policy, there's a [30% likelihood](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf) that it will become law.

    dFDA --> Results["✨ Results<br/>• 82X cost reduction<br/>• 17 years → 2 years<br/>• 100% patient access<br/>• Millions of lives saved"]
```

### System 1: The 1% Treaty - Redirect $27B From Military to Medical

Every nation redirects just **1%** of their current murder budget to a Decentralized Institute of Health (DIH) that will pay for sick people to participate in super-efficient decentralized clinical trials.

We'd still have $2.69 trillion left for everyone.  $2.69 trillion is enough to murder everyone on Earth 67 times. (Current population: 8 billion. Murder capacity: 535 billion. We're overachievers.)

### System 2: The Decentralized FDA - Amazon for Clinical Trials

The current FDA is Soviet central planning: One committee in Maryland decides what 335 million Americans can try. Takes 17 years, costs $2.2 billion, everyone dies waiting. 

**Historical Proof This Failed**: In 1962, FDA outlawed decentralized pragmatic efficacy trials run by doctors and published in JAMA. Immediate disaster:

- New drug approvals dropped 70% overnight (whoops)
- Drug costs: $74M → $2.6B today (35X more expensive)
- Timeline: 2-3 years → 17 years to market
- Life expectancy gains slowed by more than half
- Before 1962: 144,000 doctors ran real-world trials
- After 1962: 200 bureaucrats pretending to be god

![Figure 9: dFDA Interface Mockup - Shows Amazon-style layout with treatments as "products," star ratings from real patients, filters for conditions/side effects/cost, "Add to My Treatment Plan" buttons, and integration with Apple Health showing real-time outcome tracking.]

The dFDA is Amazon meets Yelp for not dying:

- **Treatment Rankings**: Enter your condition and see all treatments ranked by real-world effectiveness
- **One-Click Join**: Click "Try This Treatment" from your doctor's iPad during your appointment
- **Open Source**: Anyone can build on it

**The Payment Revolution**:

- Old FDA trials: Pharma burns $48,000 per patient
- dFDA trials: Patients PAY pharma (covered by DIH subsidies)
- Pharma goes from biggest expense to revenue generator DURING trials
- CEOs are literally crying tears of joy (and money)

**How patients get paid to participate (Dynamic Voucher System)**:

- Researchers set prices based on trial difficulty ($100 for easy, $5,000 for invasive)
- DIH subsidies = total treaty funds ÷ participating patients
- More people join = bigger treaty = bigger subsidies for everyone
- Creates viral incentive: "Join my trial, we both get paid more!"
- Refundable deposits ensure commitment (no-shows hurt everyone's payout)

Cost per patient: $500 (competition) vs $41,000 (monopoly)
Time to results: 2 years (markets) vs 17 years (bureaucracy)
Patient access: 100% (integrated) vs 15% (gatekept)

    FDA5 -.->|"82X Efficiency Gain"| dFDA5
```

It's literally Amazon but for cures. Same convenience, same competition, same customer obsession - but instead of buying crap you don't need, you're buying years of life.

### System 3: The DIH Treasury - Markets Replace NIH Committees

The NIH: Where good ideas go to fill out forms until they die of old age. It's literally Soviet science:

- A central committee of 200 reviewers pretends to know all human knowledge
- $48 billion is allocated by politics, not results
- A 90% rejection rate means most good ideas die in committee
- Scientists spend 60% of their time begging for money like Victorian orphans instead of doing science

The DIH replaces this broken system with a simple, market-based approach. Instead of a committee picking winners, the DIH treasury directly subsidizes patients in the dFDA marketplace, letting them choose which trials to fund.

This unleashes the power of decentralized decision-making:

- **Wisdom of Crowds**: Millions of patients and their doctors deciding is smarter than 200 bureaucrats guessing.
- **Real Competition**: The best treatments attract patients and funding.
- **No Gatekeepers**: If patients are willing, a trial can get funded. Data and patient demand (not politics) pick the winners.
- **Pay for Success**: Researchers are rewarded for running trials that attract patients and deliver results, not for writing grant proposals.

#### The Economic Proof: We Save $5.87 Million Per Life Saved

{{< include brain/figures/charity-cost-vs-roi-comparison-bar.qmd >}}

While the world's best charities spend $3,500-5,500 to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society $5.87 million per life saved**. This isn't charity—it's the most profitable intervention in human history.

{{< include brain/figures/dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

The dFDA alone achieves a 463:1 return on investment—comparable to history's greatest public health achievements like smallpox eradication (280:1) and childhood vaccinations (13:1). This exceptional ROI comes from multiple sources: $50B in annual R&D cost savings, faster access to new treatments, better prevention through real-world data analysis, and enabling new therapies for rare and neglected diseases.

{{< include brain/figures/treaty-dih-dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

But here's the real magic: when funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**. Here's why the ROI is literally infinite:

- **Zero net cost to society**: The $27B comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **$147B in annual benefits**: Peace dividend ($97.1B) + R&D savings ($50B)
- **The math**: $147B benefit ÷ $0 new cost = ∞ (infinite ROI)
- **Result**: Society gets paid $147 billion per year to save lives

This makes it a "dominant intervention" in economic terms: it saves money and improves health simultaneously. It's the only intervention in history where the return on investment is literally infinite—because we're not spending new money, we're just redirecting money from war to cures.

**The math** ([see full calculation](brain/book/economics/icer-full-calculation.qmd)):
- Benefits: $147.1B/year (peace dividend + R&D savings)
- Costs: $290M/year (campaign + operations)
- Lives saved: 25,000/year (875,000 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **Result: Society profits $167,771 per year of life saved**

This is a **dominant health intervention**—it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives. It's what happens when you redirect money from destroying life to creating it.

#### The Scale: 10× Bigger Than History's Best Public Health Wins

{{< include brain/figures/public-health-impact-comparison-horizontal-bar.qmd >}}

The $147.1 billion annual economic benefit makes this intervention nearly **10× larger than childhood vaccinations**—one of the most successful public health programs in history. The stacked bar shows how both the peace dividend ($97.1B) and dFDA R&D savings ($50B) contribute to this unprecedented scale.

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors 270% annual returns.

### System 4: Wishocracy - 8 Billion Brains Beat 200 Bureaucrats

Current democracy: 535 people in Washington pretend to represent 335 million Americans while actually representing whoever paid for their campaign.

Wishocracy: 8 billion people make tiny decisions that add up to smart big decisions.

![Figure 11: Wishocracy Interface - Mobile app showing simple A/B choice: "Cancer Research" vs "Climate Technology" with swipe left/right mechanics like Tinder. Progress bar shows "17/20 decisions made." Background shows real-time global vote aggregation forming humanity's true priorities.]

How it works:

1. Instead of "rank these 10,000 problems," you see two: "Cancer or climate change?"
2. You pick. Takes 2 seconds.
3. Do this 20 times. Takes 5 minutes total.
4. Math happens (the good kind).
5. We get a perfect budget that reflects what humanity actually wants.

## III. The Proof: Oxford Already Achieved 82X Cost Reduction

### The Oxford RECOVERY Trial: $500 vs FDA's $41,000 Per Patient

The UK spent $500 per patient testing COVID treatments. Saved a million lives.

America spent $41,000 per patient on paperwork. Saved a million documents.

We're not inventing anything. We're just doing the smart thing more often.

### The Math: How Competition Creates 82X Efficiency Gains

- Current cost to develop a drug: $2.2 billion
- New cost with competition: ~$27 million
- Efficiency gain: ~82X (Oxford showed 82X reduction possible)
- Lives saved: Millions annually
- Jobs lost: Zero (we redirect the same companies)
- Legal lobbying budget: $1-2.5 billion

### Who Wins: Every Stakeholder Profits More From Cures Than Disease

**Defense Contractors**: "Wait, we can make 40% returns instead of 8% margins? And keep 99% of our military budget? Where do we sign?"

**Insurance Companies**: Every cure = billions they don't pay out. They're literally betting on you not dying. Finally, aligned incentives!

**Big Pharma**: Here's the beautiful part. Instead of burning $48,000 per patient in trials, patients now PAY THEM (covered by DIH subsidies). From biggest expense to revenue stream.

**Politicians**: We create Super PACs. Vote for the treaty or we fund your opponent with bar graphs showing you hate grandmas with cancer.

**Billionaires**: Better than the Giving Pledge. 40% returns AND you get to be the founder of a $100 trillion company that ended human suffering. Your current wealth becomes a rounding error.

**Defense Contractors**: Get 270% returns from VICTORY bonds while keeping 99% of current contracts

**Poor People**: Don't die of preventable diseases (revolutionary concept)

**You**: Get to see your grandchildren graduate (and their grandchildren, and theirs...)

**Death**: Gets fired

It's capitalism, but pointed at not dying.

## IV. The Future: Choose Between Mad Max or Star Trek

### Path A (Idiocracy): Nuclear Winter and 35-Year Lifespans by 2050

![Figure 8: Choose Your Own Adventure - Split timeline visualization. Left path leads to dark "Idiocracy" with mushroom clouds, bunkers, and people fighting over water. Right path leads to bright "Wishonia" with floating cities, healthy centenarians playing tennis, and children learning from holographic teachers.]

**Idiocracy (if we keep funding war) - The Three Subs:**

- 🧠 **Sub-Intelligence**: IQ dropping, education collapsed, eating lead paint for nutrients
- ⏳ **Sub-Longevity**: Life expectancy 35, dying of scurvy like a pirate
- 😢 **Sub-Wellbeing**: 80% mentally ill, constant fear, happiness is illegal
- Nuclear winter by 2050
- Diet: Bugs and bunker rations (the bugs are winning)
- Entertainment: Fighting over water (water usually wins)
- WiFi: Terrible
- Status: Mad Max but with worse teeth

### Path B (Wishonia): Optional Death and Paradise by 2050

**Wishonia (if we fund cures) - The Three Supers:**

- 🧠 **Super-Intelligence**: IQ unlimited, merge with AI, understand Rick & Morty
- ⏳ **Super-Longevity**: Death optional, backups available, respawn enabled
- 😊 **Super-Wellbeing**: Happiness baseline adjustable, suffering extinct, bliss on tap
- Death defeated by 2050 (it retired)
- Life expectancy: "Yes"
- Disease: In museums next to smallpox
- Poverty: Conceptually impossible
- War: "That thing where people murdered each other? Weird."
- WiFi: Telepathic
- Status: Star Trek but with better writing

Your kid gets diagnosed with something unpronounceable. 

In Idiocracy: You sell your house, start a GoFundMe, watch her die anyway.

In Wishonia: The doctor uploads her DNA, a computer designs a cure, the pharmacy prints it, she's fine by Thursday. Cost: $0. Because we stopped buying bombs.

Cancer becomes like strep throat, annoying but fixable. Alzheimer's gets deleted. Hearts get upgraded. Death becomes optional, or at least negotiable.

Your great-grandchildren will think we were barbarians. "They let people die of CANCER?" they'll say. "What, did they also drill holes in skulls for headaches?"

Yes, actually. We did that too.

When we stop spending money on murder:

- Healthcare costs approach zero (no sick people = no bills)
- The $16.5 trillion we waste on violence goes to space colonies or whatever
- Humans live as long as they want (or until they get bored)
- The entire concept of "retirement" becomes weird
- Insurance companies have to find real jobs

This isn't utopia. People will still be people. We'll still have reality TV and Twitter. But at least we won't be dying of preventable diseases while building our 10,000th nuclear warhead.

## V. The Strategy: How to Pass a Global Treaty in 5 Steps

    Step1 --> Step2
    Step2 --> Step3
    Step3 --> Step4
    Step4 --> Step5
    Step5 -.->|"Success Spiral"| Step1
```

### Step 1: Get 280 Million Votes in Global Referendum

Give everyone on Earth a lottery ticket to the future. Call them VOTE points. They're worthless now, but if we win, they become claims on the $16.5 trillion annual peace dividend.

It's like Bitcoin, but instead of wasting electricity, we're saving lives.

Get [3.5% of humanity](./brain/book/references.qmd#3-5-rule) to click "yes" on "Do you want to not die?"

(Harder than it sounds. Humans are suspicious of good ideas.)

### Step 2: Raise $1B Through VICTORY Bonds

Remember World War II? America sold war bonds to fund the fight against fascism. People bought them because:

1. They hated Nazis
2. They loved money
3. Kate Smith sang at them until they cried

We're doing the same thing, but for the War on Disease. Except instead of Kate Smith, we have spreadsheets.

### Step 3: Deploy $1B on Legal Lobbying

The military-industrial complex spends $1 on lobbying and gets [$1,813 back](./brain/book/references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc) in contracts. It's the best investment in the world, if you don't mind the screaming.

So we're going to do the exact same thing, but backwards. We'll use their own playbook to build a coalition where everyone profits more from cures than disease (see "Who Wins" above for the beautiful details).

### Step 4: Create Super PACs That Punish Treaty Opponents

Create Super PACs in every country. Not to support candidates, to support math. If your district votes 70% for the treaty and you vote against it, we fund your opponent with spreadsheets and bar graphs.


### Step 5: Watch Treaties Pass and Diseases Fall

![Figure 14: The Success Spiral - Animated spiral showing: 1% Treaty → First cures → Media coverage → More votes → 2% Treaty → More cures → 5% Treaty → Eventually spiraling up to majority of budget going to healing instead of killing. Each loop shows increasing speed and scale.]

## VI. The Investment: 270% Annual Returns for Saving Humanity

### VICTORY Bonds: Better Returns Than Cocaine Trafficking (And Legal)

**We're offering 270% annual returns. Perpetually.**

Better than:

- Warren Buffett (20%)
- Index funds (10%) 
- Your cousin's crypto scheme (-100%)

![Figure 13: VICTORY Bonds Returns Comparison - Bar chart showing investment returns: Cocaine trafficking (35% but with jail bars), VICTORY bonds (40% with peace symbols), Stock market (10%), Real estate (8%), Savings account (0.5%). VICTORY bonds bar is gold and sparkles.]

**IMPORTANT MATH FOR CONFUSED PEOPLE:**

- VICTORY bonds: 270% annual returns for investors (that's you getting rich)
- dFDA Infrastructure: 463:1 societal ROI (that's humanity getting rich)
- Translation: You make 270% per year forever, society makes $463 for every $1 spent
- Everyone wins except disease and death

### The Revenue Model: Capturing 1% of $119T Death Economy

**Here's how:**

- We raise $1 billion to redirect $27 billion annually
- You get 10% of treaty inflows = $2.7B/year
- That's 270% returns. Forever.
- If we fully succeed, your grandchildren's grandchildren are still getting paid

**The Two-Layer Money Machine:**

- Direct Capture: $24.4B to DIH treasury (1% military budget cut)
- Societal Dividend: $92B in total economic benefit (reduced disease burden)
- We only capture 26% of the value we create
- The other 74% flows to humanity: cheaper healthcare, longer lives, more productivity
- Translation: We're giving $3 to humanity for every $1 we take


**The Bootstrap Hustle:**

1. Sell VICTORY bonds to rich people who fear death (all of them)
2. Use that $1B for AI-powered campaign (viral + lobbying + tech)
3. Get the treaty signed
4. Treaty money pays bondholders $2.7B/year forever
5. Everyone gets rich except disease and death

        Cures["💊 Cures<br/>$24.3B to dFDA<br/>trials & research"]
    end

    Investors --> Campaign
    Campaign --> Treaty
    Treaty --> Returns
    Treaty --> Cures
    Returns -.->|"Attracts More"| Investors
```

It's a virtuous cycle where early investors fund the lobbying that creates the treaty that generates the returns that attract more investors.

### Building the First $100 Trillion Company

If we capture just 1% of the $118 trillion war and disease burden through efficiency gains, that's $1.18 trillion in value created annually. At standard tech valuations (10X revenue), the ecosystem we create could be worth over $10 trillion. 
That's 33 Apples. The most valuable company in history. By preventing suffering instead of causing it.

## VII. Your Choice: Join the Revolution or Die of Something Preventable

Listen: Humanity spends $118.8 trillion a year on war and disease.

That's $14,850 per human per year on suffering.

We're asking for 1% of the military budget. One percent. To cure the diseases that are going to kill you, your parents, your children, and everyone you've ever loved.

The military will still have 99% of its budget. That's enough to end the world 66 times instead of 67.

This isn't liberal or conservative. It's not capitalism or socialism. It's math.

We can keep building bombs until the sun explodes, or we can cure cancer.

We can keep treating symptoms until everyone's bankrupt, or we can eliminate disease.

We can keep being the stupidest species in the universe, or we can try something else.

The people in charge aren't evil. They just like money. So we're going to change what makes the most money. We're going to make saving lives more profitable than ending them.

This isn't just another policy proposal. This is the only realistic path to transcending our natural state of barbarism and fully realizing the magnificent potential of the gifts we've been given: consciousness, reason, and love. We can remain slaves to a system designed for scarce resources and stone axes, or we can rewrite the code of civilization itself.

The choice is binary: Continue our death march toward mutual annihilation, or redirect a mere 1% toward universal flourishing.

*P.S. - If you think this is impossible, remember: We put humans on the moon using computers weaker than your phone. We split the atom. We invented cheese in a can. Surely we can figure out how to stop killing each other.*
