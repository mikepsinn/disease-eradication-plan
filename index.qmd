## The Problem

### The Daily Holocaust

The number of people that die from curable diseases every year is equal to 18,274 September 11 terrorist attacks.

<!-- {{< include brain/figures/disease-deaths-vs-historical-events-chart.qmd >}} -->

![Comparison of annual deaths from disease (54,750,000) versus deaths from 9/11 Terrorist Attacks (2,996)](assets/deaths-from-disease-vs-deaths-from-terrorism-chart.png)


Your body is quietly falling apart. Your cancer cells are multiplying RIGHT NOW. Your brain is deleting memories. Your joints are slowly turning into gravel. Your heart is getting tired of beating. Your telomeres are shortening. You are literally dissolving.

You'd think we'd prioritize fixing this. You'd be adorable for thinking that.

We haven't cured a single disease in [50 years](./brain/book/references.qmd#smallpox-eradicated). But we have enough nukes to end civilization 13 times, just in case the first apocalypse doesn't take.

### The Cost of War

We spend **[$2.72 trillion](./brain/book/references.qmd#sipri-2024-spending)** every year on stuff designed specifically to make humans stop being alive. 

These include sundry items such as:

- Nuclear bombs. 
- Bullets. 
- AI murder-bots. 
- Invisible jets that cost more than hospitals. 
- Satellites that can see your bald spot from space. 
- Probably some kind of earthquake machine.

Meanwhile, we spend $68 billion on medical research. That's **40 times less** on curing all diseases combined than we spend on new ways to create corpses.

{{< include brain/figures/military-vs-medical-research-spending-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The Pentagon alone has **lost** $2.5 trillion. Not spent. Lost. Like change in a couch, except the couch is the size of Nebraska and the change could cure cancer hundreds of times over. The Pentagon loses more money than exists in most countries.

We have a Space Force but no Death Force. Your chance of dying from terrorism: 1 in 30 million. Your chance of dying from disease: 100%.

But wait. It gets dumber.

#### Hidden Costs of War

When you consider the secondary effects of war, the total costs explode:

- Cities become parking lots (expensive to rebuild)
- Children miss school (become stupid adults)
- Hospitals explode (sick people die faster)
- Farms get poisoned (everyone gets hungry)
- Millions get PTSD (can't work, need therapy forever)
- The lucky ones just die
- The unlucky ones live with half a face

{{< include brain/figures/war-hidden-direct-curing-diseases-column-chart.qmd >}}

**Total true cost of war: $9.7 trillion every single year.** 

#### The Costs of Disease

So before we begin, you must understand that you are a meat robot.

Aging and disease are just mechanical failures that can be fixed (but we haven't figured out how to fix them because we're too busy blowing each other up).

Your body is a machine. When machines break, we fix them. We don't just "manage symptoms" of a broken car engine. We replace the parts.

Yet somehow, we've convinced ourselves that human bodies are magical exceptions to basic engineering principles. They're not.

**Every disease is just a mechanical problem:**
- Cancer? Cells with broken replication code
- Alzheimer's? Protein buildup clogging neural circuits  
- Heart disease? Plumbing failure
- Diabetes? Fuel regulation system malfunction
- Aging itself? Accumulated wear and tear

We're not limited by biology. We're limited by paying our smartest humans to make bombs instead of figuring these things out.

The cost of almost never curing any diseases is **$109 trillion annually**. 

Add war's $9.7 trillion. 

Total: **$119 trillion per year** humanity flushes down the death toilet.

{{< include brain/figures/death-economy-flow-diagram.qmd >}}

#### The Final Stupidity Ratio: 1,750-to-1

**We spend 1,750 times more money causing or mopping up death than preventing it.**

| What We Buy | Annual Cost | Translation for Idiots |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Death Toilet** | | |
| Disease (watching people rot) | $109.1 Trillion | Everyone you love slowly dissolving while you pay to watch |
| War (professional murder) | $9.7 Trillion | Turning children into skeletons for fun and profit |
| **Total Death Toilet** | **$118.8 Trillion** | **More than Earth's entire GDP, somehow** |
| | | |
| **Things That Don't Kill Us** | | |
| Houses | $23.0 Trillion | Boxes to die in (at least they have WiFi) |
| Cars & Planes | $12.0 Trillion | Metal tubes to die in (but faster) |
| Food | $9.0 Trillion | Fuel for your meat robot |
| Teaching Kids | $6.0 Trillion | How to read death certificates |
| Roads & Internet | $4.0 Trillion | Infrastructure for dying while browsing |
| **Actually Curing Diseases** | **$0.068 Trillion** | **A rounding error. LOL.** |

If humanity's budget was a family making $100,000/year:
- Healthcare (treating symptoms): $8,200
- Military (home defense): $2,700
- Medical research (finding cures): **$68**

That's like buying 1,600 mops instead of fixing the burst pipe.

{{< include brain/figures/disease-vs-curing-costs-column-chart.qmd >}}

### Why We're Idiots

Every one of us, from the most powerful president to the lowliest pauper, is doomed to a life of gradually escalating suffering until it ends in catastrophe.  

We are all prisoners to this moronic system. This system made sense in a world of scarcity when we were hitting each other with rocks over the last berry bush. Kill or be killed. Hoard or starve. Trust no one outside your tribe.

But now? We live in a world of abundance and nuclear weapons. We can feed everyone twice over, but we'd rather burn grain to keep prices high. We can cure diseases, but we'd rather sell treatments forever. The software running human civilization is 10,000 years out of date, and the bugs are literally killing us.

Why don't we update the software? Why do we cling to a system designed for cave-dwelling murderers when we could be immortal space wizards?

Because the current system makes idiocy more profitable.

Every bomb makes someone rich. Every missile funds a yacht. Every war creates a billionaire.

Disease is profitable too. Not curing it, treating it. Insulin costs $300 a vial because dead diabetics don't buy insulin, but cured diabetics don't either. So we keep them barely alive. It's good business.

The people making money from war and disease aren't evil. They just like money. We can't change human nature, but we can create economic systems that make curing people more profitable than killing them.

### Democracy Can't Fix This

Lots of people think we can fix this simply by electing better leaders. But what lots of people don't realize is that democracy is basically just theatre at this point.

Princeton University did a study. They analyzed 1,779 policy decisions over 20 years. The correlation between what you want and what happens?

**Zero. Percent.**

Not low. Not small. ZERO.

But when economic elites want something? They get it 78% of the time.

You have the same political influence as your houseplant. Actually less, at least politicians pretend to care about the environment.

Your "representative" has 750,000 constituents. You get 0.00013% of their attention. They spend 70% of their time fundraising from rich people who aren't you.

The math that matters:

- 0% correlation between public preference and policy outcomes
- 78% correlation when economic elites want something
- Translation: You're not a citizen. You're a spectator with a ballot.

Professors Martin Gilens and Benjamin Page analyzed over two decades of data to answer a fundamental question: **Does the government represent the people?**

After examining nearly 2,000 public opinion surveys and comparing them to actual policy outcomes, they discovered that the opinions of [90% of Americans have virtually no impact on legislation](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf).

In a representative democracy, the more people like a bill, the more likely it would be to become law.

![](assets/bill-public-support-vs-chance-of-adoption-true-democracy.png)

However, in reality, public support has almost no influence on what laws are passed. Whether there is [0% or 100%](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf) support for a policy, there's a [30% likelihood](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B/S1537592714001595a.pdf/testing_theories_of_american_politics_elites_interest_groups_and_average_citizens.pdf) that it will become law.

![](assets/bill-public-support-vs-chance-of-adoption-what-actually-happens.png)

So voting won't fix this. Neither will protests. The system is designed to ignore you.

This isn't cynicism. It's math. You live in an oligarchy with democracy cosplay.

But there's another way to change the world: **Make doing the right thing more profitable than doing the wrong thing.**

## The Solution

**3 Ingredients of a World Without War and Disease**

{{< include brain/figures/three-ingredients-system-diagram.qmd >}}

### The 1% Treaty

**Redirect $27B/year from the War on Humanity to the War on Disease**

Every nation redirects just **1%** of their current murder budget to a Decentralized Institute of Health (DIH) that will pay for sick people to participate in super-efficient decentralized clinical trials.

We'd still have $2.69 trillion left for everyone.  $2.69 trillion is enough to murder everyone on Earth 67 times. (Literally.)

### The DIH Treasury

The NIH: 

Since 1970, the NIH has spent **$1.1 trillion** (inflation-adjusted). 

Diseases eradicated: **zero**. 

Meanwhile, Americans got **3X more obese** and **3.4X more diabetic**. 

It's literally Soviet science:

- A central committee of 200 reviewers pretends to know all human knowledge
- $48 billion is allocated by politics, not results
- **85% of patients are systematically excluded** from trials
- The average scientist doesn't get their first real grant until **age 45**—two decades past peak creativity
- Scientists spend 60% of their time begging for money like Victorian orphans instead of doing science
- The NIH got $1.6B for COVID research and completed zero 0 trials in 4 years

The solution: a simple, market-based approach. Instead of a committee picking winners, the DIH treasury directly subsidizes patients in the dFDA marketplace, letting them choose which trials to fund.

The DIH uses the power of global collective intelligence:

- **Wisdom of Crowds**: Millions of patients and their doctors deciding is smarter than 200 bureaucrats guessing.
- **Real Competition**: Treatment rankings and outcome labels drive the best treatments to the top.
- **No Gatekeepers**: If patients are willing, a trial can get funded. Effectiveness and safety (not politics) pick the winners.
- **Pay for Success**: Researchers are directly rewarded for curing diseases, not for writing grant proposals.

#### How Patients Get Paid

**The Dynamic Voucher System**

- Researchers or the trial sponse sets a price for the trial
- DIH subsidies = total treaty funds ÷ participating patients
- More countries join = bigger treaty = bigger subsidies for everyone

#### Wishocracy: Preventing Capture

**Protecting the $24.3B From Special Interest Hamburglers**

**The Problem**: After we pay back the 10% to investors (the oligarchy that made this all possible), we still have $24.3 billion per year. Without safeguards, lobbyists and special interests will swarm like vultures. Within 5 years, the DIH would become just another captured institution funneling money to whoever has the best K Street connections.

**The Solution**: Wishocracy - where everyone votes on DIH budget allocation, preventing capture.

![Wishocracy Public Budget Voting Example](assets/wishocracy-slider.png)

**How it protects the $24.3B from capture**:

1. **Anyone can propose projects**: Patient subsidies, trial infrastructure, expanding to a 2% treaty - all competing for funding
2. **Everyone votes through pairwise comparisons**: "Fund Alzheimer's trials" vs "Build trial infrastructure in Africa?" Simple choices, not 10,000-item ballots
3. **Mathematical aggregation prevents gaming**: Can't buy 51% of votes when there are 8 billion voters
4. **Real-time transparency**: Every allocation is public.

**Why this matters**: Investors who funded this deserve their 10% returns. But the remaining 90% must serve humanity, not special interests.

Without Wishocracy, the DIH becomes another captured institution and repeats the exact same failures all over again.

### The Decentralized FDA

**Amazon for Clinical Trials + Consumer Reports for Drugs**

The current FDA is Soviet central planning: One committee in Maryland decides what 335 million Americans can try. Takes 17 years, costs $2.2 billion, everyone dies waiting.

**Historical Proof This Failed**: In 1962, congress passed the Kefauver Harris Amendment which effectively outlawed decentralized pragmatic efficacy trials run by doctors and published in JAMA. Immediate disaster:

- New drug approvals dropped 70% overnight
- Drug costs: $74M → $2.6B today (35X more expensive)
- Timeline: 2-3 years → 17 years to market
- Life expectancy gains slowed by more than half
- Before 1962: 144,000 doctors ran real-world trials
- After 1962: 200 bureaucrats pretending to be omniscient

![New Treatments Per Year](assets/new-treatments-per-year-2.png)

![Cost to Develop a New Drug](assets/cost-to-develop-a-new-drug.png)

### The Decentralized FDA

![](assets/black-box-model-animation.gif)

The dFDA is Amazon meets Consumer Reports for not dying:

- **Treatment Rankings**: Enter your condition and see all treatments ranked by real-world effectiveness
- **One-Click Join**: Click "Try This Treatment" from your doctor's iPad during your appointment


**82X More Efficient Than Current System**

- **Cost per patient**: $500 vs the current $41,000
- **Time to results**: 2 years vs the current 17 years
- **Patient access**: Universal access vs 85% excluded currently


{{< include brain/figures/fda-vs-dfda-efficiency-comparison-diagram.qmd >}}

**Outcome Labels: Nutrition Facts for Drugs**

Food has nutrition labels. Cigarettes have warning labels. Drugs have... incomprehensible 40-page inserts written by lawyers having seizures.

The dFDA fixes that with **Outcome Labels** - simple, data-driven summaries showing exactly what happens when real people try a treatment:

![Outcome Labels Example](assets/dfda-outcome-labels.png)

Based on thousands of real patients, you see:
- **Cognitive Improvements**: Memory +35%, Executive Function +22%
- **Side Effects**: Headache +9%, Fatigue +7%
- **The Truth**: Not marketing claims, actual measured effects from real humans

Just like nutrition labels transformed food transparency, outcome labels will transform medical transparency. No more guessing. No more 40-page legal documents. Just clear data about what actually happens.

**Treatment Rankings: Consumer Reports for Drugs**

Current system: Your doctor guesses which treatment might work based on one pharma lunch presentation from 2003.

dFDA system: Type your condition, see every treatment ranked by real-world effectiveness:

![Treatment Rankings Example](assets/dfda-comparative-effectiveness-ranking-search.png)

Search "Alzheimer's" and instantly see:
- **Lecanemab**: 92% effectiveness (FDA approved)
- **Donanemab**: 88% effectiveness (Phase 3)
- **Aducanumab**: 76% effectiveness (FDA approved)
- **Experimental options**: See Phase 2 trials you can join today

Each treatment shows:
- Real-world effectiveness scores from actual patients
- Approval status (FDA approved, Phase 3, Phase 2, experimental)
- One-click access to available trials
- Side effect profiles and outcome labels

## Proof This Isn't Insane

"But wait," you might say, "this sounds too good to be true. Has anyone actually proven that decentralized trials work better than the FDA's monopoly?"

Excellent question. Let me show you the proof.

**Oxford Already Achieved 82X Cost Reduction**

### The Oxford RECOVERY Trial

**$500 vs FDA's $41,000 Per Patient**

The UK spent $500 per patient testing COVID treatments. Saved a million lives.

America spent $41,000 per patient on paperwork.

### The Math

- Current cost to develop a drug: $2.2 billion
- New cost with decentralized pragmatic trials: ~$27 million
- Efficiency gain: ~82X (Oxford showed 82X reduction possible)
- Lives saved: Millions annually
- Legal lobbying budget: $1 billion

---

## The Economics

### Return on Investment

**463:1 ROI (Better Than Smallpox Eradication)**

The Decentralized FDA alone achieves a **463:1 return on investment**.  
This means for every $1 invested, we society get $463 in benefits. 

This exceptional ROI comes from multiple sources:
- **$50B in annual R&D cost savings**: 82X reduction in clinical trial costs
- **Faster access to new treatments**: 2 years instead of 17 years to market
- **Better prevention through real-world data**: Continuous learning from millions of patients
- **Enabling new therapies**: Making rare disease trials economically viable

{{< include brain/figures/dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

This ROI is better than history's greatest public health achievements like smallpox eradication (280:1) and childhood vaccinations (13:1).

### ROI With 1% Treaty Funding

**Infinite ROI (Self-Funding System)**

{{< include brain/figures/treaty-dih-dfda-roi-comparison-column-chart.qmd >}}

But here's the real magic: when funded by the 1% Treaty's military redirection, the entire system becomes **self-funding with infinite ROI**.

**Why the ROI is literally infinite** ([see full calculation](brain/book/economics/icer-full-calculation.qmd)):
- **Zero net cost**: The $27B comes from redirected military spending (money already budgeted)
- **$147.1B in annual benefits**: Peace dividend ($97.1B) + R&D savings ($50B)
- **Operating costs**: Only $290M/year (campaign + operations)
- **Lives saved**: 25,000/year (875,000 QALYs ÷ 35 QALYs/life)
- **The math**: $147B benefit ÷ $0 new spending = ∞ (infinite ROI)
- **Per life saved**: Society PROFITS $167,771 instead of spending

This is a **dominant health intervention**. 
This means it simultaneously saves money AND saves lives. 
Unlike traditional interventions requiring ongoing charity, this generates $147 billion annually while saving 25,000 lives. 

### Total Annual Benefit

**10X Bigger Than History's Best to Public Health Victories**

{{< include brain/figures/public-health-impact-horizontal-bar-chart.qmd >}}

The $147.1 billion annual economic benefit makes this intervention nearly **10× larger than childhood vaccinations** (one of the most successful public health programs in history). 
The stacked bar shows how both the peace dividend ($97.1B) and dFDA R&D savings ($50B) contribute to this unprecedented scale.

Unlike traditional interventions that require ongoing charitable funding, the 1% Treaty is **self-funding**: it generates the wealth needed to sustain itself through VICTORY bonds that pay investors 270% annual returns.

**Bottom line**: While the world's best charities spend $3,500-5,500 to save a life (which is excellent), the 1% Treaty + DIH + dFDA actually **SAVES society $5.87 million per life saved**.

## The Future

**Choose Your Own Adventure**

### Path A (Idiocracy): Nuclear Winter and 35-Year Lifespans by 2050

**Idiocracy (if we keep funding war) - The Three Subs:**

- 🧠 **Sub-Intelligence**: IQ dropping, education collapsed, eating lead paint for nutrients
- ⏳ **Sub-Longevity**: Life expectancy 35, dying of scurvy like a pirate
- 😢 **Sub-Wellbeing**: 80% mentally ill, constant fear, happiness is illegal
- Nuclear winter by 2050
- Diet: Bugs and bunker rations
- Entertainment: Fighting over water
- WiFi: Terrible

### Path B (Wishonia): Optional Death and Paradise by 2050

**Wishonia (if we fund cures) - The Three Supers:**

- 🧠 **Super-Intelligence**: IQ unlimited, merge with AI, understand Rick & Morty
- ⏳ **Super-Longevity**: Death optional, backups available, respawn enabled
- 😊 **Super-Wellbeing**: Happiness baseline adjustable, suffering extinct, bliss on tap
- Death defeated by 2050 (it retired)
- Life expectancy: "Yes"
- Disease: In museums next to smallpox
- Poverty: Conceptually impossible
- War: "That thing where people murdered each other? Weird."
- WiFi: Telepathic

Your kid gets diagnosed with something unpronounceable.

In Idiocracy: You sell your house, start a GoFundMe, watch her die anyway.

In Wishonia: The doctor uploads her DNA, a computer designs a cure, the pharmacy prints it, she's fine by Thursday. Cost: $0. Because we stopped buying bombs.

Cancer becomes like strep throat, annoying but fixable. Alzheimer's gets deleted. Hearts get upgraded. Death becomes optional, or at least negotiable.

Your great-grandchildren will think we were barbarians. "They let people die of CANCER?" they'll say. "What, did they also drill holes in skulls for headaches?"

Yes, actually. We did that too.

## The Strategy

**How to Pass a Global Treaty in 5 Steps**

{{< include brain/figures/five-step-strategy-flowchart.qmd >}}

### Step 1: VICTORY Bonds

**Raise $1B From Investors**

Remember World War II? America sold war bonds to fund the fight against fascism. People bought them because:

1. They hated Nazis
2. They loved money
3. The government made it patriotic

We're doing the same thing, but for the War on Disease. VICTORY bonds fund the fight against death - with much higher returns than WWII bonds ever offered.

### Step 2: Global Referendum

**Get 280 Million Votes**

Use the bond money to run a massive campaign. Give everyone on Earth a lottery ticket to the future. Call them VOTE points. They're worthless now, but if we win, they become claims on the $16.5 trillion annual peace dividend.

It's like Bitcoin, but instead of wasting electricity, we're saving lives.

Get [3.5% of humanity](./brain/book/references.qmd#3-5-rule) to vote yes on "Do you want to not die?" on redirecting 1% of military spending to fund hyper-efficient decentralized clinical trials.

### Step 3: Legal Lobbying

**Deploy $1B (ROI: 1,813:1)**

The military-industrial complex spends $1 on lobbying and gets [$1,813 back](./brain/book/references.qmd#lobbying-roi-calc) in contracts. It's the best investment in the world, if you don't mind the screaming.

We'll use the same proven lobbying ROI to build a coalition where everyone profits more from cures than disease.

### Step 4: Super PACs

**Fund Treaty Supporters, Replace Opponents**

Create Super PACs in every country. Not to support candidates, to support math. If your district votes 70% for the treaty and you vote against it, we fund your opponent with spreadsheets and bar graphs.


### Step 5: End War and Disease

{{< include brain/figures/success-spiral-flowchart.qmd >}}

Gradually moving toward a world with less and less war and more and more cures:

- **1% Treaty** ($27B) → First major cures → Media attention → More public support
- **2% Treaty** ($54B) → Accelerated breakthroughs → Paradigm shift → Massive momentum
- **5% Treaty** ($135B) → Disease eradication → Victory declared → Universal support
- **50%+ Budget** → Humanity permanently prioritizes healing over killing

---

## The Investment

**Targeting 270% Annual Returns for Saving Humanity**

### VICTORY Bonds

**Better Returns Than Cocaine Trafficking (And Legal)**

**This is a high-risk, venture-style investment targeting 270% annual returns. Perpetually.**

Think of it as the ultimate asymmetric bet. If we fail, you lose your investment. But if we fail, you'll also die.  In which case, you won't have the ability to care about the money you lost.

Better than:

- Warren Buffett (20%)
- Index funds (10%) 
- Cocaine Trafficking (90% but risky)
- Your cousin's crypto scheme (-100%)

{{< include brain/figures/victory-bonds-roi-projection-bar-chart.qmd >}}

### Investment Thesis

**How You Get 270% Returns Forever**

{{< include brain/figures/victory-bonds-money-flow-diagram.qmd >}}

**The math:** Raise $1B → Redirect $27B annually → Investors get 10% of treaty inflows → $2.7B/year forever.

### Persuading Special Interests

**Everyone Profits More From Cures Than Forever Wars**

**Defense Contractors**: "Wait, we can make 270% returns instead of 8% margins? And keep 99% of our military budget? Where do we sign?"

**Insurance Companies**: Every cure = billions they don't pay out. They're literally betting on you not dying. Finally, aligned incentives!

**Big Pharma**: Here's the beautiful part. Instead of burning $48,000 per patient in trials, patients now PAY THEM (covered by DIH subsidies). From biggest expense to revenue stream.

**Politicians**: We create Super PACs. Vote for the treaty or we fund your opponent with bar graphs showing you hate grandmas with cancer.

**Billionaires**: 270% returns. Your current wealth becomes a rounding error.

**Poor People**: Don't die of preventable diseases (revolutionary concept)

**You**: Don't suffer and die.

**Death**: Gets fired

---

## Join or Die (Literally)

![Join or Die Snake](assets/join-or-die-snake.jpg)

Humanity spends **$118.8 trillion a year** on war and disease.

We're asking for **1% of the military budget**. The military keeps 99% - enough to end the world 66 times instead of 67.

This isn't liberal or conservative. It's math.

The people in charge aren't evil. They just like money. So we're making saving lives more profitable than ending them.

The choice is binary: Continue our death march toward mutual annihilation, or redirect 1% toward universal flourishing.
