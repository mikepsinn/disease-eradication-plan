            <h2>THE STUPIDLY SIMPLE MATH</h2>
            <p>Countries spend <strong>$2.7 trillion</strong> annually perfecting ways to make humans stop breathing.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">You're asking them to redirect <strong>1%</strong> ($27B) to make humans keep breathing.<br>They still have enough bombs to end civilization 19 times instead of 20.<br>It's like asking a serial killer to use 99 bullets instead of 100.</p>

        <!-- BENEFITS -->
        <div class="benefits">
            <h3>HOW THIS ACTUALLY WORKS (NO REALLY):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>YOUR BODY:</strong> Currently dissolving. Cancer cells multiplying. Brain deleting memories. You're a meat robot with worn-out parts.</li>
                <li><strong>THE PROBLEM:</strong> We spend 40X more on murder than medicine. The Pentagon lost $2.5 trillion. Not spent. Lost. Like change in a couch the size of Nebraska.</li>
                <li><strong>THE HACK:</strong> Get 3.5% of humanity to vote (historically never fails). Politicians love their jobs more than bombs.</li>
                <li><strong>THE RESULT:</strong> Oxford proved trials cost $500 instead of $41,000. That's 82X cheaper. Math doesn't lie, politicians do.</li>
            </ul>

        <!-- INSTRUCTION MANUAL -->
        <div class="proposition" style="margin-top: 40px;">
            <h2>YOUR STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO ENDING DEATH</h2>
            <p><strong>STEP 1: REALIZE YOU'RE ALREADY DYING</strong><br>
            Your telomeres are shortening. Your cells are mutating. You have about 700,000 hours left. Tick tock.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>STEP 2: UNDERSTAND THE SCAM</strong><br>
            After WW2, we cut military spending by 30% and accidentally created the greatest economic boom in history. You're only asking for 1%. Even Congress can do that math.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>STEP 3: LEARN FROM HISTORY</strong><br>
            Every movement that got 3.5% of the population involved succeeded. Every. Single. One. That's just math. Not ideology. Math.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>STEP 4: DO THE BARE MINIMUM</strong><br>
            Vote below. Share your pyramid code. Get 3 friends. When 280 million people do this, politicians will cave faster than a house of cards in a hurricane.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>THE PAYOFF:</strong><br>
            463:1 return on investment. That's better than smallpox eradication (280:1). It's better than cocaine trafficking (90:1). It's capitalism's redemption arc.</p>

        <div class="benefits" style="margin-top: 40px;">
            <h3>PROOF THIS ISN'T A FEVER DREAM:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>OXFORD DID IT:</strong> The RECOVERY trial cost $500 per patient instead of $41,000. Not in theory. With actual dying people who became not-dying people.</li>
                <li><strong>SWITZERLAND EXISTS:</strong> They spend 0.7% on defense and have the highest quality of life on Earth. Proof you can be rich, healthy, AND boring.</li>
                <li><strong>THE PENTAGON LOST $2.5 TRILLION:</strong> Not spent. Lost. If they can lose that much, they can redirect 1%.</li>
                <li><strong>DEFENSE CONTRACTORS WANT THIS:</strong> 270% returns beat their pathetic lobbying ROI of 181,300%. Even warmongers like money.</li>
            </ul>
