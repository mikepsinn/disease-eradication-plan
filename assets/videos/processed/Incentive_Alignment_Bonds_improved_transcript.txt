[0.0-3.6] Have you ever looked at the news and just wondered why some common sense policies,
[3.6-5.8] you know, the ones that would create massive public benefits,
[5.8-7.5] the ones most people actually support?
[7.8-9.2] Just never seem to happen.
[9.6-11.5] It's a huge puzzle in modern democracy.
[11.7-14.2] Well, today we're diving into a fascinating idea,
[14.5-16.9] a mechanism designed to solve that exact problem.
[17.4-20.4] Now, I know this sounds super cynical to just come out and say,
[20.4-22.2] your opinion doesn't count in politics,
[22.5-24.6] but according to a major academic study,
[24.6-26.0] it's alarmingly close to the truth.
[26.4-29.0] Researchers looked at decades of US policy decisions,
[29.0-33.4] and they came to a pretty stark conclusion about how much influence the average citizen really has.
[33.9-37.1] And this chart, wow, it just lays it all out.
[37.4-42.4] Researchers, Martin Gillens and Benjamin Page went through almost 1800 different policy decisions.
[42.7-44.2] And what they found is right here.
[44.5-50.4] Look at the bar for average citizens, whether a policy had 0% public support or 100% public support,
[50.6-54.1] it's chance of becoming law pretty much flatlines at around 30%.
[54.4-55.8] It just doesn't move.
[56.1-58.8] But now look at the preferences of economic elites.
[59.2-62.9] As their support goes up, boom, so does the chance of a policy passing.
[63.3-64.4] The data is pretty clear.
[64.4-67.6] Your opinion has almost no statistical impact on policy.
[68.2-69.2] So why?
[69.4-70.4] Why does this happen?
[70.8-73.7] Well, the economist Mansier Olsen explained it perfectly.
[74.0-77.8] It's basically a battle between two different kinds of interests.
[78.1-84.2] On one side, you have these small, incredibly organized groups with a ton to gain or lose for each individual.
[84.5-88.2] You know, think of an industry lobbyist fighting for one specific regulation.
[88.7-91.6] And on the other side, well, that's the general public.
[91.9-97.2] We're a massive group, but for any single issue, the stakes for each of us individually are tiny,
[97.5-99.9] which makes it almost impossible to get organized.
[100.3-104.2] And in that fight, the small, motivated group wins almost every time.
[104.9-108.0] Okay, so if the problem isn't necessarily bad people,
[108.0-112.9] but a system that has bad incentives, then what if we could hack those incentives?
[113.1-115.8] What if we could actually make supporting the public good,
[115.8-119.8] the most rational, self-interested choice a politician could possibly make?
[120.6-123.4] Yeah, that really is the billion dollar question, isn't it?
[123.8-127.1] And the paper we're looking at today offers a pretty radical and fascinating answer.
[127.4-129.7] It's something called an incentive alignment bond.
[130.6-137.4] At its core, an incentive alignment bond or an IAB is a tool that's designed to just completely flip the script.
[137.7-142.8] It's a way to create powerful, concentrated benefits for politicians who vote for policies that have these broad,
[142.8-144.5] diffuse public benefits.
[144.5-147.7] It's all about aligning their personal incentives with the public good.
[148.6-149.7] So how does it work?
[149.7-151.1] Well, it's pretty clever.
[151.5-155.0] It creates this kind of self-reinforcing loop with three key features.
[155.6-157.4] First, you align investors.
[157.4-160.7] They only make a profit if the public good policy actually gets passed.
[161.4-163.1] Second, you align the politicians.
[163.5-165.8] They get tangible career benefits for supporting it.
[166.1-168.8] And third, and this part is absolutely critical.
[169.0-174.1] The whole system is funded by redirecting money from less effective or even harmful government programs.
[175.0-181.0] Okay, so that's the big idea, but you're probably thinking how on earth does this actually work in practice
[181.0-182.7] without being, you know, illegal?
[183.3-187.0] Well, the answer lies in this really smart, three-layer architecture.
[187.8-191.6] It all kicks off with data, just pure, simple data.
[192.2-195.4] Layer 1 is an independent nonpartisan research group,
[195.4-199.3] kind of like the League of Conservation Voters that creates a public scorecard.
[199.3-204.2] It just tracks and rates politicians based on how they vote on a specific public good issue.
[204.2-208.5] It's totally objective, it's transparent, and it's all based on public information.
[209.1-212.9] Layer 2 is where that score gets connected to real political power.
[213.4-218.0] You have independent groups, like SuperPacks, who publicly announce, way ahead of time,
[218.0-223.1] something like, we are going to spend $20 million supporting any candidate from any party,
[223.1-226.6] whose score is above a 75 on the public good scorecard.
[226.6-230.9] All of a sudden you've created a really powerful and direct incentive to get a good score.
[231.8-235.8] And finally, layer 3 aligns their long-term career path.
[235.8-239.8] prestigious foundations or think tanks can announce that getting a high score is a key factor
[239.8-244.1] for landing those lucrative fellowships or board seats after a politician leaves office.
[244.1-247.9] This basically co-ops that whole revolving door between government and the private sector,
[247.9-249.9] but points it in the direction of public service.
[250.6-255.0] Now the first question pretty much everyone asks is, wait a minute, isn't that just bribery?
[255.0-257.8] And that is a crucial point, so let's look at the legal distinction.
[258.6-261.5] bribery is a private secret deal for a specific vote.
[261.5-262.6] It's a quid pro quo.
[263.1-265.5] This IAB system is the complete opposite.
[265.5-268.6] It's public, it's universal, meaning it applies to everyone,
[268.6-272.2] and it's based on pre-announced rules that reward a whole class of policies,
[272.2-273.4] not just one specific vote.
[274.1-278.0] Legally, this is way closer to how groups like the NRA or major environmental organizations
[278.0-278.6] already work.
[279.6-281.7] So this brings us to the money.
[281.7-284.3] To make this whole thing work, you need investors.
[284.3-285.9] But why would they fund this?
[285.9-290.7] Well, it turns out influencing politics is already the most profitable game in town.
[291.6-295.0] This quote from the source material just completely reframes the issue.
[295.5-300.2] It says, political advocacy isn't charity, it's a high yield asset class.
[300.8-306.2] The money spent to influence policy isn't a donation, it's an investment with returns that can
[306.2-308.7] absolutely dwarf anything you'd see in the stock market.
[309.4-312.9] ABS are just a way to open up this asset class to fund public goods.
[313.6-315.6] I mean, just look at this number.
[315.6-317.1] It is insane.
[317.1-321.5] According to one analysis, for every single dollar, the top five defense contractors
[321.5-326.0] spent on lobbying, they got back over $180,000 in government contracts.
[326.0-328.2] That's an 181,000% return.
[328.2-331.6] The ROI on political influence is astronomical.
[331.6-335.3] AIBs just want to capture a tiny piece of that value for public benefit.
[336.2-338.7] And here's another really critical point.
[338.7-341.0] This is not about printing more money.
[341.0-345.7] Just adding new spending often gets eaten up by inflation or deficit spending?
[345.7-346.3] No.
[346.3-350.2] The real power of an IAB comes from redirecting funds.
[350.2-354.7] You take money from a program that gives us little or even negative social value
[354.7-357.8] and you move it to one that provides huge positive value.
[358.3-361.5] And this table just makes the concept crystal clear.
[361.5-365.8] The source material actually ranks government spending by its net social value.
[365.8-370.5] So look here, spending a dollar on fossil fuel subsidies is estimated to create a net social
[370.5-374.3] loss of over $4 because of externalities like climate change.
[374.3-376.6] But now, look at the other end of the spectrum.
[376.6-382.6] Every dollar we spend on medical research can generate anywhere from $3 to over $100 in social value.
[382.6-384.3] The IAB's goal is simple.
[384.3-387.7] Fund the political will to move money from the bottom of this list to the top.
[388.4-393.8] So once you have a mechanism like this, the potential applications are honestly breathtaking.
[393.8-397.7] Imagine applying this tool to some of the world's biggest collective action problems,
[397.7-401.3] incentivizing real, meaningful action on climate change,
[401.3-404.2] making sure we are truly prepared for the next pandemic,
[404.2-407.4] or maybe even making progress on nuclear disarmament.
[407.4-410.6] These are the kinds of problems that feel impossible with our current setup.
[411.4-415.1] And really, that's the final thought this whole idea leaves us with.
[415.1-420.7] It's a tool, a blueprint for hacking our political system to solve problems that seem completely stuck.
[421.3-423.8] It doesn't require us to hope for better politicians.
[423.8-427.8] It just asks us to design a smarter system where their own self-interest
[427.8-429.4] finally aligns with ours.
[429.4-434.3] So it really makes you wonder which impossible problems should we decide to fix first.
