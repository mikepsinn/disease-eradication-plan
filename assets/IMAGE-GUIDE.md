### death-and-dollars-terrorism-comparison.jpg

**File:** `death-and-dollars-terrorism-comparison.jpg`  
**Size:** 102.9 KB | **Format:** JPG | **Dimensions:** 960x320

**Description:** The infographic compares the major causes of death in the US with the federal budget allocation, specifically highlighting the disparity between funding for medical research and military spending. It visualizes the number of deaths per year for various causes (heart disease, cancer, etc.) with corresponding research funding in 2007, then contrasts that with the much larger federal budget pie, where current and past military spending comprises over half of the budget. The infographic uses gravestones to symbolize the causes of death and includes a statement that one is three times more likely to be killed by lightning than by terrorism.

**Keywords:** causes of death, mortality, medical research, military spending, federal budget, budget allocation, healthcare, cancer, heart disease, terrorism

**Size:** 89.1 KB | **Format:** PNG | **Dimensions:** 262x1870

**Description:** This image shows a list of "predictors of overall mood" and their associated percentage change from baseline. Each item on the list indicates whether having more of the predictor (e.g., daily step count) is associated with a higher or lower overall mood score, along with the corresponding percentage change. The image is sorted, and we can see examples like "lack of motivation" being correlated to -12% mood and "Latuda" correlating to +23% mood.
