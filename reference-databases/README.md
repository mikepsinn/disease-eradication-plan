# 📖 Reference Databases

The Unified Health API integrates the disparate health data standards in order to accelerate clinical research.

## Online Data Browser

Contact hello@curedao.org if you desire access.

### [1. Nutritional Supplements](supplement-databases.md)

### [2. Units of Measurement](units.md)

### [3. Medication](medication-databases.md)

### [4. Symptoms and Diseases](diseases.md)

### [5. Observations, Lab Test Results, and Biomarkers](biomarker-databases.md)

### 6. Clinical Trials

[AACT](https://aact.ctti-clinicaltrials.org) is a publicly available relational database that contains all information (protocol and result data elements) about every study registered in ClinicalTrials.gov.

### 7. Medical Codes, Terms, and Synonyms

[The Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t\&rct=j\&q=\&esrc=s\&source=web\&cd=\&cad=rja\&uact=8\&ved=2ahUKEwiP-bmSy8f0AhXxJzQIHZw1DyMQFnoECA4QAQ\&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSystematized\_Nomenclature\_of\_Medicine\&usg=AOvVaw0OEA6yHcGONHJwDX9OrbKc) is a systematic collection of medical codes, terms, synonyms and definitions which cover:

* Anatomy
* Diseases
* Findings
* Procedures
* Microorganisms
* Substances
* Etc.

## Data Schema

### Wearables

* [Open mHealth](https://www.openmhealth.org/documentation/#/schema-docs/schema-library) - Common schemas define the meaningful distinctions for each clinical measure
* [Apple HealthKit](https://github.com/openmhealth/schemas/tree/develop/schema/granola) - A set of schemas for the Apple HealthKit platform

### EHR

* [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) - A standard for electronic health records
* [OpenEHR](https://www.openehr.org) - OpenEHR is a technology for e-health consisting of open platform specifications, clinical models, and software that together define a domain-driven information systems platform for healthcare and medical research.
