# Master Service Agreement
# for the Decentralized Health Research & Development Platform

---

## 1. PARTIES

**The Foundation:** [Your Foundation's Legal Name], a registered 501(c)(3) private foundation ("The Foundation").

**The Contractor:** [Company's Legal Name], a company specializing in advanced software engineering and health technology ("The Contractor").

**Effective Date:** [Date]

## 2. BACKGROUND & NORTH STAR OBJECTIVE

The Foundation's charitable mission is to eradicate dementia and mental illness by accelerating the development of safe and effective treatments. The current system for clinical trials is slow, expensive, and excludes most patients, creating a bottleneck that costs millions of lives and trillions of dollars in economic burden annually.

The Foundation is engaging The Contractor in a long-term strategic partnership to build and operate a global, decentralized health research and development platform. This platform is inspired by the principles of the "Decentralized FDA" (dFDA) and the "War On Disease" initiative, aiming to create a hyper-efficient, patient-centric ecosystem for medical innovation.

This multi-year engagement is not a feasibility study, but the foundational execution of this vision. The ultimate goal is to establish a global public good that transforms how all diseases are studied and cured. All activities and expenditures under this agreement must be exclusively dedicated to the charitable purpose of advancing scientific and medical research, developing publicly accessible technology, and lessening the burden of disease for all of humanity.

## 3. SCOPE OF SERVICES & STRATEGIC PHASES

The Contractor shall provide the expert services required to execute the following multi-phase strategic plan. Each phase builds upon the last, with continued funding contingent upon the successful completion of the prior phase's milestones.

### Phase 1: Strategic Blueprint & Foundational Infrastructure (Year 1)

*   **Objective:** To produce a comprehensive strategic, technical, and legal blueprint while building the core infrastructure necessary for the platform's long-term success, scalability, and compliance.
*   **Key Services & Deliverables:**
    1.  **Health & Economic Impact Analysis:** A formal report modeling the platform's potential to generate Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and reduce healthcare expenditures, establishing the quantitative case for the platform's societal ROI.
    2.  **Technical Architecture & Privacy-Preserving Infrastructure:** A detailed technical blueprint and initial implementation of the high-level, HIPAA-compliant systems architecture. This includes the formal integration of privacy-preserving technologies (e.g., Zero-Knowledge Proofs) for the "Digital Twin Safe," enabling aggregate data analysis without compromising individual privacy.
    3.  **Economic & Governance Model:** A detailed model for the platform's sustainable economy, including the "Dynamic Voucher System" to subsidize patient participation and a governance framework for the decentralized ecosystem.
    4.  **Legal & Regulatory Strategy:** A thorough analysis of the global legal and regulatory landscape (including FDA, GDPR, etc.) with a clear strategy for compliance and a framework for ethical oversight.
    5.  **Public Education & Dissemination Strategy:** A plan for producing and disseminating educational materials to the public, researchers, and clinicians about the principles and benefits of decentralized research, in furtherance of the foundation's educational mission.
    6.  **Phase 2 Implementation Roadmap:** A detailed project plan, budget, and timeline for the platform's pilot launch outlined in Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Platform Launch & Pilot Network (Year 2)

*   **Objective:** To launch a functional core platform, onboard initial partners, and initiate the first pilot studies.
*   **Anticipated Services:** Development and deployment of the core platform, recruitment of an initial cohort of 3-5 academic research partners, and launch of the first pilot decentralized trials.

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Scaling & Network Expansion (Year 3 and beyond)

*   **Objective:** To expand the platform's capabilities, user base, and impact toward becoming a self-sustaining public good.
*   **Anticipated Services:** Onboarding a wider network of research institutions, expanding to additional disease areas, developing advanced AI-driven tools for trial matching and data analysis, and publishing research findings in open-access forums.

## 4. GRANT FUNDING & PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Foundation will provide a total grant of **$475,000** for the successful completion of the services outlined in **Phase 1**. Funding for subsequent phases will be determined by separate amendments to this agreement upon successful completion of the preceding phase.

**Phase 1 Budget Justification:**
The grant amount is designated for securing the highly specialized talent and resources required to execute Phase 1. The Contractor will operate with a lean, agile team, leveraging internal employees and augmented by advanced AI systems to maximize efficiency. The allocation of funds is based on the estimated effort required for a project of this complexity and strategic importance. For illustrative purposes, the cost structure is projected as follows:

*   **Strategic & Technical Leadership:** ~$200,000
    *   *Covers senior personnel for project architecture, product management, and technical oversight.* 
*   **Core Engineering & Data Science:** ~$150,000
    *   *Covers development of the foundational infrastructure, privacy-preserving systems, and data models.*
*   **Specialized Counsel & Analysis:** ~$100,000
    *   *Covers external experts for healthcare regulatory law, health economics, and specialized modeling.*
*   **Administrative & Operational Support:** ~$25,000
    *   *Covers direct administrative costs and overhead (capped at 5.5%).*

This structure provides a framework for expenditure without requiring a direct, auditable link between grant funds and specific employee salaries, offering operational flexibility while ensuring accountability to the project's goals.

**Phase 1 Payment Schedule:**
*   **$125,000** upon execution of this Agreement.
*   **$125,000** upon delivery of the draft Health & Economic Impact Analysis and Technical Architecture.
*   **$125,000** upon delivery of the draft Economic & Governance Model and Legal & Regulatory Strategy.
*   **$100,000** upon The Foundation's written acceptance of all final Phase 1 deliverables.

The Contractor agrees to use these funds exclusively for reasonable and necessary expenses directly related to the Scope of Work.
## 5. REPORTING & EXPENDITURE RESPONSIBILITY

To comply with IRS requirements for expenditure responsibility and ensure full transparency, The Contractor shall:

*   Provide The Foundation with quarterly written reports detailing progress against the objectives and deliverables of the current phase.
*   Provide a financial statement with each report, summarizing expenditures by the major categories outlined in the Budget Justification (e.g., Strategic & Technical Leadership, Core Engineering). This summary should be sufficient to demonstrate that funds are being used in alignment with the project's charitable purpose.
*   Maintain records of all income and expenditures related to this grant for at least four years after completion, sufficient to demonstrate that funds were used exclusively for the charitable purposes outlined in this agreement.
*   Agree to make these records available to The Foundation or its auditors for inspection upon reasonable request.
