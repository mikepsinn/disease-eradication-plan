# Master Service Agreement
# for the Decentralized Dementia & Mental Health Research Platform

---

## 1. PARTIES

**The Foundation:** [Your Foundation's Legal Name], a registered 501(c)(3) private foundation ("The Foundation").

**The Contractor:** [Company's Legal Name], a company specializing in software development and health technology ("The Contractor").

**Effective Date:** [Date]

## 2. BACKGROUND & PURPOSE

The Foundation's charitable mission is to eradicate dementia and mental illness by accelerating the development of safe and effective treatments. The current system for clinical trials is slow, expensive, and excludes most patients, creating a bottleneck that costs millions of lives and trillions of dollars in economic burden annually.

The Foundation is engaging The Contractor to build and operate a software platform based on the principles of the "Decentralized FDA" (dFDA), as outlined in the "War On Disease" initiative. This multi-year engagement aims to create a hyper-efficient, patient-centric marketplace for clinical research, starting with a focus on dementia and mental illness, with the ultimate goal of creating a global public good that transforms how all diseases are studied and cured.

This agreement outlines the terms for a long-term strategic partnership. It covers the initial multi-phase effort to design, build, and launch the foundational platform. All activities and expenditures under this agreement must be exclusively dedicated to the charitable purpose of advancing scientific and medical research, developing publicly accessible technology for that purpose, and lessening the burden of disease for all of humanity.

## 3. SCOPE OF WORK & DELIVERABLES

The Contractor shall perform the services required to execute the following multi-phase plan. Each phase is designed to build upon the last, with continued funding contingent upon the successful completion of the prior phase's deliverables.

### Phase 1: Foundational Architecture & Strategic Roadmap (Year 1)

*   **Objective:** To produce a comprehensive strategic, technical, and legal framework that ensures the platform's long-term success, scalability, and compliance.
*   **Deliverables:**
    1.  **Health & Economic Impact Analysis:** A formal report modeling the platform's potential to generate Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) and reduce healthcare expenditures within the dementia and mental illness domains.
    2.  **Technical Architecture & Privacy Blueprint:** A detailed technical document specifying the high-level, HIPAA-compliant systems architecture. This includes a formal evaluation and recommendation of privacy-preserving technologies (e.g., Zero-Knowledge Proofs, Homomorphic Encryption) for the "Digital Twin Safe" concept, ensuring patient data can be used for research in aggregate without compromising individual privacy.
    3.  **Economic Sustainability Model:** A detailed model for the "Dynamic Voucher System" to sustainably subsidize patient participation in trials, ensuring equitable access.
    4.  **Legal & Regulatory Roadmap:** A thorough analysis of the legal and regulatory landscape (including FDA, GDPR, etc.) with a clear strategy for compliance and a framework for ethical oversight.
    5.  **Educational & Dissemination Plan:** A strategy for producing and disseminating educational materials to the public, researchers, and clinicians about the principles and benefits of decentralized research, in furtherance of the foundation's educational mission.
    6.  **Phase 2 Implementation Plan:** A detailed project plan, budget, and timeline for the MVP development outlined in Phase 2.

### Phase 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Development & Pilot Launch (Year 2)

*   **Objective:** To build, test, and launch a functional core platform and initiate the first pilot studies.
*   **Anticipated Services:**
    *   Development and deployment of the core dFDA platform.
    *   Integration of the "Digital Twin Safe" and privacy-preserving data analysis features.
    *   Recruitment of an initial cohort of 3-5 academic research partners.
    *   Launch of the first pilot decentralized trials on the platform.

### Phase 3: Platform Scaling & Network Expansion (Year 3 and beyond)

*   **Objective:** To expand the platform's capabilities, user base, and impact.
*   **Anticipated Services:**
    *   Onboarding a wider network of research institutions and commercial sponsors.
    *   Expanding the platform to include additional disease areas.
    *   Developing advanced AI-driven tools for trial matching and data analysis.
    *   Publishing initial findings from platform-enabled research in open-access forums.

## 4. GRANT FUNDING & PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Foundation will provide a total grant of **$475,000** for the successful completion of the services outlined in **Phase 1**. Funding for subsequent phases will be determined by separate amendments to this agreement upon successful completion of the preceding phase.
