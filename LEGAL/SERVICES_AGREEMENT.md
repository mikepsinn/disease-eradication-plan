# Master Service Agreement
# for the Decentralized Health Research & Development Platform

---

## 1. PARTIES

**The Foundation:** [Your Foundation's Legal Name], a registered 501(c)(3) private foundation ("The Foundation").

**The Contractor:** [Company's Legal Name], a company specializing in advanced software engineering and health technology ("The Contractor").

**Effective Date:** [Date]

## 2. BACKGROUND & NORTH STAR OBJECTIVE

The Foundation's charitable mission is to eradicate dementia and mental illness by accelerating the development of safe and effective treatments. The current system for clinical trials is slow, expensive, and excludes most patients, creating a bottleneck that costs millions of lives and trillions of dollars in economic burden annually.

The Foundation is engaging The Contractor in a long-term strategic partnership to build and operate a global, decentralized health research and development platform. This platform is inspired by the principles of the "Decentralized FDA" (dFDA) and the "War On Disease" initiative, aiming to create a hyper-efficient, patient-centric ecosystem for medical innovation.

This multi-year engagement is not a feasibility study, but the foundational execution of this vision. The ultimate goal is to establish a global public good that transforms how all diseases are studied and cured. All activities and expenditures under this agreement must be exclusively dedicated to the charitable purpose of advancing scientific and medical research, developing publicly accessible technology, and lessening the burden of disease for all of humanity.

## 3. SCOPE OF SERVICES & STRATEGIC PHASES

## 4. GRANT FUNDING & PAYMENT SCHEDULE

The Foundation will provide a total grant of **$475,000** for the successful completion of the services outlined in **Phase 1**. Funding for subsequent phases will be determined by separate amendments to this agreement upon successful completion of the preceding phase.

**Phase 1 Budget Justification:**
The grant amount is designated for securing the highly specialized talent and resources required to execute Phase 1's comprehensive scope. The Contractor will operate with a lean, agile team, leveraging internal employees and augmented by advanced AI systems to maximize efficiency and output. The allocation of funds is based on the estimated effort required for a project of this technical complexity and strategic importance. For illustrative purposes, the cost structure is projected as follows:

*   **Strategic & Technical Leadership:** ~$180,000
    *   *Covers senior personnel for overall project architecture, product management, and technical oversight across all workstreams.* 
*   **Core Platform Engineering:** ~$140,000
    *   *Covers development of the foundational dFDA infrastructure, privacy-preserving systems (Zero-Knowledge Proofs), security protocols, and API integrations.*
*   **AI & Data Science Systems:** ~$80,000
    *   *Covers design and prototyping of AI-driven clinical intelligence, treatment matching algorithms, and predictive safety models.*
*   **Wishocracy Platform Development:** ~$60,000
    *   *Covers design and prototyping of the democratic allocation interface, identity verification, and aggregation algorithms.*
*   **Specialized Legal & Economic Analysis:** ~$80,000
    *   *Covers external experts for healthcare regulatory law, international treaty framework research, health economics modeling, and insurance pool design.*
*   **Educational Content Production:** ~$40,000
    *   *Covers creation of white papers, training materials, patient education content, and multimedia resources.*
*   **Infrastructure & Tools:** ~$35,000
    *   *Covers cloud infrastructure, development tools, security auditing, and testing environments.*
*   **Administrative & Operational Support:** ~$25,000
    *   *Covers direct administrative costs and overhead (capped at 5.3%).*

This structure provides a framework for expenditure without requiring a direct, auditable link between grant funds and specific employee salaries, offering operational flexibility while ensuring accountability to the project's goals.

**Phase 1 Payment Schedule:**
*   **$120,000** upon execution of this Agreement.
*   **$120,000** upon delivery of the draft Health & Economic Impact Analysis, Technical Architecture, and AI Systems Design.
*   **$120,000** upon delivery of the draft Wishocracy Platform Design, Economic Model, and Insurance Framework.
*   **$115,000** upon The Foundation's written acceptance of all final Phase 1 deliverables, including educational materials and implementation roadmap.

The Contractor agrees to use these funds exclusively for reasonable and necessary expenses directly related to the Scope of Work.
## 5. REPORTING & EXPENDITURE RESPONSIBILITY

To comply with IRS requirements for expenditure responsibility and ensure full transparency, The Contractor shall:

*   Provide The Foundation with quarterly written reports detailing progress against the objectives and deliverables of the current phase.
*   Provide a financial statement with each report, summarizing expenditures by the major categories outlined in the Budget Justification (e.g., Strategic & Technical Leadership, Core Engineering). This summary should be sufficient to demonstrate that funds are being used in alignment with the project's charitable purpose.

This includes, but is not limited to, participating in any political campaign on behalf of (or in opposition to) any candidate for public office, attempting to influence legislation (lobbying), or for grants to individuals for travel or study without prior written approval from the Foundation.

## 6. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
To ensure the maximum public benefit of this charitable grant, all software, reports, documentation, and other materials developed under this agreement ("Work Product") shall be treated as follows:

*   **Public Licensing:** All software developed shall be released under a permissive open-source license (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0). All reports and documentation shall be released under a Creative Commons license (e.g., CC-BY) to encourage broad dissemination and use.
