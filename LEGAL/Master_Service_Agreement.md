# Master Service Agreement
# for the Decentralized Health Research & Development Platform

---

## 1. PARTIES

**The Foundation:** [Your Foundation's Legal Name], a registered 501(c)(3) private foundation ("The Foundation").

**The Contractor:** [Company's Legal Name], a company specializing in advanced software engineering and health technology ("The Contractor").

**Effective Date:** [Date]

## 2. BACKGROUND & NORTH STAR OBJECTIVE

The Foundation's charitable mission is to eradicate dementia and mental illness by accelerating the development of safe and effective treatments. The current system for clinical trials is slow, expensive, and excludes most patients, creating a bottleneck that costs millions of lives and trillions of dollars in economic burden annually.

The Foundation is engaging The Contractor in a long-term strategic partnership to build and operate a global, decentralized health research and development platform. This platform is inspired by the principles of the "Decentralized FDA" (dFDA) and the "War On Disease" initiative, aiming to create a hyper-efficient, patient-centric ecosystem for medical innovation.

This multi-year engagement is not a feasibility study, but the foundational execution of this vision. The ultimate goal is to establish a global public good that transforms how all diseases are studied and cured. All activities and expenditures under this agreement must be exclusively dedicated to the charitable purpose of advancing scientific and medical research, developing publicly accessible technology, and lessening the burden of disease for all of humanity.

## 3. SCOPE OF SERVICES & STATEMENTS OF WORK

The Contractor shall provide the expert services required to execute the multi-phase strategic plan. The specific services, deliverables, timelines, and budgets for each phase of the project will be detailed in separate Statement of Work ("SOW") documents, which shall be executed by both parties and attached as addenda to this Agreement. Each SOW, once executed, is incorporated herein by reference.

The initial engagement shall be governed by SOW-01: Strategic Blueprint.

## 4. GRANT FUNDING & PAYMENT

Funding for the services shall be provided on a per-SOW basis. The total grant amount, budget justification, and payment schedule for the work to be performed will be specified in each respective SOW. The Contractor agrees to use all funds exclusively for the reasonable and necessary expenses directly related to the Scope of Work defined in the active SOW.

This summary should be sufficient to demonstrate that funds are being used in alignment with the project's charitable purpose.
*   Maintain records of all income and expenditures related to this grant for at least four years after completion, sufficient to demonstrate that funds were used exclusively for the charitable purposes outlined in this agreement.
*   Agree to make these records available to The Foundation or its auditors for inspection upon reasonable request.
