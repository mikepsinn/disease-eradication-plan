## Imagine if we could automate clinical research!

## The cost savings from automating clinical research could make the next part of that chart look like this:

# How it Works

We make some super-intelligent robot doctors with the following neat features:

### 1\. Automated Data Collection

![](https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/video/import.gif)

#### Import from Wearables and Apps

It should be effortless for patients to import their data from lots of apps and wearable devices like physical activity, sleep, environmental factors, and vital signs.

#### Browser AI Agents

Patients should be able to use browser-based autonomous AI agents to collect their diet data from services like Instacart, supplement purchases from Amazon, CVS prescriptions, Quest lab results, etc.

#### Manual Data Collection

Patients should be able to easily record any symptom severities, foods, treatments, or anything in a simple reminder inbox.

#### Data from Speech

Patients who prefer talking over messing around with apps should be able to talk to the FDAi. This would also allow passive inference of cognitive and emotional data.

#### Images to Data

Patients should be able to easily record any symptom severities, foods, treatments, or anything in a simple reminder inbox.

#### Notifications

Patients should be able to use web and mobile notifications with action buttons can be used to track symptoms and factors in a fraction of a second.

### _2\. Automated Data_

# Analysis

After the FDAi gets a few months of data, it should provide patients with Root Cause Analyses for their conditions, telling them how much different medications, supplements, or foods might improve or worsen their symptoms:

### _Automated Causal_

# Inference

As any obnoxious college graduate will tell you, correlation does not necessarily imply causation.  
  
Just because you took a drug and got better, it doesn't mean that's really why your symptoms went away. Even in randomized controlled trials hundreds of other things are changing in your life and diet.  
  
So, our FDAi must apply Hill's 6 Criteria for Causality to infer if something causes a symptom to worsen or improve instead of just seeing what correlates with the change.

##### Personal

# Studies

For instance, when gluten-sensitive people eat delicious gluten, it usually takes about a 2-day onset delay before they start having symptoms. Then, when they stop eating it, there's usually a 10-day duration of action before their gut heals and their symptoms improve.

##### Onset Delays

One example of causal inference involves applying forward and reverse lagging of the depression and exercise data. The result suggests a causal relationship based on the temporal precedence of physical activity.

##### _Discovering_

# Cumulative Effects

###### The FDAi should also compare the outcome over various durations following the exposure to see if there is a long-term cumulative effect or if it's just a short-term acute effect. Acute effects are probably obvious already. This analysis suggests that the mood benefits of regular exercise may continue to accumulate after at least a month of above-average exercise.

## Real-Time Decision Support

This data will then make it possible to provide real time decision support to tell us the most important we can do at any given time to treat or prevent disease.

### 3\. _Effortless Trial_

# Participation

### through automated:

#### 1\. Trial Search

If you're one of the inadequately treated 2 billion chronically ill and nothing else has worked for you, it should find you the most promising new treatment available.

#### 2\. Trial Enrollment

If you want to participate, it should automatically enroll you and get the treatment shipped to you or whatever.

#### 3\. Data Collection

The FDAi should automatically schedule all the tests and collect all the data to determine the safety and efficacy of the treatment.

#### 4\. Data Analysis and Publishing

The FDAi should then analyze and anonymize the data and publish the results for everyone.

## Citizen Science

Anyone should be able to create a study, become a prestigious scientist, get a link, and invite all their friends to join!

[Create Study](https://safe.fdai.earth/app/public/#/app/study-creation)

![](https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/video/create-study-1024x899.gif)

##### Global Scale Studies

should be published in a Wikipedia for clinical research based on everyone's data listing the likely effects of every food and drug.

[Current Studies](https://studies.fdai.earth/)

![](https://static.crowdsourcingcures.org/video/clinipedia-landing.gif)

## Mega-Studies

should allow anyone to look up their condition and see how different foods, drugs and supplements tend to improve or worsen their condition for the average person.

[Example Mega-Study](https://studies.fdai.earth/variables/Overall_Mood)

## Outcome Labels

should be available for all foods and drugs that tell us precisely how they'll affect us instead of just how much Riboflavin is in them.
