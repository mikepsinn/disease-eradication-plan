# Organizational Precedents & Staffing Models

This document analyzes the organizational structures of three successful entities that serve as precedents for the DIH. By understanding how they are staffed and organized, we can provide a credible, real-world justification for our own [Hiring Plan](../careers/hiring-plan.md).

The DIH is a hybrid organization that combines the functions of all three:
1.  **The Global Fund:** A massive, multi-billion dollar public health funding institution.
2.  **The ICBL:** A nimble, decentralized global political advocacy campaign.
3.  **MakerDAO:** A decentralized, on-chain financial protocol.

## 1. Precedent: The Global Fund (The Financial Institution)

**Model:** The Global Fund is a financial institution disguised as a public health organization. It does not implement programs directly. Instead, its core function is to raise and deploy capital at massive scale (~$5B/year). Its organizational structure reflects this focus on finance, risk management, and grant administration.

**Approximate Staff Size:** ~700-800 people in its central Secretariat in Geneva.

**Illustrative Org Chart & Key Roles:**
*   **Executive Office:** Executive Director, Chief of Staff.
*   **Grant Management Division (Largest team):**
    *   Fund Portfolio Managers (by region: Africa, Asia, etc.)
    *   Health Finance Specialists
    *   Monitoring & Evaluation Specialists
*   **Finance & Administration Division:**
    *   Chief Financial Officer
    *   Controllers & Accountants
    *   Treasury & Risk Management Teams
    *   Procurement & Supply Chain Specialists
*   **Strategy & Policy Division:**
    *   Public Health Experts
    *   Economists
    *   Policy & Strategy Advisors
*   **External Relations & Communications Division:**
    *   Fundraising & Donor Relations Teams
    *   Government Affairs & Lobbyists
    *   Communications & Media Relations
*   **Legal & Governance:**
    *   General Counsel
    *   Board Relations Team

**Relevance to DIH:** The Global Fund's structure provides a proven blueprint for the team required to manage the **DIH Treasury (Phase 3)**. Our CFO, CCO, Treasury Operations, and Program Officer roles are directly analogous to the core functions of The Global Fund's Secretariat.

## 2. Precedent: The ICBL (The Political Campaign)

**Model:** The ICBL was not a large, centralized organization. It was a lean, decentralized network of NGOs that coordinated a global political campaign. Its power came from its moral authority and its ability to mobilize a vast network, not a large internal headcount.

**Approximate Staff Size:** A very small core team (likely < 20 people) responsible for coordination, with the bulk of the work done by partner organizations.

**Illustrative Org Chart & Key Roles:**
*   **Coordination Team / Secretariat:**
    *   Campaign Director / Coordinator
    *   Communications Lead
    *   Regional Liaisons (to coordinate with partner NGOs)
    *   Diplomatic & UN Liaison
*   **Advisory Board / Steering Committee:** Composed of leaders from the major partner NGOs.
*   **The Network:** Thousands of volunteers and staff at hundreds of partner NGOs around the world who performed the actual in-country advocacy.

**Relevance to DIH:** The ICBL's lean, decentralized structure is the model for the **DIH's political campaign (Phases 1 & 2)**. Our Head of Political Strategy, Elections Compliance Lead, and Regional Campaign Directors are the modern, more heavily capitalized version of the ICBL's core coordination team. We are, in effect, running a professionalized, well-funded ICBL.

## 3. Precedent: MakerDAO (The Decentralized Protocol)

**Model:** MakerDAO is a software protocol, not a traditional company. It has no CEO, no central office, and no formal employees in the traditional sense. It is governed by a global community of token holders and powered by a network of independent, self-organized "Core Units" that receive funding from the DAO.

**Approximate Staff Size:** ~100-150 full-time contributors across all Core Units.

**Illustrative "Org Chart" (Core Units):**
*   **Engineering Core Unit:** Smart contract development and maintenance.
*   **Risk Core Unit:** Financial risk analysis and parameter adjustments.
*   **Oracles Core Unit:** Manages the data feeds that the protocol relies on.
*   **Growth Core Unit:** Works on partnerships and adoption.
*   **Governance & Facilitation Core Unit:** Manages the governance process, runs community calls, and organizes voting.
*   **Real-World Finance Core Unit:** Works on integrating traditional assets into the protocol.
*   **Community & Communications Core Unit:** Manages public communications and community channels.

**Relevance to DIH:** MakerDAO provides the blueprint for how the DIH will operate in its **mature, fully decentralized state (post-Phase 3)**. Our Head of Governance / DAO Facilitator role is directly modeled on MakerDAO's successful Governance Core Unit. The long-term vision is for the DIH's core functions to be managed by a similar network of independent, specialized teams funded by the DIH treasury itself.
