### 5.9 Conclusions

In considering the conclusions that may be drawn based on our evaluation of barrier mitigation strategies, it is important to recognize that establishing clear links between barriers and specific model parameters and their ex-post magnitudes requires extensive research, and our analysis was constrained by the limited availability of this type of information in the literature. Nevertheless, our results can help to inform the discussion surrounding possible barrier mitigation strategies and their relative impacts on drug development costs and returns. Our results are summarized in Table 10 below.

According to our model, priority review vouchers and improvements in FDA review efficiency can help to shorten timelines and increase expected NPV to the drug sponsor. However, these strategies do not reduce the cash outlay needed for the clinical studies. Therefore, holding everything constant, these options may be less appealing as strategies to stimulate drug development than alternatives which substantially lower costs, especially early on in the clinical research process (i.e., in earlier phases).

Use of lower-cost facilities/in-home testing and wider use of mobile technologies appear to be most effective in reducing costs across therapeutic areas and trial phases. Use of lower-cost facilities and/or in-home testing can reduce per-trial costs by up to $0.8 million (16 percent) in Phase 1, $4.3 million (22 percent) in Phase 2, and $9.1 million (17 percent) in Phase 3, depending on therapeutic area. Wider use of mobile technologies can result in very similar maximum savings; $0.4 million (8 percent) in Phase 1, $2.4 million (12 percent) in Phase 2, $6.1 million (12 percent) in Phase 3, and $6.7 million (13 percent) in Phase 4. On the other hand, relaxing trial enrollment restrictions and reducing SDV efforts have smaller impacts on costs, resulting in maximum savings of less than $0.1 million to $0.2 million per trial, representing around one percent of study costs.

Notes: “Minimum” and “maximum” define the range of _savings_ across all therapeutic areas. Cost savings are shown as negative values. \[a\] Mitigation of the barrier reduces FDA review phase duration thereby reducing time to market for the drug. This improved the revenue stream for the sponsor but does not have direct cost impacts in the model.

## Appendix A: Draft Interview GUIDE<sup>14,15</sup>

**Company Name:** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Company Sector:** Pharmaceutical / Biotechnology

**Company Size:** Small / Large (based on revenue / number of employees)

**QUESTIONS<sup>16</sup>**

**1 DECISION-MAKING**

Our first set of questions is related to the decision-making process that you use for determining (a) whether to undertake a clinical trial, and (b) how that trial will be designed and executed. We should point out that **we are only interested in the decision-making process for clinical trials evaluating safety and efficacy for new molecular entities (NMEs).** Clinical trials that you may undertake for marketing, reimbursement, and/or investor objectives are outside the scope of our study.

1. Is there a minimum rate of return that you require before initiating clinical research for an NME? If so, what is it?
2. Is there a minimum revenue threshold below which you might choose to ignore even high-return drug development projects? If so, what is the threshold?
3. If interviewee has small company experience: How does this picture change for small companies?
4. Do you think it is important to reduce current source data verification costs? Does your firm employ risk-based or some other form of SDV at less than 100%?
5. What percentage of laboratory/radiological/physical exam data collected during the course of a clinical trial is never used for the purposes of supporting the New Drug Application (NDA) to FDA? Please elaborate on the reasons for collecting such data.
6. For what percentage of clinical trials that you discuss with FDA do they request a material change in your clinical trial protocol? What percentage of the changes requested by FDA is (1) reasonable, (2) uncertain of their value, (3) unreasonable or not useful? Can you describe some of the specific issues, if possible? _\[Note: Information will be redacted in order not to identify individual companies. If possible, probe about a recent clinical trial experience for more specifics.\]_
7. Does your firm incur substantial costs trying to identify biomarkers during clinical trials? Does the search often prove successful? If so, how important are the clinical trial costs savings from having identified biomarkers? In which specific therapeutic areas are biomarkers relevant? Our final questions relate to the barriers that may delay, hinder, or prevent successful completion of clinical trials for NMEs.
8. From your perspective, what are the major barriers to undertaking clinical research in the U.S. for the purposes of demonstrating safety and efficacy to the FDA? How would you rank these in order of relative importance, top to bottom? \[If the respondent is unable to offer much, suggest factors such as difficulty of mounting clinical trials, uncertainty about the regulatory approval process, shortage of trained professional staff, etc.\]
9. Is your firm actively pursuing the use of newer electronic data capture technologies or other technological advances into clinical trial operation? How important or unimportant do you think such techniques will be in lowering clinical trial costs in the future?
10. Do you feel that, as a (small/large) firm, you face a different set of barriers compared to (larger/smaller) firms? Additionally, do firms in your therapeutic area face a different set of barriers compared to those in other therapeutic areas? If so, what are the differences?
11. In your experience, have you been asked to amend your clinical trial protocol by FDA? If yes, to what extent have the FDA-initiated protocol amendments troublesome or expensive to accommodate compared to self-initiated ones? Do FDA-initiated protocol amendments constitute a significant barrier to drug development compared to other barriers, such as increasing costs associated with patient recruitment, IRB approval delays, etc.? _\[Note: Probe about a recent clinical trial experience for more specifics.\]_
12. Do you feel that there are clinical investigator shortages in the U.S.? Overseas? If so, how significant of a problem is this? Have you undertaken any measures to mitigate this problem for your company? If so, please describe.
13. Are there any recent developments in clinical research that are proving helpful in mitigating barriers to drug development? Please elaborate.
14. Are there actions that the federal government could take to mitigate drug development barriers (e.g., make changes to the clinical data submission requirements to FDA)? If so, what are those actions?
15. Which of these government actions you enumerated above would have the greatest impact/potential to promote more clinical research in the short term? In the long term?

**3 OTHER QUESTIONS (TO ASK IF TIME PERMITS)**

16. What is the typical rate you use for discounting future revenues (i.e., weighted average cost of capital - WACC)?
17. Can you describe/quantify (say on a scale of 1 to 10) how confident you are about your forecasts of future development costs and expected sales volume at the point when you decide to file an IND? \[Note: The answer is relevant to our discounting of future projections in some modeling we are attempting for the industry.\]
18. What types of tools/methods (e.g., real options valuation method) do you use for evaluating/ranking drug development projects? Please describe.
19. Thinking about your recent decisions regarding NMEs, have there been individual factors or uncertainties in planning for clinical trials that have led you to decide not to file an IND for reasonably good candidates? Can you outline the reasons for not proceeding with an IND in the case of one or two recent decisions?
20. Have you pursued regulatory approvals for any NMEs in the EU and not in the US specifically because of FDA clinical trial requirements?
21. To what extent and in what circumstances do you not seek FDA reviews of your clinical trial plans? If there is any uncertainty about FDA’s acceptance of your clinical trial data, are there reasons why you do not seek FDA review before a specific trial? \[Note: Probe about a recent clinical trial experience for more specifics.\]

**4 CLINICAL TRIAL COSTS**

Next, we would like to inquire about the sponsor costs of conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy for an NME. We recognize that these costs may vary significantly based on the therapeutic area and other factors. Thus, “guesstimates” of ranges of hours/dollars/percentages are sufficient.

22. We are interested in costs incurred by the drug sponsor for managing clinical trials. Can you guesstimate how much you spend internally to manage a given clinical trial, for example, as a percentage of the fees paid to a clinical research organization? Can you describe what the major components of the sponsor costs entail (e.g., oversight activities, monitoring, etc.)?
23. What percent of the total cost for a given clinical trial is related to one-time (study-specific) costs?
24. Do you conduct clinical trials outside the U.S? If so, how many countries are typically involved?
25. _(If respondent nd cates “no” to 11, then s p to 12)._ If so, can you generalize about how the total cost of conducting clinical trials outside the U.S. (including all internal and external expenses) compare to that of U.S. based clinical trials for your company?
26. Which components of clinical trial costs are rising most quickly in recent years? Can you offer an assessment as to why clinical trial costs are rising across the board?

| **FDA Application Fee** | The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012, which was signed by the President on July 9, 2012 (PDUFA V), authorizes FDA to collect user fees for certain applications for approval of drug and biological products. This document establishes fee rates for fiscal year (FY) 2013 for application fees for an application requiring clinical data ($1,958,800), for establishment fees ($526,500), and for product fees ($98,380). These fees are effective on October 1, 2012, and will remain in effect through September 30, 2013. For applications submitted on or after October 1, 2012, the new fee schedule must be used. | Drug / product | U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 2012c. |
| **Number of IRB Amendments** | Average number of amendments for a given therapeutic area and phase, as derived from Getz, et al., 2011. In this study, amendments were defined as “any change to a protocol requiring internal approval followed by approval from the IRB, ethical review board (ERB), or regulatory authority. Only implemented amendments—that is, amendments approved both internally and by the ethics committee—were counted and analyzed in this study.” Per-phase amendment counts were calculated by multiplying the average number of amendments by phase (from Table 3 in Getz, et al., 2011) by a therapeutic area-specific factor (calculated using numbers in Table 4 in Getz, et al., 2011). | Study | Getz, et al., 2011; calculation. |
| **Number of IRB Approvals** | Average number of IRB approvals needed for a given study. The default scenario assumes this to be equal to the number of sites in a study | Study | Assumption based on data from Medidata Insights™ (Medidata Solutions) |
| **Number of Patients** | The number of _planned_ patients. This is the number of patients a site is expected and contracted to enroll. | Site | PICAS<sup>®</sup> (Medidata Solutions, 2012b) |

| **Number of Site Management Months** | Number of months a site was managed; the time period from the first site initiation to the last site close-out | Site month | CROCAS<sup>®</sup> (Medidata Solutions, 2012a) |
| **Number of Site Monitoring Days** | The number of actual days spent at a given site (on-site) for monitoring purposes (not the total period over which monitoring was conducted) | Site monitoring day | CROCAS<sup>®</sup> (Medidata Solutions, 2012a) |
| **Number of Sites** | Number of clinical investigator sites used per study/protocol | Study | Medidata Insights<sup>™ </sup> (Medidata Solutions) |
| **Number of Trials in Phase** | The number of trials conducted in a given phase for the drug. Multiple trials within a phase might be required to test different dosages, for example. The default is one trial in each phase. Enter a whole number between 1 and 10 for Phases 1-3 and a whole number between 0 and 3 for Phase 4 (zero signifying that there is no Phase 4 trial). | Whole number | N/A |
| **Site Overhead Percent** | Site overhead charged on contracts by the site estimated at 25 percent of total per-study costs | Percent | PICAS<sup>®</sup> (Medidata Solutions, 2012b) |
| **Patient Recruitment Costs** | Advertising costs associated with recruitment of patients at the per-patient level | Patient | PICAS<sup>®</sup> (Medidata Solutions, 2012b) |
| **Patient Retention Costs** | Amount paid to the patient for study participation, which might include financial compensation, reimbursement for travel, meals, etc | Patient | PICAS<sup>®</sup> (Medidata Solutions, 2012b) |
| **Phase Time** | Total length of study phase, in years. For Phases 1, 2, and 3, this variable is equal to the maximum of the phase lengths from DiMasi, et al. (2003), the Number of Site Management Months from Medidata, and the Number of Project Management Months from Medidata. For Phase 4, this variable is equal to the higher of the Number of Site Management Months and the Number of Project Management Months. From DiMasi, et al. (2003): “The timeline is constructed from information on average phase lengths and the average gaps and overlaps between successive phases in a Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development database of approved new drugs and in our cost survey.” The NDA/BLA review time includes the time from first submission of an NDA/BLA to regulatory marketing approval, and comes from DiMasi, Grabowski, & Vernon (2004). Trial phase times do not reflect differences between therapeutic areas; however, therapeutic areaspecific NDA/BLA review times were available and used for a select list of therapeutic areas. When the user specifies that there are multiple trials within a given phase, total phase time is defined as the average of the maximum phase time entered in any of the trials and the sum of all phase times entered in all of the trials. This is intended to account for the fact that trials may either be concurrent or sequential, depending on the circumstances. | Years | DiMasi, et al., 2003; DiMasi, Grabowski, & Vernon, 2004; CROCAS<sup>®</sup> (Medidata Solutions, 2012a) |

| **Site Recruitment Costs** | Cost for CRO to evaluate and recruit one site (which may or may not involve a site visit) | Site | CROCAS<sup>®</sup> (Medidata Solutions, 2012a) |
| **Site Retention Costs** | Cost for CRO to manage one site for one month | Month | CROCAS<sup>®</sup> (Medidata Solutions, 2012a) |
| **Success Probability** | The percent chance that a trial will be successful in a given phase and progress to the next phase (or, in the case of the NDA/BLA review phase, the percent chance that the drug will be granted approval). The BioMedTracker success probabilities used represent ERG's best guess for most relevant therapeutic area; if figures were not available for a similar therapeutic area, general/overall percentages were used. Custom success probabilities may be entered as decimals between 0 and 1 with leading zero (e.g., 0.80). Only one success probability value may be specified for the entire set of trials within a given phase. | Percent per phase | Hay et al., 2011. |
| **Worldwide Sales Revenues (millions of 2008 dollars)** | Worldwide sales revenues (in millions of dollars) over the product life cycle for new drugs approved in the United States during the period from 1990 to 1994 (net present values, discounted at 11% to the launch year). The revenue figures have been inflated from 2000 dollars to 2008 dollars (midpoint between 2004 and 2012, the range covered by the itemized cost data) using the producer price index for commodities in the category “Drugs and pharmaceuticals” from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). | Drug / product (millions of 2008 dollars) | DiMasi, Grabowski, & Vernon, 2004; Consumer Price Index (CPI) Inflation Calculator. (2012). |

\[a\] Phase 1 study sites tend to have in-house or local labs as opposed to central labs.

## Appendix C: Features of Operational Model

Upon launching the operational model in Microsoft Excel, the user is automatically taken to the first page of the user form, which prompts the user to indicate whether he intends to examine the impacts of mitigating barriers to clinical trials, or go directly to the examination of clinical trial costs (see Figure C - 1). If “Barrier Impacts” is selected, the user is taken to a screen where different types of barrier mitigation strategies may be selected (see Figure C - 2and Section 5 for further detail). If the user selects “Costs,” the user is then taken to a page that provides a set of instructions and prompts the user to specify the type of clinical trial he would like to model (see Figure C - 3). The clinical trial options built into the model based on data availability include: Therapeutic Area, Devices and Diagnostics, and Pharmacokinetics. If the user selects the “Therapeutic Area” option, a specific therapeutic area must then be chosen from among the following in a separate drop-down menu: Anti-Infective, Cardiovascular, Central Nervous System, Dermatology, Endocrine, Gastrointestinal, Genitourinary System, Hematology, Immunomodulation, Oncology, Ophthalmology, Pain and Anesthesia, and Respiratory System. Once these selections have been made, the user may click on a “Next” button to proceed to the next page of the user form.

**Figure C - 1: Welcome Screen of the Clinical Trials Model**

![Figure C - 2: Impact of Removal of Barriers Screen](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/images-reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-and-barriers-drug-development/Figure%2010.png)

**Figure C - 3: Selection of Type of Trial Screen for Examination of Costs**

**![Figure C - 3: Selection of Type of Trial Screen for Examination of Costs](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/images-reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-and-barriers-drug-development/Figure%2011.png)**

On the succeeding page of the user form (see Figure C - 4), the user then needs to enter some general information about the trial, including the discount rate to be used as well as the probability of success in Phases 1 through 3 and the NDA/BLA review phase. The user may choose to leave these fields blank or specify that the default values be used, in which case these fields are populated with the values from the interviews and literature, as described below. Also on this page are spaces for the user to select the number of trials within each phase. Due to the need to test different dosages or alter other aspects of a trial, multiple trials within a given phase are common or even required in many cases. Therefore, the user must specify how many trials they would like to have in each phase, with possibilities ranging from one to ten for Phases 1 through 3 and zero to three for Phase 4 (if there is no Phase 4, the user needs to enter zero for the number of Phase 4 trials). The ranges for the number of trials for each phase were decided upon based on discussions with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (we asked FDA for an estimate of the number of trials used to support efficacy for NME NDAs and were provided with a range of roughly one to nine trials for Phases 2 and 3). These fields may not be left blank, as the responses will determine how many cost input forms the user will be asked to fill in and how many trial costs are factored into the total phase cost calculations for both the default and custom scenarios.

**Figure C - 4: General Questions Screen**

**![Figure C - 4: General Questions Screen](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/images-reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-and-barriers-drug-development/Figure%2012.png)**

Once this general data are entered, the user may then proceed to the following pages, which request various parameter values for each trial and phase (see Figure C - 5). Within each phase, each trial has its own user input page, and the number of user input pages is equal to the number of trials specified by the user in the previous step. For example, if the user indicates that there would be two Phase 1 trials, the user would see two pages of data to enter for Phase 1. Each of these trial-specific pages asks for information on trial length, number of patients per site, number of sites, and itemized costs, allowing the user to customize values for each trial individually. As on the general tab, the user may choose to populate fields with the default values/averages or enter custom values.

**Figure C - 5: Parameter Value Entry for Clinical Trial Study per Trial Phase Screen**

**![Figure C - 5: Parameter Value Entry for Clinical Trial Study per Trial Phase Screen](https://aspe.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/private/images-reports/examination-clinical-trial-costs-and-barriers-drug-development/Figure%2013.png)**

For convenience and ease of use, we have added various user-friendly features to the model interface. For example, if the user is uncertain about the meaning of a particular parameter or wants to understand more fully what it includes, he can hover over the name of the parameter with the cursor to see a brief definition and any important instructions for how to enter a custom value for that parameter. For more information, users can refer to a “Parameter Definitions” page that contains more detailed definitions, as well as information on sources and units. Error-checking is another key feature designed to improve the functionality of the tool. If the user enters a number that is inappropriate for a given parameter (e.g., a negative number), an error message will appear alerting the user to change the custom value entered. Some of these rules are strict and will not permit the user to continue to the next page without entering a valid value. For example, the user cannot enter a trial success probability greater than 1 (100%) or a negative number of patients. Other rules simply provide warnings to the user that the value entered might warrant additional consideration. For example, using the variances from Medidata, we calculated reasonable ranges of possible values that fall within three standard deviations of the default mean. If the user enters a number beyond these ranges (e.g., 20,000 patients per site), a warning message appears. However, given the possibility that users may wish to test the effects of outlier or extreme values, the model permits them to disregard this warning and proceed. Figure C - 6 shows the results screen of the clinical trials model developed.

## Appendix D: Additional Data Cleaning Steps

We performed the final cleaning and compilation of the various clinical trial data elements using the statistical software STATA. For some combinations of cost component, phase, and therapeutic area, Medidata did not have enough underlying trial data to provide means and variances while still maintaining confidentiality of client information. Because these missing values resulting from these data gaps would render the model’s total cost calculations incomplete, we worked closely with Medidata to extrapolate them as accurately as possible. For the outsourcing and clinical costs that were missing, Medidata multiplied overall U.S. means by phase and therapeutic-area specific factors to create tables of derived costs that could be used to fill in data for phase-therapeutic area combinations for which those measures were missing. Similarly, missing variances were filled in using the overall U.S. variances from the same pool of data used to derive the means. For the counts/non-cost data elements _(Number of Site Management Months; Number of Project Management Months, and Number of Site Monitoring Days)_, Medidata used phase-specific factors to create tables of derived values. However, due to data limitations, these could not be broken down further by therapeutic area. Thus, we used the derived means and variances for these fields to fill in missing values across all therapeutic areas. Missing values in the _Number of Planned Patients (per site) and Number of Sites (per study)_ fields were extrapolated using phase-specific averages across all other therapeutic areas. Finally, _Number of SDV Fields (per study)_ could not be derived by phase or therapeutic area; therefore, in all cases where this measure was blank, it was estimated with the overall U.S. number for all phases and all therapeutic areas.

In addition to filling in missing values for the fields from Medidata, we also had to find data to populate other fields that were missing altogether. Medidata collects data on cost per IRB approvals and cost per IRB amendments which was provided to ERG; however, they do not collect data at this time on the number of IRB approvals or IRB amendments for each study. Therefore they did not have counts by which to multiply the IRB-related costs. To generate counts of IRB approvals, we assumed that one approval would be needed for each site in the study, and created a field called _Number of IRB Approvals (per study)_, which was set to equal the _Number of Sites (per study)_ field provided by Medidata. To obtain counts of IRB amendments, we turned to the literature on clinical trial costs and found counts of protocol amendments in a 2011 study by Kenneth Getz and other researchers at Tufts CSDD (described in Section 4).<sup>17</sup> The study reported average numbers of amendments by therapeutic area, and separately by phase (across all therapeutic areas). Thus, we were able to use a similar method to that described above for extrapolating missing values to derive amendment counts by phase and therapeutic area; therapeutic areaspecific factors were calculated and then multiplied by the phase-specific amendment counts, allowing us to fully populate a new field called “ _umber of IRB Amendments (per study)._” For therapeutic areas for which there was no counterpart in Getz, et al. (2011), we used the counts for the “Other” category.

An additional cleaning step was necessary to reconcile some minor discrepancies between the data obtained from the literature and the data received from Medidata. Specifically, the mean trial phase lengths from DiMasi, Hansen, & Grabowski (2003) were, for a few therapeutic area-phase combinations, slightly shorter than the number of site management months or the number of project management months (defined below) provided by Medidata. To resolve these discrepancies, we set the trial phase length equal to the maximum of these three variables: the mean phase lengths from DiMasi, Hansen, & Grabowski (2003), the number of site management months (from Medidata), and the number of project management months (from Medidata).
