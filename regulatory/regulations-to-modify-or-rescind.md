    *   *Area for Review:* Slow/ill-suited pre-market review for internal platform tools (AI/ML); uncertainty about regulating algorithm updates.
    *   *Potential Modifications:* Develop lighter-touch regulatory pathway via guidance for integral SaMD components. Emphasize transparency, post-market surveillance via platform data, and real-world performance. Repeal requirements for extensive pre-market validation for established algorithms within this controlled environment. **Establish a clear, risk-based framework (via guidance) for managing, validating, and clearing changes/updates to algorithms** within a certified platform, repealing applicability of overly rigid change control regulations designed for static software.

*   **Streamline/Integrate EAP via dFDA Participation (21 CFR Part 312, Subpart I / Right to Try Act Interpretation):**
    *   *Area for Review:* Separate administrative hurdles for EAP/compassionate use; synergy with Right to Try.
    *   *Potential Modifications:* Modify EAP regulations/guidance to **formally recognize dFDA trial participation as fulfilling EAP requirements** for eligible patients. Interpret regulations to automatically grant access via the platform if Right to Try criteria are met and the drug is available in a dFDA trial, repealing the need for separate FDA review in such cases.

*   **Reduce Reliance on Mandatory Advisory Committees (FDA AdComm Guidance / Procedures):**
    *   *Area for Review:* Time/cost burdens of formal committee meetings.
    *   *Potential Modifications:* Modify guidance/procedures to reduce instances requiring AdComm review for dFDA-based applications. Leverage platform transparency, asynchronous expert input. Repeal automatic triggers for AdComm review based solely on criteria rendered less relevant by platform data availability.

*   **Enable Dynamic Digital Labeling (Updating 21 CFR Part 201 Interpretation/Guidance):**
    *   *Area for Review:* Static labels slow to update with emerging info.
    *   *Potential Modifications:* Permit/encourage FDA-approved digital labeling systems (linked to dFDA) via guidance. Allow rapid updates (AEs, RWE) supplementing a core label. Repeal interpretations strictly requiring all label info to be static or hindering rapid updates based on platform data.

*   **Leverage dFDA for Record Retention Requirements (ICH E6 / 21 CFR Part 11 / GMP Regs Guidance):**
    *   *Area for Review:* Costly/duplicative maintenance of separate long-term archives.
    *   *Potential Modifications:* Issue guidance clarifying that validated dFDA platform's immutable electronic records fulfill primary retention requirements. Repeal guidance interpretations requiring separate, redundant sponsor-maintained archives for data captured reliably by the platform.

*   **Cybersecurity Incident Response & Safe Harbors for Platforms (Modification of FDA Cybersecurity Guidance, HIPAA Security Rule 45 CFR 164 Subpart C):**
    *   *Area for Review:* Clarity needed on handling breaches in large-scale platforms; incentives for robust security.
    *   *Potential Modifications:* **Issue guidance clarifying cybersecurity incident reporting requirements specifically for certified dFDA platforms.** Potentially offer **safe harbors from certain penalties** if predefined, certified best-practice security protocols were implemented and followed, encouraging robust security adoption. Define clear protocols for breach notification/response in a decentralized context.

*   **Recognize Patient Data Ownership & Facilitate Third-Party Ratings (HIPAA 45 CFR Parts 160, 164 Guidance):**
    *   *Area for Review:* Lack of explicit patient data ownership; barriers to market-based rating systems; restrictions on secondary use.
    *   *Potential Modifications:* Issue guidance interpreting HIPAA to maximize patient control, portability, and **explicitly recognizing individual ownership of raw health data**. Explicitly state regulations **do not prohibit** and should **facilitate** architectures enabling granular patient permissions (including for **broad secondary research via opt-out models**) and the creation of third-party rating systems using anonymized/aggregated dFDA data. Repeal interpretations hindering data flow for these purposes.
