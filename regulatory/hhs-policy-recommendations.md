This proposal recommends that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) sponsor an **FDA-X Prize** to incentivize the creation of an **open-source, decentralized FDA (dFDA)** platform. This platform would enable **perpetual, patient-driven clinical trials** accessible to anyone globally, eliminating inefficiencies in the current phased trial system. The proposal outlines strategies for **redirecting NIH research funding**, **leveraging existing HHS authorities**, and **adopting outcome-based funding models** to maximize trial participation without requiring new legislation. Additionally, it proposes the **strategic reallocation of portions of Medicare and Medicaid funding** under existing statutory provisions to support broader access to decentralized trials.

A critical component of this proposal is to **clarify the potential for drug companies to set a per-participant price** when creating trials on the dFDA platform. Under existing **FDA regulations ([21 CFR 312.8](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-312/section-312.8))**, companies may charge for investigational drugs to recover direct costs, including employee salaries. This means that **drug companies could legally charge the NIH a per-participant price** covering all operational expenses—such as manufacturing, distribution, and employee compensation—**without requiring pre-approval**, provided they do not exceed cost-recovery limits. This structure would enable companies to sustain clinical trial operations while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards, promoting a scalable and sustainable ecosystem for perpetual trials.

Moreover, **existing Medicare and Medicaid policies** already permit reimbursement for routine patient costs in qualifying clinical trials. By aligning the dFDA platform's operational structure with these statutory frameworks, **drug companies could expand access to experimental treatments**, leveraging government funding mechanisms to cover essential costs. This approach ensures that trial sponsors can sustainably conduct large-scale studies while maintaining affordability and regulatory compliance.

# HHS Budget Context and Reallocation Potential

- **Total HHS Budget (FY 2025):** $1.843 trillion ([HHS Budget Overview](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/fy-2025-budget-in-brief.pdf)).  
  - **Medicare and Medicaid:** Constitute **85%** of total outlays ([FAS Report](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R48060.pdf)).  
  - **HRSA:** Allocated $16.3 billion (\~0.9% of total budget) ([HRSA Budget Justification](https://www.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/hrsa/about/budget/budget-justification-fy2025.pdf)).

Given the size of the Medicare and Medicaid budgets and existing statutory permissions, **redirecting even a fraction of these funds to dFDA trials could enable participation for tens of millions of patients** without legislative changes. Furthermore, **NIH reimbursements to drug companies for cost-recovery-based per-participant pricing** would align with **FDA regulations**, ensuring compliance and operational sustainability.

# Potential Participant Capacity with Proposed Funding

Given the **$30.6 billion** annual allocation for perpetual and adaptive trial execution and referencing the **Oxford RECOVERY Trial's per-patient cost of \~$500** ([RECOVERY Trial Cost](https://sph.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Meeting-Summary-RECOVERY-Trial.pdf)), the proposed funding could support:

- **Over 61 million participants annually** (**$30.6B ÷ $500 per participant**).

**Medicare/Medicaid Integration Potential:**

- Existing policies allow for Medicare and Medicaid funds to cover routine patient costs in clinical trials. **Expanding this coverage to dFDA trials could support an additional 100+ million participants annually**, given the combined scale of these programs.  
- **Per-participant pricing by trial sponsors**, structured for cost recovery and compliant with [**21 CFR 312.8**](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-D/part-312/subpart-A/section-312.8), could further enhance trial scalability without the need for pre-approval.

### **1. Why Previous Initiatives Failed**

#### **a. Sentinel Initiative: Limited Transparency and Bureaucratic Constraints**

- **Closed Data Silos:** Although Sentinel enabled active surveillance for post-market drug safety, it remained closed-source, restricting broader stakeholder engagement, innovation, and iterative improvement. Researchers and developers outside the FDA could not access core tools or data pipelines to enhance or repurpose them for broader clinical trial applications.
- **Bureaucratic Oversight:** The complexity of working within federal regulatory frameworks slowed integration with emerging technologies and adaptive trial methodologies. Regulatory inertia prevented agile experimentation with decentralized trial models.
- **Lack of Real-Time Adaptability:** Sentinel was primarily designed for post-market surveillance, not real-time adaptive trials, thus failing to impact early-stage drug development timelines.

#### **b. All of Us Program: Centralized Control, Fragmented Incentives**

- **Slow Data Utilization:** While ambitious in its goal to collect data from a million diverse participants, All of Us remained hindered by centralization, leading to slow data curation, analysis, and deployment in real-world research.
- **Limited Access for Decentralized Innovation:** The closed infrastructure prevented decentralized teams from rapidly deploying new analysis tools or integrating with clinical trial ecosystems.
- **Overly Academic Focus:** The program primarily served academic research agendas rather than creating direct pipelines for real-time patient participation in clinical trials, missing the opportunity for immediate translational research impact.

#### **c. Cure-ID: Insufficient Incentives and Network Effects**

- **Lack of Engagement:** Cure-ID, designed for healthcare professionals to share treatment outcomes, struggled with user engagement due to a lack of financial and reputational incentives.
- **No Robust Reward Mechanisms:** Without mechanisms like token-based rewards or direct research funding incentives, participation remained minimal.
- **Non-Scalable Architecture:** Its limited interoperability with decentralized health data networks reduced its capacity to scale alongside personalized and precision medicine initiatives.

### **2. How an Open-Source, X Prize Model Can Succeed Where Others Failed**

#### **a. Open-Source Infrastructure: Transparency, Flexibility, and Global Collaboration**

- **Unrestricted Access:** Open-source architectures allow researchers, biotech startups, and patient communities worldwide to contribute to and improve core trial platforms.
- **Interoperability:** Seamless integration with digital health records, wearables, and real-world data streams can drive perpetual, adaptive trials at a scale impossible under closed systems.
- **Reduced Duplication:** Open codebases prevent redundant efforts, accelerating the iteration of improved trial designs and AI-driven analysis tools.

#### **b. X Prize Model: Incentivizing Breakthrough Innovation**

- **Outcome-Driven Rewards:** Unlike bureaucratic grants that fund effort rather than results, X Prizes reward successful outcomes—spurring ambitious, results-oriented innovation.
- **Attracting Diverse Talent:** A substantial prize pool attracts interdisciplinary teams, fostering cross-sector solutions involving AI, blockchain, genomics, and data science.
- **De-Risking Radical Ideas:** The prize model encourages moonshot thinking that traditional funding mechanisms avoid, accelerating paradigm-shifting breakthroughs in clinical trial methodologies.

#### **c. Technological Advancements: AI, Blockchain, and Edge Computing**

- **AI for Adaptive Trials:** Machine learning models can personalize patient pathways, optimize trial endpoints, and monitor safety in real-time, radically shortening timelines from discovery to deployment.
- **Blockchain for Trust and Transparency:** Immutable records of trial data, drug provenance, and patient consent build trust and eliminate fraud risks, ensuring regulatory compliance without manual oversight.
