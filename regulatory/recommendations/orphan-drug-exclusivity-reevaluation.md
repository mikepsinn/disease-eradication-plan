# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### Last Name

### Email

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Orphan Drug Designation & Exclusivity (Implementing Regulation 21 CFR Part 316)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 316

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

This regulation implements provisions of the Orphan Drug Act. It defines criteria for designating a drug or biologic for a rare disease or condition and outlines the incentives provided, most notably a period of market exclusivity (typically 7 years) upon approval for the designated orphan indication. The goal is to incentivize the development of products for rare diseases that might otherwise lack sufficient commercial potential.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While successfully incentivizing development for many rare diseases, the fixed exclusivity period can have downsides, particularly when development costs are dramatically reduced by platforms like dFDA:

* **Government-Granted Monopoly:** Provides a lengthy period of market protection that can limit competition, hinder follow-on innovation by others for the same indication, and keep prices high.
* **Potential Misalignment with dFDA:** If the dFDA platform significantly reduces the cost, risk, and time required to develop drugs for rare diseases, the rationale for a long, fixed exclusivity period weakens.
* **Discourages Data Sharing:** Exclusivity can disincentivize continued data sharing or participation in platform trials after approval.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No, as the core incentive structure is statutory (Orphan Drug Act). However, the *implementing regulations and FDA's interpretation* (21 CFR 316) could potentially be modified to adapt the *application* of these incentives in the dFDA context, pushing the boundaries of existing flexibility.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, modify implementing regulations and guidance to the extent possible under current law:

* **Contingent Exclusivity:** Modify 21 CFR 316 or issue guidance interpreting it such that, for orphan drugs developed primarily using a certified dFDA platform, the *continuation* of the full market exclusivity period is made **contingent upon ongoing data sharing and trial participation via the dFDA platform.** This links the incentive to continued evidence generation.
* **Administrative Interpretation:** Explore administrative interpretations of the Orphan Drug Act and 21 CFR 316 that might allow for considerations of development efficiency (e.g., via dFDA) when evaluating the scope or application of exclusivity, although this is legally constrained.
* **(Legislative Recommendation):** While not a regulatory modification, strongly advocate for legislative changes to the Orphan Drug Act itself to allow for tiered or dynamic exclusivity periods based on factors like development cost/speed facilitated by platforms like dFDA.
