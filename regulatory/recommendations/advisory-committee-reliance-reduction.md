# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Advisory Committee Procedures & Guidance (e.g., 21 CFR Part 14 - Public Advisory Committees; FDA Guidance on Advisory Committee Meetings)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 14; Various FDA Guidance Documents and procedures related to Advisory Committees (AdComms).

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations and guidances govern the establishment, function, and procedures of FDA's public advisory committees. AdComms provide independent expert advice and recommendations to the Agency on scientific, technical, and policy matters related to the development and evaluation of regulated products, aiming to enhance the quality of FDA's decision-making and ensure public transparency.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both.

While valuable for complex issues, the mandatory use and formal structure of AdComm meetings can create burdens and may be less necessary when high-quality, transparent data is available via platforms:
*   **Time/Cost Burdens:** Preparing for and conducting formal AdComm meetings requires significant time and resources from both FDA staff and sponsors.
*   **Potential Delays:** Scheduling and holding AdComm meetings adds time to the review process.
*   **Redundancy with Platform Transparency:** For applications based primarily on robust, transparent data from a certified dFDA platform, the need for a formal public committee meeting to debate the evidence may be reduced, as experts and the public could potentially access and analyze much of the data more directly.
*   **Automatic Triggers:** Certain automatic triggers for requiring AdComm review might be less relevant if platform data provides sufficient clarity on safety and effectiveness.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Advisory committees provide valuable independent expertise, especially for novel or complex situations. However, the *mandatory* reliance on them for certain review types should be reduced when alternative mechanisms provide sufficient expert input and transparency.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, FDA guidance and procedures regarding AdComm use should be modified:
*   **Reduce Mandatory AdComm Use:** Modify guidance/procedures to **reduce the instances where AdComm review is automatically required** for marketing applications based primarily on robust data from certified dFDA platforms.
*   **Leverage Platform Transparency/Input:** Explore mechanisms via guidance for leveraging the dFDA platform's transparency to facilitate **broader, potentially asynchronous expert input or targeted consultations** as an alternative to a full, formal committee meeting for certain applications.
*   **Reserve for Novelty/Complexity:** Reserve mandatory, formal committee reviews primarily for truly novel mechanisms of action, complex safety signals requiring broad deliberation, significant public health impact decisions, or situations where platform data is insufficient or requires significant expert interpretation.
*   **Repeal Automatic Triggers:** Repeal automatic triggers for AdComm review (based on specific application types or criteria) where those criteria are rendered less relevant by the availability and transparency of comprehensive dFDA platform data.
