# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Post-Approval Manufacturing Changes Reporting (e.g., 21 CFR 314.70 - Supplements for drugs, 21 CFR 601.12 - Changes to biologics license, 21 CFR 814.39 - PMA supplements; related GMP/Comparability Guidance)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Examples: 21 CFR 314.70, 21 CFR 601.12, 21 CFR 814.39; Various FDA guidances on post-approval changes (PACs), comparability protocols, scale-up (SUPAC).

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations and guidances establish the requirements for reporting changes to the manufacturing process, facilities, specifications, or controls for an approved medical product. They categorize changes based on their potential impact on product quality, safety, or effectiveness (e.g., major changes requiring prior FDA approval via supplements, moderate changes reportable in 30 days or via CBE-0, minor changes reportable in annual reports). The goal is to ensure that changes do not adversely affect the approved product.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both.

While necessary for maintaining quality, the current framework for managing post-approval changes can be:
*   **Burdensome:** Preparing and submitting supplements, especially prior approval supplements (PAS), for manufacturing changes can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
*   **Slows Improvement/Efficiency:** The burden can discourage or delay manufacturers from implementing potentially beneficial process improvements, efficiency enhancements, or scale-up activities.
*   **Underutilizes Real-Time Data:** The current system relies heavily on predictive assessments of change impact rather than potentially leveraging real-time manufacturing process data and continuous post-market outcomes data available from platforms like dFDA to monitor the actual impact of changes.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Oversight of post-approval manufacturing changes is important for quality assurance. However, the reporting categories and reliance on prior approval for certain changes could be modified based on data available from integrated platforms.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations and guidance should be modified to leverage platform data:
*   **Leverage Platform Data for Justification:** Modify regulations/guidance to explicitly allow **real-time manufacturing process data (e.g., from PAT systems integrated with the platform) and continuous post-market outcomes data (safety, effectiveness) from a certified dFDA platform to be used to support the justification and risk classification** of certain post-approval manufacturing changes.
*   **Downgrade Reporting Categories:** Allow robust platform data demonstrating lack of adverse impact to support downgrading the reporting category for certain changes (e.g., moving some changes currently requiring PAS to CBE-0 or Annual Report status).
*   **Repeal Prior Approval Where Data Suffices:** Repeal the requirement for prior approval supplements (PAS) for specific types of changes where continuous platform data (both manufacturing and outcomes) provides adequate real-time assurance that the change has not negatively impacted product quality, safety, or effectiveness.
*   **Facilitate Continuous Improvement:** Create pathways via guidance that use platform data to facilitate more rapid implementation of manufacturing process improvements and efficiency gains.
