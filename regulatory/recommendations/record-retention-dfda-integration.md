# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Record Retention Requirements (Various regulations & guidances, e.g., ICH E6, 21 CFR Part 11, 21 CFR Parts 211, 820, 312, 314)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

References multiple parts of 21 CFR (e.g., Part 11, 211, 312, 314, 820) and ICH Guidances (e.g., E6(R2)).

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations and guidelines establish minimum requirements for the retention of records related to clinical trials, manufacturing, and post-market activities. The purpose is to ensure data integrity, allow for verification of results, facilitate inspections, and enable reconstruction of events if necessary for safety or compliance reviews.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both.

These requirements lead to significant long-term storage burdens and potential redundancy when data resides securely within a certified dFDA platform:
*   **Physical/Digital Storage Burden:** Maintaining extensive records, sometimes for decades, requires significant physical or digital storage infrastructure and associated costs.
*   **Redundancy with Platform:** If a certified dFDA platform securely stores, audits, and maintains the primary source data and associated metadata with robust access controls and audit trails, separate, duplicative retention by sponsors, sites, or manufacturers may be unnecessary for platform-generated data.
*   **Complexity:** Varying retention periods across different regulations (e.g., GCP, GMP, specific product types) adds complexity to compliance.
*   **Accessibility:** Accessing archived records, particularly older or physical ones, can be cumbersome and slow.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. The principle of maintaining records for verification and inspection is essential. However, the *method* and *location* of retention should be modernized.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations and guidance should be modified to recognize certified dFDA platforms as a primary means of meeting record retention requirements:
*   **Recognize Platform as Primary Repository:** Modify relevant regulations (e.g., 21 CFR Part 11, GCP, GMP) and associated guidance to explicitly state that data generated and maintained within a certified dFDA platform, meeting defined security, audit trail, and long-term archiving standards, **fulfills the record retention requirements** for that data.
*   **Streamline Retention Periods:** Where feasible, harmonize or simplify retention periods for data stored on the platform, potentially linking them to the platform's operational lifecycle or data integrity guarantees.
*   **Focus on Platform Certification:** Shift the focus of compliance from individual entity storage to the **certification and ongoing validation of the dFDA platform's** record management and archival capabilities.
*   **Repeal Duplicative Requirements:** Repeal specific clauses in existing regulations or guidance that mandate separate, sponsor/site/manufacturer-held copies of records *if* those records are demonstrably secure, accessible, and verifiable within a certified dFDA platform for the required duration.
