# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Drug Labeling Requirements (21 CFR Part 201 & related guidance)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 201; Various FDA Guidances on Drug Labeling (e.g., Physician Labeling Rule, Content and Format)

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations govern the content and format of prescription and over-the-counter drug labeling. The primary goal is to provide healthcare professionals and patients with adequate information for the safe and effective use of the drug, including indications, contraindications, warnings, precautions, adverse reactions, and dosage instructions, based on the evidence reviewed by FDA.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While providing essential information, the current labeling paradigm has significant limitations, especially when contrasted with dynamic data platforms:

* **Static Content:** Requires labeling content to be fixed based on data available at the time of approval, making it slow and burdensome to update with important emerging safety or effectiveness information (including RWE).
* **Format Rigidity:** Prescribes specific formats (e.g., the Physician Labeling Rule format) that can be lengthy and difficult for users to quickly find needed information.
* **Incompatibility with Dynamic Data:** Fundamentally conflicts with the dFDA concept of continuous evidence generation, ranking, and presentation of probabilistic outcomes, as labeling is tied to discrete approval points and static claims.
* **Delayed Updates:** The process for updating labels (e.g., via CBE-0 or prior approval supplements) can be slow, meaning labels may not reflect the most current knowledge.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No, the need for reliable, accessible information on drug use is paramount. However, the regulations and interpretations mandating *static*, periodically updated labels should be repealed or significantly adapted for products evaluated on dynamic platforms.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations and guidance should be modified to enable dynamic, digital labeling:

* **Enable Dynamic Digital Labeling:** Modify 21 CFR Part 201 or issue overriding guidance to explicitly permit and encourage the use of FDA-approved dynamic digital labeling systems, potentially linked to or integrated with the dFDA platform, for drugs evaluated on the platform.
* **Core vs. Dynamic Content:** Allow for a stable "core" label (e.g., basic pharmacology, critical warnings) supplemented by dynamic sections (e.g., adverse event frequencies, efficacy comparisons, emerging RWE) that can be updated more rapidly based on continuous platform data flow.
* **Repeal Static Requirement:** Repeal interpretations of Part 201 that strictly require all label information to be static or that hinder rapid, evidence-based updates facilitated by a certified platform.
* **Alternative Pathways:** Create exemptions or alternative regulatory pathways allowing platform-generated dynamic outcome labels (meeting defined standards) to supplement or replace traditional labeling sections.
* **Standards for Dynamic Labels:** Establish clear standards via guidance for the content, format, validation, user interface, and updating frequency/process for dynamic digital labels to ensure clarity, usability, and prevention of misinterpretation.
