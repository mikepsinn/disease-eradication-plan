### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA) Implementation Guidance

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA Guidance Documents related to the implementation of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA).

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

Guidance related to DSCSA aims to help stakeholders (manufacturers, distributors, dispensers) comply with the statutory requirements for product tracing, verification, and serialization to create an interoperable, electronic system to identify and trace prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. The goal is to protect consumers from counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful drugs.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both.

While crucial for supply chain security, the application of DSCSA requirements, particularly track-and-trace, to decentralized clinical trial (DCT) models involving direct-to-patient (DTP) shipment needs clarification:
*   **Uncertainty for DTP Models:** There may be uncertainty or lack of specific guidance on how DSCSA track-and-trace requirements (e.g., transaction information, history, statements) apply to investigational drugs shipped directly from a central depot or pharmacy to a patient's home, bypassing traditional distribution points.
*   **Logistical Complexity:** Applying traditional supply chain tracking models to numerous individual DTP shipments can be logistically complex.
*   **Platform Integration:** Guidance may not yet address how validated tracking systems integrated within a certified dFDA platform could be used to meet DSCSA requirements for trial supplies.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Ensuring the security of the investigational drug supply chain is important. Specific guidance is needed for the DCT/DTP context.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, specific FDA guidance on DSCSA implementation should be issued or modified:
*   **Issue Clear DTP/DCT Guidance:** Provide clear guidance explicitly addressing how DSCSA requirements (serialization, verification, tracing) apply to investigational drugs used in DCTs, particularly those utilizing direct-to-patient shipping models.
*   **Recognize Platform Tracking:** Issue guidance potentially recognizing validated, secure tracking and chain-of-custody systems integrated within a certified dFDA platform as a compliant method for meeting DSCSA requirements for investigational products distributed within platform trials.
*   **Streamline Requirements:** Where appropriate, streamline specific DSCSA documentation or transaction requirements for the unique context of DTP shipments within controlled clinical trials conducted on a certified platform.
*   **Repeal Contradictory Interpretations:** Repeal any existing guidance interpretations that hinder the use of validated, platform-based tracking systems for ensuring supply chain security in compliant DCT/DTP logistics.
