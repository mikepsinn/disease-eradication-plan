### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) (21 CFR Part 208)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 208

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

REMS regulations require manufacturers to implement specific risk management plans beyond standard labeling for certain drugs or biologics with serious safety concerns. The goal is to ensure the benefits of using these products outweigh their risks. REMS can include elements like Medication Guides, communication plans, Elements To Assure Safe Use (ETASU) such as restricted distribution, patient monitoring, or prescriber/pharmacy certification.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both.

While intended to manage known serious risks, REMS programs often impose significant burdens and may be redundant with modern platform capabilities:
*   **Significant Burdens:** REMS, especially those with ETASU, impose substantial administrative, logistical, and cost burdens on manufacturers, healthcare providers, pharmacies, and patients.
*   **Access Barriers:** Restricted distribution or complex monitoring/enrollment requirements can create significant barriers to patient access.
*   **Potential Redundancy:** For products evaluated and monitored on a certified dFDA platform, the platform's inherent capabilities for robust real-time safety monitoring, tracking usage, capturing adverse events, managing patient/provider education, and potentially controlling access could achieve the same safety goals as many REMS elements, but with far less friction and burden.
*   **Data Silos:** REMS often involve separate data collection systems (e.g., patient registries), creating data silos rather than leveraging integrated platform data.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

The requirement to implement a separate REMS program should be repealed for products where a certified dFDA platform can demonstrably achieve the necessary safety assurance goals. The underlying need to manage specific risks remains, but the *mechanism* should leverage the platform.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, the regulation should be modified or specific guidance issued:
*   **Allow Platform as REMS Fulfillment:** Modify 21 CFR Part 208 or issue guidance to explicitly allow the validated capabilities of a certified dFDA platform (e.g., real-time safety monitoring, access controls, integrated patient/provider education, usage tracking) to **satisfy the requirements of, and serve as a less burdensome substitute for, most mandated REMS programs.**
*   **Repeal Separate REMS Requirement:** Repeal the requirement for sponsors to develop and implement a separate REMS program (including ETASU) for products evaluated on a certified dFDA platform, provided the platform demonstrably incorporates features sufficient to manage the specific risks of concern.
*   **Risk-Based Approach:** Focus any residual risk mitigation requirements on only those elements that cannot be adequately addressed through the certified platform's inherent monitoring and control features.
