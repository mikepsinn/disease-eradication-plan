### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

21 CFR Part 202 - Prescription Drug Advertising (and related guidances on promotion/scientific exchange)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 202; Various FDA Guidance Documents on Promotion and Scientific Exchange

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations and guidances are intended to ensure that prescription drug advertising and promotion are truthful, balanced, and not misleading. They set standards for the content and format of promotional materials, including requirements for presenting risk information fairly, ensuring claims are substantiated by evidence, and distinguishing promotional communications from non-promotional scientific exchange.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both.

While aiming to prevent misleading promotion, these rules often severely restrict the communication of truthful information and are ill-suited for dynamic data environments:
*   **Restrictions on Pre-Approval Info:** Limits communication about investigational drugs, even truthful information about ongoing trials conducted via platforms like dFDA.
*   **Off-Label Restrictions:** Severely restricts manufacturers from sharing truthful, non-misleading scientific information about unapproved (off-label) uses of approved drugs, even when supported by emerging evidence (e.g., from RWE generated via dFDA).
*   **Static Information Focus:** Rules are designed around static, pre-approved labeling claims, making it difficult to communicate findings based on dynamic, continuously updated evidence rankings generated by platforms.
*   **Prior Restraint on Speech:** The requirement for claims to align strictly with pre-approved labeling, and limitations on disseminating truthful scientific exchange, can be viewed as government prior restraint on constitutionally protected speech.
*   **Hinders Awareness:** Limits patient and provider awareness of potential treatment options available through trials or supported by emerging real-world evidence.
*   **DTC Trial Advertising Limits:** Interpretations often restrict direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising specifically about clinical trial recruitment.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

Significant portions related to restricting truthful, non-misleading communication should be repealed. The focus should shift from government pre-clearance and content restriction to ensuring transparency and applying general anti-fraud laws to genuinely misleading statements. The core requirement for risk information balance might be retained but adapted.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, repeal restrictive elements and modify the overall approach:
*   **Repeal Restrictions on Truthful Communication:** Repeal regulations (like 21 CFR 202) and guidance interpretations that restrict truthful, non-misleading communication about dFDA trials (including appropriately contextualized real-time data trends) and emerging RWE for approved drugs (including off-label uses). Rely on transparency and anti-fraud laws.
*   **Develop Frameworks for Dynamic Data:** Develop new guidance frameworks for how efficacy and safety information based on dynamic, platform-generated evidence rankings can be communicated truthfully and non-misleadingly.
*   **Standardize Presentation:** Establish standards via guidance for presenting continuously updated, probabilistic outcome data from platforms to patients and providers.
*   **Clarify Advertising Rules:** Clarify how traditional advertising rules (e.g., fair balance) apply, or should be adapted, when effectiveness data is constantly evolving on a platform.
*   **Permit DTC Trial Advertising:** Explicitly allow truthful, non-misleading DTC advertising regarding specific trials operating on the dFDA platform via revised interpretation or guidance. Repeal interpretations hindering such communication.
