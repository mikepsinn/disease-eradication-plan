# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### Last Name

### Email

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Data (21 CFR 312.120)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR 312.120

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

This regulation outlines the conditions under which the FDA will accept foreign clinical studies not conducted under an IND as support for an IND or marketing application. It generally requires such studies to have been conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), including review by an independent ethics committee (IEC), and for FDA to be able to validate the data.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both.

While facilitating the use of some foreign data, the regulation can create hurdles in the context of global, platform-based trials:
*   **Demonstrating GCP Equivalence:** Proving that foreign studies met GCP standards equivalent to U.S. requirements can sometimes be burdensome or ambiguous, especially for older studies or those from regions with differing regulatory landscapes.
*   **Validation Challenges:** FDA validation of foreign data can be resource-intensive.
*   **Integration Barriers:** May create perceived or real barriers to seamlessly integrating and pooling data generated globally via a standardized platform like dFDA, if adherence to the platform's certified processes isn't automatically accepted as meeting data quality standards.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Ensuring the quality and integrity of foreign data used for U.S. regulatory decisions is important. However, the process for acceptance should be adapted for data generated on globally standardized, certified platforms.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, modify the regulation or associated guidance:
*   **Platform Adherence as Equivalence:** Establish clear pathways via guidance or regulation modification to **deem adherence to a standardized, certified dFDA platform's protocols and data integrity standards as sufficient evidence of data quality and integrity**, fulfilling the core intent of GCP equivalence for data generated anywhere globally on that platform.
*   **Harmonized Standards:** Further harmonize data standards and platform validation requirements internationally (linking with MRA modifications) to facilitate seamless global data pooling and acceptance.
*   **Streamlined Validation:** Develop streamlined processes for FDA validation of foreign data generated via certified platforms, potentially relying more on platform audit trails and remote data verification.
*   **Repeal Duplicative Requirements:** Repeal requirements for sponsors to separately document or demonstrate GCP equivalence for foreign sites participating through a fully certified dFDA platform, where the platform itself ensures standardized procedures and data quality.
