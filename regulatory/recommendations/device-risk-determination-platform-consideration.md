# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Device Risk Determination for Clinical Trials (21 CFR 812.3(m) - Definition of Significant Risk Device; related IRB/IDE Guidance)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR 812.3(m); FDA Guidance Documents on Significant Risk and Non-Significant Risk Medical Device Studies & IRB Responsibilities.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations and guidances define "Significant Risk" (SR) and "Non-Significant Risk" (NSR) devices for the purpose of clinical investigations. This determination dictates the regulatory pathway: SR device studies require both IRB approval and an FDA-approved Investigational Device Exemption (IDE), while NSR device studies generally only require IRB approval (though FDA can disagree with an NSR determination).

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both.

While intended to provide risk-based oversight, the SR/NSR determination process can be subjective and may not fully account for the mitigating effects of modern trial platforms:
*   **Subjectivity:** Determining whether a device presents a potential for serious risk can be subjective, leading to variability in determinations by sponsors and IRBs.
*   **IDE Burden:** An SR determination triggers the significant burden of preparing and obtaining FDA approval for an IDE application, delaying study start.
*   **Ignores Platform Mitigation:** Current guidance for making the SR/NSR determination doesn't explicitly instruct IRBs/sponsors to consider the mitigating effect of enhanced safety monitoring capabilities provided by certified digital platforms like dFDA.
*   **Potential Over-Classification:** Lack of consideration for platform monitoring might lead to more studies being classified as SR than necessary if the platform provides robust, real-time oversight.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Risk-based oversight distinguishing SR and NSR studies is appropriate. However, the factors considered in the determination should be updated.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, guidance for IRBs and sponsors regarding SR/NSR determinations should be modified:
*   **Consider Platform Monitoring:** Modify relevant FDA guidance to explicitly instruct IRBs and sponsors to **consider the presence and validated capabilities of a certified dFDA platform's real-time safety monitoring and data capture features** as a mitigating factor when making SR/NSR determinations.
*   **Justify NSR Classification:** Allow the enhanced oversight and safety features provided by a certified platform to be used as justification for classifying more device studies as NSR, where appropriate based on the overall risk profile.
*   **Reduce IDE Requirements:** Consequently, reduce the number of trials requiring full IDE submissions to FDA by allowing platform capabilities to support NSR determinations.
*   **Repeal Contradictory Interpretations:** Repeal any existing guidance interpretations that prevent platform monitoring capabilities from being formally considered in the risk classification process for device trials.
