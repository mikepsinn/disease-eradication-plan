# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Formal Meetings Between FDA and Sponsors/Applicants (FDA MAPP/Guidance Documents, e.g., "Formal Meetings Between the FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products")

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA Guidance Documents and Manuals of Policies and Procedures (MAPPs) governing formal meetings (e.g., Type A, B, C meetings).

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These guidances and procedures outline the processes for requesting, preparing for, conducting, and documenting formal meetings between the FDA and sponsors/applicants at various stages of product development (e.g., pre-IND, end-of-phase 2, pre-NDA/BLA/PMA). The goal is to provide a structured mechanism for communication, feedback, and agreement on development plans.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While providing valuable interaction opportunities, the formal meeting process can be resource-intensive and potentially less necessary in certain platform-based scenarios:

* **Resource Intensive:** Preparing briefing packages, scheduling meetings, and dedicating significant time from both sponsor and FDA personnel consumes substantial resources.
* **Potential Redundancy:** For trials utilizing certified dFDA platforms with standardized protocols, validated components, and transparent real-time data, some traditional meeting objectives (e.g., discussing protocol design, data monitoring plans) might become redundant or achievable through more efficient means.
* **Slows Timelines:** Scheduling and waiting for formal meetings can introduce delays into the development timeline.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Formal meetings remain valuable for complex or novel issues. However, the *necessity* for such meetings should be reduced where platforms provide sufficient clarity and standardization.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, relevant FDA guidance and MAPPs should be modified:

* **Reduce/Waive Necessity for Platform Trials:** Issue guidance or modify MAPPs to **significantly reduce or explicitly waive the presumed necessity for certain formal pre-submission meetings** (e.g., pre-IND, end-of-phase) for trials utilizing certified dFDA platforms and standardized or platform-validated protocols.
* **Promote Asynchronous Communication:** Encourage greater reliance on platform-based protocol checks, standardized documentation provided via the platform, and asynchronous communication methods (e.g., secure messaging, shared digital workspaces) as alternatives to formal meetings for routine discussions.
* **Focus Meetings on Novel Issues:** Reserve formal meetings primarily for genuinely novel scientific or regulatory issues, complex development challenges, or significant disagreements not resolvable through other means.
* **Repeal Mandatory Meeting Policies:** Repeal internal FDA policies or guidance interpretations that effectively mandate certain formal meetings where the use of a certified platform and standardized approaches provides sufficient clarity and information.
