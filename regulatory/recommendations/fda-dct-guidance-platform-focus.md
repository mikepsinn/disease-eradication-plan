# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

FDA Guidances on Decentralized Clinical Trials (DCTs) (e.g., "Decentralized Clinical Trials for Drugs, Biological Products, and Devices")

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Various FDA Guidance Documents (e.g., "Decentralized Clinical Trials for Drugs, Biological Products, and Devices")

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These guidances are intended to provide recommendations for sponsors, investigators, and other stakeholders on implementing decentralized clinical trials (DCTs). They aim to clarify FDA's current thinking on DCT design and conduct, including the use of digital health technologies (DHTs), remote monitoring, and direct-to-participant trial activities, to facilitate broader adoption of these flexible approaches.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While helpful in providing initial clarity, existing DCT guidances often lack the specificity needed to fully enable large-scale, platform-based decentralized research like dFDA:

* **Need for Greater Clarity:** Key areas still require more specific guidance, including standards for validating digital technologies (central platforms, peripheral sensors/apps), ensuring data integrity from remote sources, and best practices for remote monitoring.
* **Platform Validation:** Guidance on validating the *central trial platform technology itself* (software, algorithms, security) as distinct from individual peripheral devices is underdeveloped.
* **Interoperability Standards:** While mentioning standards like FHIR, the guidance doesn't yet establish clear *requirements* or pathways for ensuring deep interoperability between platforms, EHRs, patient devices, and regulatory bodies.
* **State/International Alignment:** Guidance often acknowledges challenges with inconsistent state/international laws (telehealth, prescribing, data privacy) but doesn't provide strong solutions or pathways for federal preemption/harmonization needed for seamless platform operation.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Guidance on DCTs is necessary and evolving. It should be significantly expanded and made more specific, particularly addressing platform-centric models.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, existing guidance should be expanded, and new, more specific guidance issued:

* **Issue Further Guidance:** Address specific DCT challenges in greater detail (e.g., remote source documentation, management of decentralized investigational products, roles/responsibilities in remote settings).
* **Platform Validation Pathways:** Define clear validation pathways and technical standards via guidance for the **central dFDA trial platform technology itself** (software, core algorithms, security infrastructure).
* **Peripheral Tech Validation:** Provide clearer guidance on validating peripheral technologies integrated with the platform (sensors, apps), potentially allowing platform certification to streamline validation of connected tools.
* **Mandate Interoperability Standards:** Establish and potentially mandate via guidance specific interoperability standards (e.g., FHIR APIs) for robust data exchange between certified platforms, EHRs, patient devices, and regulatory systems.
* **Address State/International Harmonization:** Actively propose solutions or pathways within guidance (or advocate separately) for harmonizing or preempting conflicting state and international requirements (telehealth, remote prescribing, data privacy) necessary for seamless cross-jurisdictional platform operation.
