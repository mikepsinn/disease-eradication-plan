### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Central Platform Certification & Third-Party Roles Pathway (Requires New Guidance / Modification of DCT, SaMD, Quality System Regulation & BIMO Guidance)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

New FDA Guidance Document needed; Modifications potentially to 21 CFR Part 820 (QSR), BIMO Program Manual, DCT Guidance, SaMD Guidance.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

Existing guidances (DCT, SaMD) and regulations (QSR, BIMO) aim to ensure the quality, reliability, and integrity of clinical trial data, software systems, manufacturing processes, and regulatory oversight. They establish standards for validation, quality management, and inspections.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

Current frameworks lack a specific, efficient pathway for certifying the core infrastructure of a large-scale, multi-functional clinical trial platform like dFDA. This leads to:

* **Regulatory Uncertainty:** Sponsors and platform developers face uncertainty about how FDA will evaluate the core platform's reliability and security.
* **Duplicative Reviews:** Without platform certification, regulators may feel compelled to scrutinize processes (data capture, monitoring, analysis) individually for each trial run on the platform, leading to inefficiency.
* **Lack of Third-Party Leverage:** No clear framework exists for formally recognizing accredited third-party organizations to conduct aspects of platform certification or ongoing audits, limiting scalability and potentially overburdening FDA resources.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

Not applicable, as this primarily requires new guidance and modification of existing frameworks.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, new guidance should be issued, and related regulations/guidance modified:

* **Develop Platform Certification Guidance:** Develop and issue specific new guidance establishing a clear regulatory pathway, technical standards (covering security, data integrity, algorithm validation, quality systems), and processes for the certification of dFDA-like platforms.
* **Define Third-Party Roles:** Modify relevant regulations (e.g., 21 CFR Part 820) and inspection/audit guidance (e.g., BIMO Manual) to formally define the standards, accreditation process, scope of work, and FDA oversight mechanisms for **qualified third-party organizations** to conduct aspects of platform certification, remote audits, or algorithm validations. This leverages external expertise and enhances scalability.
* **Link Certification to Reduced Scrutiny:** Explicitly state in relevant guidances (IND, GCP, Monitoring) that successful certification of the platform will allow for significantly reduced regulatory scrutiny of specific processes for trials conducted *on* that platform.
