### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

Postmarket Safety Reporting Requirements (e.g., 21 CFR Part 822 - Postmarket Surveillance for devices; 21 CFR 314.80 - Postmarketing reporting of adverse drug experiences; FAERS database requirements)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 822; 21 CFR 314.80; Related guidances on postmarket safety reporting and FAERS/MAUDE databases.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations require manufacturers and other entities to monitor the safety of marketed products and report certain adverse events and other safety information to the FDA (e.g., through systems like FAERS for drugs/biologics or MAUDE for devices). The goal is to enable FDA to identify potential safety problems with marketed products that were not apparent during pre-market testing and take action to protect public health.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both.

While essential for ongoing safety monitoring, the current separate post-market reporting systems can be duplicative and inefficient when integrated platforms exist:
*   **Duplication of Effort:** For products evaluated and continuously monitored on a dFDA platform, separate reporting of adverse events to systems like FAERS/MAUDE represents a duplicative effort, as the platform itself captures this data in real-time.
*   **Reporting Burden:** Manual reporting to separate databases imposes administrative burdens on manufacturers.
*   **Data Silos:** Creates separate data silos (FAERS/MAUDE) rather than integrating post-market safety data directly with the comprehensive longitudinal data potentially available within the dFDA platform.
*   **Inefficiency:** Traditional passive reporting systems can be slow to detect signals compared to potential real-time, active surveillance and analysis within a dedicated platform.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

Specific reporting requirements should be repealed for products monitored via a certified dFDA platform. The principle of post-market surveillance remains crucial, but the *method* of achieving it should leverage the platform's capabilities.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations and guidance should be modified to recognize platform-based surveillance:
*   **Repeal Duplicative Reporting:** Repeal regulations (e.g., 21 CFR 314.80, parts of 822) mandating separate submission of post-market adverse event reports to FDA databases (FAERS/MAUDE) for products actively monitored on a certified dFDA platform where FDA has appropriate access to the platform's real-time safety data and analytics.
*   **Platform as Fulfillment:** Modify regulations/guidance to explicitly state that a certified dFDA platform with robust, real-time safety monitoring, signal detection, and analysis capabilities can fulfill traditional post-market surveillance and reporting requirements.
*   **API Integration (Alternative):** Alternatively, mandate API integration for automated adverse event reporting directly from certified platforms into FDA safety databases, eliminating manual reporting.
*   **Minimize Separate Studies:** Allow the continuous monitoring capabilities of the dFDA platform to replace or significantly reduce the need for separate mandated post-marketing studies (e.g., under 21 CFR Part 822 for devices or PMRs/PMCs for drugs) where the platform provides equivalent or superior ongoing safety and effectiveness data.
