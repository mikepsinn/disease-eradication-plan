# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

FDA Guidance related to Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) Requirements (e.g., Pediatric Study Plans: Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

FDA Guidance Document (Example: "Pediatric Study Plans: Content of and Process for Submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans and Amended Initial Pediatric Study Plans")

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

Guidance related to PREA is intended to help sponsors comply with the statutory requirement to conduct pediatric studies for certain drug and biological products. It outlines the process and content for submitting Initial Pediatric Study Plans (iPSPs), which detail the planned pediatric studies, aiming to ensure that necessary pediatric data is obtained in a timely manner.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While promoting pediatric research, the current process as outlined in guidance can present challenges:

* **Timing/Detail of iPSPs:** Requirements for submitting detailed iPSPs early in development can be burdensome, especially when adult data is still limited or trial designs are adaptive.
* **Integration with Decentralized Models:** Existing guidance may not adequately address the specific considerations for conducting required pediatric studies using decentralized trial (DCT) models or integrated platforms like dFDA.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Ensuring pediatric data is collected is important. The guidance implementing the process, however, should be adapted.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, guidance should be modified to provide flexibility and address modern trial approaches:

* **Increase Flexibility:** Modify guidance to allow more flexibility in the timing and level of detail required for initial iPSP submissions, potentially allowing for more iterative refinement as adult data emerges.
* **DCT/Platform Guidance:** Provide explicit guidance on integrating required pediatric studies onto decentralized platforms like dFDA. This should include clearly defined acceptable methods for remote consent/assent processes for children, validation standards for pediatric-specific remote data collection tools (e.g., apps, sensors), and data privacy considerations unique to minors in a DCT setting.
