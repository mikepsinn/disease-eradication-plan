# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

FDA Import Regulations (e.g., 21 CFR Part 1, Subpart E - Registration of Food Facilities; related regulations/policies for drugs/devices)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

Example: 21 CFR Part 1, Subpart E; Other relevant CFR parts and FDA import policies/guidance.

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations and policies govern the importation of FDA-regulated products (foods, drugs, devices, biologics, etc.) into the United States. They are intended to ensure that imported products meet the same standards for safety, efficacy, and quality as domestically produced goods, protecting U.S. consumers.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both.

While necessary for safety, existing import regulations can create significant hurdles for global decentralized clinical trials (DCTs) that involve direct-to-patient shipping or international sourcing:
*   **Barriers to Direct-to-Patient Shipping:** Complex import procedures, documentation requirements, and potential customs delays can make direct-to-patient shipment of investigational products from outside the U.S. difficult or impractical.
*   **Complexity for Global Trials:** Managing import/export requirements across multiple countries for investigational products, supplies, and biological samples in a global DCT adds significant logistical complexity and cost.
*   **Lack of Harmonization:** Differences between U.S. import regulations and those of other countries can further complicate international trial logistics.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. Oversight of imported medical products is necessary. However, the regulations and processes should be streamlined and adapted to facilitate legitimate, well-controlled global clinical trials using modern logistics.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, regulations and policies should be modified:
*   **Streamline for DCTs:** Modify regulations or issue specific guidance to streamline import/export procedures specifically for investigational products, devices, and supplies used within registered, platform-based DCTs like dFDA.
*   **Direct-to-Patient Pathways:** Ensure clear, efficient pathways exist for compliant direct-to-patient shipping of investigational products across borders for participants enrolled in certified platform trials.
*   **Harmonization:** Actively work with international regulatory partners to harmonize import/export requirements for clinical trial materials to facilitate seamless global trial logistics and data generation.
*   **Platform Integration:** Explore integrating tracking and documentation for imported trial supplies within the certified dFDA platform itself to potentially simplify customs clearance and regulatory oversight.
