# Help DOGE Improve Regulations to Accelerate BioMedical Innovation

### First Name

### What is the rule, regulation (federal register entry), or agency guidance document (not statutes, sorry!) you'd like modified or rescinded?

21 CFR Part 50 & 45 CFR Part 46 - Protection of Human Subjects (Informed Consent)

### What is the respective Federal register entry? (if an agency guidance document, write that)

21 CFR Part 50 (FDA) & 45 CFR Part 46 (HHS Common Rule)

### Tell me what the rule, regulation or guidance document is supposed to do (be generous to it)

These regulations establish the ethical principles and requirements for obtaining legally effective informed consent from human subjects before they participate in research. The goal is to ensure that potential participants understand the nature of the research, its risks and potential benefits, and their rights, so they can make a voluntary and informed decision about participation.

### Tell me what it actually does (i.e. what are the its impact, intentional or unintentional - details and numbers are helpful here even if estimates). If both good and bad impacts exist, address both

While essential for ethical research, the implementation of informed consent regulations often results in practices that hinder comprehension and add burden:

* **Length/Complexity:** Informed Consent Forms (ICFs) are frequently excessively long, complex, and filled with legal jargon, potentially overwhelming participants and obscuring key information rather than clarifying it (often viewed as paternalistic).
* **Administrative Burdens:** Managing translations, updates (e.g., for protocol amendments), and re-consenting processes can be administratively burdensome and costly.
* **Waiver Limitations:** Requirements for obtaining waivers of consent can be restrictive, even for minimal-risk research or secondary data use.
* **Suitability for Remote/Digital:** Traditional paper-based consent processes are poorly suited for decentralized trials (DCTs) and digital interactions.
* **Barriers to Secondary Use:** Consent processes often make it difficult to obtain broad consent for future, unspecified secondary research use of data, even if anonymized.

### Should it be rescinded, and if so, why? (remember, if something has some good impact, it may be hard to rescind without a replacement, so modifying may be the better course)

No. The principle of voluntary, informed consent is fundamental to ethical research. However, prescriptive requirements regarding the format and process, and interpretations hindering secondary data use, should be repealed or modified to focus on comprehension and autonomy, leveraging modern technology.

### Should it be modified and if so, how?

Yes, modified to focus on true understanding, autonomy, and efficiency:

* **Encourage Shorter/Clearer ICFs:** Encourage or mandate shorter, clearer ICFs using plain language via guidance.
* **Safe Harbor for eConsent:** Establish clear technical and procedural standards via guidance for validating platform-based electronic consent (e-consent) tools, including identity verification, comprehension assessment (e.g., interactive quizzes), and ongoing consent management. Provide safe harbor for sponsors using validated tools.
* **Repeal Prescriptive Requirements:** Repeal prescriptive regulations or guidance interpretations regarding specific formatting or processes that do not directly contribute to ensuring participant understanding and voluntariness.
* **Simplify Waivers:** Simplify requirements for consent waivers for minimal-risk research and secondary data use, especially for data collected via certified platforms with robust privacy controls.
* **Dynamic/Modular Consent:** Support the development and use (via guidance) of dynamic, modular consent approaches suitable for adaptive platform trials, allowing participants to consent to core participation and opt-in/out of specific optional components or future uses.
* **Facilitate Secondary Use:** Modify guidance to explicitly facilitate broad **opt-out** consent models for secondary research use of appropriately anonymized/aggregated dFDA data, with choices clearly presented and managed via the platform. Repeal interpretations hindering such secondary use when robust, patient-controlled privacy mechanisms are in place.
