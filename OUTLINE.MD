# The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ending War and Disease: Master Outline (Complete High-Resolution Version)

## Part I: The Problem (Your Democracy Is Dead and Your Genes Want You Dead)

### Chapter 1: Evolution Made You a Slave to Dead People's DNA
- **The Selfish Gene's Suicide Mission**: You're a meat robot for dead people's code
  - Dawkins was right: You're a "survival machine" for molecules
  - The homunculi controlling you: Pleasure and pain are DNA's carrot and stick
  - Your genes want you dead at 30 after breeding (mission accomplished)
  - The genetic lottery: You didn't choose any of this
- **Your Caveman Brain in a Space Age**: 200,000-year-old software, nuclear hardware
  - Tribalism: Great for fighting lions, terrible for global cooperation
  - Dunbar's number: You can only care about 150 people (everyone else can die)
  - Threat detection: You fear terrorists (25K deaths) more than heart disease (18M deaths)
  - The amygdala hijack: Why fear beats facts every time
- **The Evolutionary Trap**: Why we choose violence over medicine
  - In-group cooperation, out-group murder (it's in your DNA)
  - The warrior gene: 40% of us literally evolved to kill
  - Why peace feels wrong: Your amygdala needs an enemy
  - The reproduction imperative: War gets you laid (evolution is gross)

### Chapter 2: The $119 Trillion Death Toilet (Where Your Money Goes to Die)

  - China already hacked our nuclear systems (we're funding their military)
  - Every submarine = 1,000 cancer labs we didn't build
  - The nuclear extinction lottery: 13,000 warheads, 0 winners
- **Disease: The Holocaust in Slow Motion** ($109.1T/year in preventable suffering)
  - Cancer: 10M deaths/year while we argue about pronouns
  - Mental illness: 1 billion suffering, $5T lost productivity
  - Healthcare spending: $8.2T globally (mostly treating, not curing)
  - Rare diseases: 95% have zero treatments (your kids will die)
- **Medical Research: The Pocket Change** ($68B = 0.06% of the problem)
  - We spend more on Halloween costumes than curing cancer
  - The military's toilet seats cost more than malaria research
  - One fighter jet = entire rare disease research budget
  - Viagra got more funding than Alzheimer's (priorities!)
- **The 1972 Catastrophe: When Your Wages Got Divorced From Your Work**
  - Nixon kills gold standard: Money becomes meaningless paper
  - Productivity up 246%, wages up 115% (where'd the money go?)
  - The Fed: 12 unelected people playing god with your savings
  - Every financial crisis: The house always wins, you always lose
  - The cantillon effect: Money printers get rich, you get poor

### Chapter 3: Democracy Is Already Dead (Princeton Proved It)
- **The Princeton Bombshell: You Have Zero Political Power**
  - Gilens & Page study: 0% correlation between public opinion and policy
  - Economic elites get what they want 78% of the time
  - You get what you want 0% (unless elites agree)
  - The last 50 years: Every major policy against public will
  - The oligarchy with democratic characteristics (that's you, America)
- **Your Vote Is Mathematically Meaningless**
  - Probability your vote matters: 1 in 60 million
  - Time cost of being informed: 1,000 hours/year
  - Rational ignorance: It's literally stupid to pay attention
  - The paradox: Everyone knows it's broken, nobody can fix it
- **The Representation Illusion: 535 People Pretending to Represent 335 Million**
  - Your "representative" has 750,000 constituents (you get 0.00013%)
  - They spend 70% of their time fundraising, not representing
  - Party platforms: 1,000 positions you never chose
  - Gerrymandering: They pick voters, not vice versa

  - No coherence: Conflicting mandates everywhere
  - The solution: Micro-decisions with macro-coherence
- **The Democracy That Never Was**
  - Athens: Only 10% could vote (slaves don't count)
  - America: Designed for landowners, not you
  - Modern "democracy": Choose between two pre-selected options
  - The real system: Oligarchy with democratic theater

## Part II: The Theory (Why Markets Work and Democracy Doesn't)

### Chapter 4: Why Central Planning Kills People 
- **The Pattern: Every Government "War" Creates More of What It Fights**
  - War on Drugs ($1T): Created cartels, violence up 10,000%
  - War on Poverty ($22T): Welfare cliffs keep people poor
  - War on Cancer (Nixon 1971): $200B/year treating, not curing
  - War on Terror ($8T): Every drone strike creates 10 terrorists
  - The perverse incentive: Bureaucracies need problems to exist
- **The Knowledge Problem (Hayek Was Right)**
  - 200 NIH bureaucrats can't know 8 billion health needs
  - Every patient knows their pain (committees know PowerPoints)
  - Soviet agriculture: Smart people, 100 million starved
  - NIH medicine: Smart people, 55 million die annually
  - The pretense of knowledge: Central planning always fails
- **Markets: The Distributed Computer That Works**
  - Prices are information packets (committees are noise)
  - RECOVERY trial: $500 vs $41,000 per patient (80X efficiency)
  - Pre-1962 medicine: Doctors prescribed, patients decided
  - Software/Internet: No FDA = exponential innovation
  - Lasik/cosmetic surgery: Cash markets = 50% price drops
- **Public Choice Theory: Everyone's Selfish, Use It**
  - Politicians maximize power, not health (2-year horizons)
  - Bureaucrats maximize budgets (bigger = more power)
  - Defense contractors: $100M lobbying → $2T contracts
  - The solution: Make curing more profitable than treating
  - Align incentives or die (literally)

### Chapter 5: The War on Disease - The First War Designed to Win
- **Different Structure: Markets Not Ministries**
  - No bureaucracy to preserve (smart contracts)
  - Payment for outcomes, not process
  - Competition between solutions, not monopoly
  - Researchers get rich by curing, not by getting grants
  - The system dies when disease dies (that's the point)
- **Aligned Incentives: Everyone Wins by Winning**
  - Patients: Paid to participate, not exploited
  - Researchers: Rewarded for cures, not papers
  - Investors: Returns from health, not sickness
  - Politicians: Elected for results, not promises

  - The end of central planning's credibility
  - The beginning of the market revolution

### Chapter 6: Public Choice Theory (Everyone's a Selfish Prick, Use It)
- **Politicians Maximize Power, Not Your Health**
  - Time horizons: 2-year election cycles vs 20-year cures
  - Blame avoidance > credit claiming (do nothing, stay safe)
  - Their healthcare is free (yours isn't their problem)
  - Concentrated benefits, diffuse costs (you always lose)
- **The Interest Group Auction House**
  - Defense contractors: $100M lobbying → $2T contracts
  - You: Pay $1,000/year, too small to notice
  - They organize, you don't (and never will)
  - The lobbyist ROI: 1,813% returns (best investment ever)
- **Bureaucrats: The Permanent Government**
  - Budget maximization: Bigger department = more power
  - Risk minimization: Never try anything new
  - Job security: Can't be fired, won't innovate
  - The iron law: Every bureaucracy becomes self-serving
- **The Solution: Align Incentives or Die**
  - Make curing disease more profitable than causing it
  - Bribe the same people, but for health
  - Use greed for good (it's the only reliable force)

  - Reed's Law: Group forming = 2^N (exponential power)
  - The internet beat every centralized network
  - Your brain: 86 billion neurons > any central processor

## Part III: The Solution (Wishocracy: Real Democracy Finally)

### Chapter 8: Wishocracy - Tinder for the Federal Budget
- **The Innovation: Budget Allocation Through Micro-Decisions**
  - See two options: "Cancer research" vs "F-35 maintenance"
  - Slide to allocate: 80% cancer, 20% jet (your choice)

  - The missing trillions: Printed for bombs, not cures
- **The Federal Reserve: A Private Corporation That Owns You**
  - 12 unelected people control your savings value
  - No audit allowed (what are they hiding?)
  - $300B annually to banks in "reverse repo" (your money)
  - Bailouts for banks, bankruptcy for you
  - The only solution: Make war funding impossible
- **Why We Can't Reform the Fed (It's Terminal)**
  - Captured by military-banking complex (unfixable)
  - Dollar is global reserve (can't be reformed)
  - Too many wars depend on money printer
  - Solution: Bypass it entirely with direct funding
  - VICTORY bonds: Peace funded by markets, not money printing

### Chapter 11: VICTORY Bonds - Better Than Medallion Fund
- **The Instrument: Beating Every Investment Ever**

    - Prevents frivolous treatment seeking
    - "Free" = infinite demand = system collapse
    - Skin in the game = better decisions
    - Still 80% cheaper than current system
  - Why subsidize patients, not researchers:
    - NIH: 200 people guess what might work
    - DIH: Millions of sick people know what they need
    - No grant-writing theater (6 months → 6 minutes)
    - Results determine funding (work = wealth, fail = pivot)
  - Capture-proof because capture doesn't scale:
