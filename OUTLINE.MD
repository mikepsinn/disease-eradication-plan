    - Not committees picking winners
    - Not lobbyists writing bills

    - Patient treatment subsidies (majority of funds)
    - VICTORY bond returns (keeping our promise to investors)

    - Performance rewards (what actually worked gets more)
    - Community campaigns (when 50,000 people want something, it happens)
