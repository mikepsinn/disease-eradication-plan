# The Complete Idiot's Guide to Ending War and Disease: Master Outline (Complete High-Resolution Version)

## Part I: The Problem (Your Democracy Is Dead and Your Genes Want You Dead)

### Chapter 1: Evolution Made You a Slave to Dead People's DNA
- **The Selfish Gene's Suicide Mission**: You're a meat robot for dead people's code
  - Dawkins was right: You're a "survival machine" for molecules
  - The homunculi controlling you: Pleasure and pain are DNA's carrot and stick
  - Your genes want you dead at 30 after breeding (mission accomplished)
  - The genetic lottery: You didn't choose any of this
- **Your Caveman Brain in a Space Age**: 200,000-year-old software, nuclear hardware
  - Tribalism: Great for fighting lions, terrible for global cooperation
  - Dunbar's number: You can only care about 150 people (everyone else can die)
  - Threat detection: You fear terrorists (25K deaths) more than heart disease (18M deaths)
  - The amygdala hijack: Why fear beats facts every time
- **The Evolutionary Trap**: Why we choose violence over medicine
  - In-group cooperation, out-group murder (it's in your DNA)
  - The warrior gene: 40% of us literally evolved to kill
  - Why peace feels wrong: Your amygdala needs an enemy
  - The reproduction imperative: War gets you laid (evolution is gross)

### Chapter 2: The $119 Trillion Death Toilet (Where Your Money Goes to Die)
- **War: Humanity's Favorite Hobby** ($9.7T/year buying corpses)
  - Direct costs: $2.7T on weapons that rust in warehouses
  - The Pentagon's magic trick: Lost $2.46T (oops!)
  - China already hacked our nuclear systems (we're funding their military)
  - Every submarine = 1,000 cancer labs we didn't build
  - The nuclear extinction lottery: 13,000 warheads, 0 winners
  - Switzerland's alternative: 0.7% on defense, $93K GDP per capita
- **Disease: The Holocaust in Slow Motion** ($109.1T/year in preventable suffering)
  - Cancer: 10M deaths/year while we argue about pronouns
  - Mental illness: 1 billion suffering, $5T lost productivity
  - Healthcare spending: $8.2T globally (mostly treating, not curing)
  - Rare diseases: 95% have zero treatments (your kids will die)
  - 44 YEARS since last major disease cured (polio 1979, nothing since)
- **Medical Research: The Pocket Change** ($68B = 0.06% of the problem)
  - We spend more on Halloween costumes than curing cancer
  - The military's toilet seats cost more than malaria research
  - One fighter jet = entire rare disease research budget
  - Viagra got more funding than Alzheimer's (priorities!)
  - 166 BILLION untested treatment combinations (we've tried 0.0001%)
- **Humanity's Budget as a Family Making $100,000/Year**
  - If global spending was a family budget:
    - Healthcare spending: $8,200 (treating symptoms after we're sick)
    - Military spending: $2,700 (home defense)
    - Medical research: $68 (finding actual cures)
  - The punchline: We spend 40X more on weapons than cures
  - The tragedy: We spend 115X more treating disease than curing it
  - The joke: One fighter jet costs more than all rare disease research combined
  - Visual: On a pie chart, the research slice (0.068%) is literally invisible
- **The 1972 Catastrophe: When Your Wages Got Divorced From Your Work**
  - Nixon kills gold standard: Money becomes meaningless paper
  - Productivity up 246%, wages up 115% (where'd the money go?)
  - The Fed: 12 unelected people playing god with your savings
  - Every financial crisis: The house always wins, you always lose
  - The cantillon effect: Money printers get rich, you get poor

### Chapter 3: Democracy Is Already Dead (Princeton Proved It)
- **The Princeton Bombshell: You Have Zero Political Power**
  - Gilens & Page study: 0% correlation between public opinion and policy
  - Economic elites get what they want 78% of the time
  - You get what you want 0% (unless elites agree)
  - The last 50 years: Every major policy against public will
  - The oligarchy with democratic characteristics (that's you, America)
- **Your Vote Is Mathematically Meaningless**
  - Probability your vote matters: 1 in 60 million
  - Time cost of being informed: 1,000 hours/year
  - Rational ignorance: It's literally stupid to pay attention
  - The paradox: Everyone knows it's broken, nobody can fix it
- **The Representation Illusion: 535 People Pretending to Represent 335 Million**
  - Your "representative" has 750,000 constituents (you get 0.00013%)
  - They spend 70% of their time fundraising, not representing
  - Party platforms: 1,000 positions you never chose
  - Gerrymandering: They pick voters, not vice versa
  - The median voter theorem: Everyone gets ignored
- **The Budget Black Box: $6 Trillion You Don't Control**
  - Omnibus bills: 2,000 pages passed at 2 AM
  - Earmarks: Trading your healthcare for someone's bridge
  - Baseline budgeting: Increases are automatic, cuts are impossible
  - The debt ceiling theater: Fake fights, real damage
  - The budget is 10,000 decisions you'll never influence
- **Regulatory Capture: The Foxes Own All Henhouses**
  - FDA run by ex-pharma executives (shocking!)
  - DoD run by future defense contractors (who could have guessed!)
  - The revolving door: 400% salary increase for playing ball
  - The IRS: 87,000 agents to squeeze you while billionaires pay zero
  - The Fed: Privately owned, publicly destroying your savings
- **Direct Democracy Fails Too (California Proved It)**
  - Information overload: 50 propositions = random voting
  - Special interest capture: Who writes the propositions?
  - No coherence: Conflicting mandates everywhere
  - Wishocracy solves this: Pairwise choices, not 50-item ballots
  - Anyone can propose, aggregation creates coherence
- **The Democracy That Never Was**
  - Athens: Only 10% could vote (slaves don't count)
  - America: Designed for landowners, not you
  - Modern "democracy": Choose between two pre-selected options
  - The real system: Oligarchy with democratic theater

## Part II: The Theory (Why Markets Work and Democracy Doesn't)

### Chapter 4: Why Central Planning Kills People 
- **The Pattern: Every Government "War" Creates More of What It Fights**
  - War on Drugs ($1T): Created cartels, violence up 10,000%
  - War on Poverty ($22T): Welfare cliffs keep people poor
  - War on Cancer (Nixon 1971): $200B/year treating, not curing
  - War on Terror ($8T): Every drone strike creates 10 terrorists
  - The perverse incentive: Bureaucracies need problems to exist
- **The Knowledge Problem (Hayek Was Right)**
  - 200 NIH bureaucrats can't know 8 billion health needs
  - Every patient knows their pain (committees know PowerPoints)
  - Soviet agriculture: Smart people, 100 million starved
  - NIH medicine: Smart people, 55 million die annually
  - The pretense of knowledge: Central planning always fails
- **Markets: The Distributed Computer That Works**
  - Prices are information packets (committees are noise)
  - RECOVERY trial: $500 vs $41,000 per patient (80X efficiency)
  - Pre-1962 medicine: Doctors prescribed, patients decided
  - Software/Internet: No FDA = exponential innovation
  - Lasik/cosmetic surgery: Cash markets = 50% price drops
- **Public Choice Theory: Everyone's Selfish, Use It**
  - Politicians maximize power, not health (2-year horizons)
  - Bureaucrats maximize budgets (bigger = more power)
  - Defense contractors: $100M lobbying → $2T contracts
  - The solution: Make curing more profitable than treating
  - Align incentives or die (literally)

### Chapter 5: The War on Disease - The First War Designed to Win
- **Different Structure: Markets Not Ministries**
  - No bureaucracy to preserve (smart contracts)
  - Payment for outcomes, not process
  - Competition between solutions, not monopoly
  - Researchers get rich by curing, not by getting grants
  - The system dies when disease dies (that's the point)
- **Aligned Incentives: Everyone Wins by Winning**
  - Patients: Subsidized treatments, not exploited
  - Researchers: Rewarded for cures, not papers
  - Investors: Returns from health, not sickness
  - Politicians: Elected for results, not promises
  - Perverse incentives minimized through market competition
- **Spillover Victory: Solving Everything Else**
  - War on Drugs: Addiction is a disease (actually cure it)
  - War on Poverty: Healthy people aren't poor
  - War on Terror: Mental health treatment prevents radicalization
  - War on Crime: Cure antisocial personality disorder
  - Every social problem has biological roots (fix the roots)
- **The Meta-Victory: Proving Markets > Government**
  - First successful "War on" anything ever
  - Template for everything else (education, housing, etc.)
  - The end of central planning's credibility
  - The beginning of the market revolution

### Chapter 6: Public Choice Theory (Everyone's a Selfish Prick, Use It)
- **Politicians Maximize Power, Not Your Health**
  - Time horizons: 2-year election cycles vs 20-year cures
  - Blame avoidance > credit claiming (do nothing, stay safe)
  - Their healthcare is free (yours isn't their problem)
  - Concentrated benefits, diffuse costs (you always lose)
- **The Interest Group Auction House**
  - Defense contractors: $100M lobbying → $2T contracts
  - You: Pay $1,000/year, too small to notice
  - They organize, you don't (and never will)
  - The lobbyist ROI: 1,813% returns (best investment ever)
- **Bureaucrats: The Permanent Government**
  - Budget maximization: Bigger department = more power
  - Risk minimization: Never try anything new
  - Job security: Can't be fired, won't innovate
  - The iron law: Every bureaucracy becomes self-serving
- **The Solution: Align Incentives or Die**
  - Make curing disease more profitable than causing it
  - Bribe the same people, but for health
  - Use greed for good (it's the only reliable force)
  - Create concentrated benefits for healing

### Chapter 7: The Wisdom of Crowds (8 Billion Geniuses > 200 Idiots)
- **Surowiecki Was Right About Everything**
  - The Ox: 800 farmers' average beat all experts
  - Wikipedia destroyed Britannica (amateurs beat professionals)
  - Jelly beans in jar: Crowd average within 1% (experts off by 20%)
  - Linux beat Windows Server (open source beat closed)
- **Prediction Markets: Crowdsourced Crystal Balls**
  - Elections: Markets 96% accurate, polls 60%
  - Drug trials: Markets predict FDA approval better than FDA
  - Everything else: Weather, sports, stocks (markets always win)
  - The Iowa Electronic Markets: Beat every pundit
- **The Superintelligence We Already Have**
  - 8 billion networked brains = planet-sized neural network
  - Collective IQ: Potentially infinite
  - Current use: Arguing on Twitter (what a waste)
  - Properly harnessed: Could solve everything
- **Network Effects: Why Decentralization Wins**
  - Metcalfe's Law: Value = N² (centralization = N)
  - Reed's Law: Group forming = 2^N (exponential power)
  - The internet beat every centralized network
  - Your brain: 86 billion neurons > any central processor

## Part III: The Solution (Wishocracy: Real Democracy Finally)

### Chapter 8: Wishocracy - Markets Not Majorities
- **The Innovation: Anyone Can Propose, Everyone Decides**
  - Open proposal system: ANY human can submit funding requests
  - Minimal stake required: Small bond prevents spam proposals
  - Random pairwise comparisons: Each voter sees different proposal pairs

  - No centralized control: Nobody decides what gets voted on
- **The Math: How Swipes Become Budgets**
  - Pairwise comparison: How your brain actually works
  - Condorcet aggregation: Finding true social preference
  - The law of large numbers: Noise cancels, signal emerges
  - Impossibility theorem solved: No cycles with enough voters
- **Why This Isn't Central Planning**
  - No committee decides what gets funded
  - No approval process for proposals
  - No human has more voting power than another
  - Emergent order from billions of micro-decisions
  - True market discovery of society's health priorities
- **Your AI Twin: Scaling to Infinite Decisions**
  - Learns from 100 choices, predicts 10,000
  - You audit and adjust (maintaining control)
  - Collective intelligence: 8 billion advisors
  - The hive mind: Smarter than any individual
- **The Feedback Loop: Democracy That Learns**
  - Every allocation tracked to outcomes
  - Good allocations get reinforced
  - Bad allocations get punished
  - The system gets smarter every cycle
- **The Incentive Layer: Democracy That Rewards**
  - Participation points for voting (gamification)
  - Good allocations earn reputation (competence rewarded)
  - Leaderboards and achievements (social proof)
  - Democracy becomes addictive (dopamine hits for voting)

### Chapter 9: The 1% Treaty (The Trojan Horse That Conquers Everything)
- **Start Tiny: Just 1% of Military Budgets**
  - $27B globally (Pentagon's couch cushion money)
  - No country loses relative power (everyone cuts equally)
  - Small enough to pass, big enough to matter
  - The precedent: If 1% works, why not 2%?
- **The Two-Tier Peace Dividend**
  - Captured Dividend: $24.4B to DIH treasury (direct military cuts)
  - Societal Dividend: $92B to humanity (total economic benefit)
    - Lost economic growth avoided: $24.4B
    - Infrastructure not destroyed: $18.8B
    - Lives not lost: $10B
    - Trade not disrupted: $6.2B
    - Veterans not created: $2B
    - Refugees not displaced: $1.5B
  - We fund DIH with the captured $24.4B
  - Society keeps the other $67.6B in value creation
- **What 1% Less War Buys in Health**
  - $27B funds 54,000 clinical trials at $500K each
  - Or 27 million patients in dFDA trials at $1,000 each
  - Equivalent to 540 new drug approvals (current rate: 50/year)
  - Could cure 10-20 rare diseases completely in Year 1
  - Prevention programs reaching 270 million people
  - Saves 180,000 lives annually (using standard QALY calculations)
- **The Game Theory: Everyone Wins or Nobody Plays**
  - Simultaneous reduction: No first-mover disadvantage
  - Verification: Budgets are public anyway
  - Defection punishment: Massive PR nightmare
  - Cooperation reward: Heroes of humanity
- **The Governance Revolution: First Wishocratic Budget Ever**
  - Anyone on Earth can propose how to spend the $27B
  - 280 million+ people directly allocating via pairwise choices
  - No representatives, no committees, no corruption
  - Your grandma's remedy competes with Big Pharma's drug
  - The proof-of-concept for replacing all government budgeting
- **The Ratchet: Success Breeds Hunger for More**
  - Year 1: Major advances in 15 disease areas
  - Year 2: 2% treaty (double the funding)
  - Year 5: 5% treaty (exponential progress)
  - Year 10: Military spending looks insane
  - Year 20: War is incomprehensible

## Part IV: The Money (How Everyone Gets Rich by Getting Healthy)

### Chapter 10: The Economic Case - 463:1 Return on Killing Disease
- **The ROI That Breaks Reality**
  - Investment: $40M annual platform cost
  - Return: $50B annual savings from trial efficiency alone
  - ROI: 463:1 (makes every other investment look stupid)
  - 10-year NPV: $249 billion in value creation
  - Comparison: Best hedge funds dream of 2:1 annual returns
  - Real-world proof: Switzerland's $93K GDP per capita from avoiding war
- **The Daily Holocaust of Inaction**
  - Every day we wait: $137 million burned in inefficiency
  - Every day we wait: 2,301 Quality-Adjusted Life Years lost
  - That's 840,000 QALYs lost annually (a mid-sized city dying)
  - Each hour: $5.7 million wasted, 96 people's life-years gone
  - While you read this sentence: $66,000 vanished, someone's year of life lost
- **The Dominant Intervention (Saves Money AND Lives)**
  - ICER: -$59,501 per QALY (negative = you profit while saving lives)
  - Normal interventions: Pay $50,000-150,000 per QALY
  - This intervention: GET PAID $59,501 per life-year saved
  - No trade-off between money and health (both improve)
  - First time in history: Healing is more profitable than harming
- **Prevention Economics: The 3X Multiplier**
  - Current prevention spending: 5% of healthcare (pathetic)
  - Prevention ROI: Every $1 spent saves $3 in treatment
  - Double prevention spending: $615B annual savings
  - Early detection via dFDA: Catching cancer at Stage 1 vs 4 = 90% cost reduction
  - Behavioral intervention: $100 app prevents $10,000 surgery
- **The $100 Billion Market We're Capturing**
  - Global clinical trial market: $100B annually
  - Our 50% efficiency gain: $50B annual savings (conservative)
  - Best case (95% reduction like RECOVERY): $95B annual savings
  - These aren't projections - Oxford already proved it works
  - Market capture: Even 10% adoption = $5B value creation
- **The Combined $142 Billion Annual Win**
  - Peace Dividend: $92B from 1% less conflict
  - dFDA Savings: $50B from trial efficiency
  - Total Direct Benefit: $142B every year
  - This is before any multiplier effects
  - Equivalent to ending world hunger 14 times over annually
- **The $16.5 Trillion Endgame (When Everything Compounds)**
  - Direct savings: $155.5B/year (military + trials + allocation)
  - Health value created: $126B/year (840,000 QALYs)
  - Economic multiplier effects: $16.2T/year when mature
    - Healthy people work more: +$8.4T productivity
    - No refugee crises: +$1.5T saved
    - Infrastructure preserved: +$1.9T not destroyed
    - Global trade flows: +$2.4T commerce
    - Innovation compounds: +$2.0T new industries
  - Total Annual Value at maturity: $16.5 TRILLION
  - That's more than China's entire GDP
  - ROI: 25,781:1 (not a typo)
- **The Compound Growth Timeline**
  - Year 1: $142B direct benefit (pays for itself 220x over)
  - Year 5: ~$1T as network effects kick in
  - Year 10: ~$5T as health improvements compound
  - Year 20: Full $16.5T annual value realized
  - Every second we wait: $522,539 destroyed forever

### Chapter 11: How Central Banks Fund Your Death (The War Machine's ATM)
- **The Problem: Every Fiat Currency in History Has Been Devalued To Fund Unpopular Wars**
  - Dollar: Created by Fed to fund WWI, still funding wars
  - Euro: ECB funds NATO expansions
  - Traditional fiat: Governments can print for war at will
  - Vietnam: $168B printed, your wages destroyed
  - Iraq/Afghanistan: $8T printed while cancer research got $68B
- **1972: When Nixon Weaponized Money Against You**
  - Killed gold standard to fund Vietnam without tax revolt
  - Productivity up 246%, wages up 115% (they stole the difference)
  - The cantillon effect: Banks get new money first, you get inflation
  - Every war since: Funded by destroying your purchasing power
  - The missing trillions: Printed for bombs, not cures
- **The Federal Reserve: A Private Corporation That Owns You**
  - 12 unelected people control your savings value
  - No audit allowed (what are they hiding?)
  - $300B annually to banks in "reverse repo" (your money)
  - Bailouts for banks, bankruptcy for you
  - The only solution: Make war funding impossible
- **Why We Can't Reform the Fed (It's Terminal)**
  - Captured by military-banking complex (unfixable)
  - Dollar is global reserve (can't be reformed)
  - Too many wars depend on money printer
  - Solution: Bypass it entirely with direct funding
  - VICTORY bonds: Peace funded by markets, not money printing

### Chapter 11: VICTORY Bonds - Better Than Medallion Fund
- **The Instrument: Beating Every Investment Ever**
  - Perpetual 5% of all DIH treasury inflows forever
  - Starting yield: 40% annually (beats Medallion's 39% CAGR)
  - Growth potential: Returns automatically scale as treasury grows
  - Fully tradable: Secondary markets with liquidity premium
  - Aligned incentives: Bondholders profit by growing DIH
- **The Math: Why This Beats Everything**
  - Total bonds issued: $3.375B hard cap (scarcity drives value)
  - 5% of $27B treasury = $1.35B annual distribution
  - $1.35B ÷ $3.375B bonds = 40% starting yield
  - As treaty expands (2%, 5%, 10%), returns scale proportionally
  - Inflation-protected: Tied to treaty inflows, not dying currencies
- **Why This Destroys All Competition**
  - S&P 500: 10% average (VICTORY: 40% starting, scaling up)
  - Venture capital: 25% if lucky (VICTORY: 40% guaranteed + growth)
  - Medallion Fund: 39% but can't scale (VICTORY: 40%+ and infinitely scalable)
  - Real estate: 15% with hassle (VICTORY: 40%+ liquid)
  - Defense contracts: 8-15% margins (VICTORY: 40%+ returns forever)
  - Alternative systems prove viability: Bitcoin hit $1T without governments, M-Pesa became Kenya's real economy
- **Why Defense Contractors Should Diversify**
  - Portfolio diversification: Hedge against peace breaking out
  - Pension fund stability: 40% returns for employee retirement
  - ESG compliance: Balance death merchant reputation
  - Liquidity advantage: Tradable vs locked government contracts
  - First-mover advantage: Limited $3.375B available
- **Use of Funds: The $3.375B War Chest**
  - $1.35B: Media blitz and education campaign
  - $1B: Lobbying (10X defense industry's annual $100M)
  - $675M: Technology platform (dFDA + Wishocracy)
  - $225M: Operations and contingency
  - $125M: Reserve for treaty implementation
  - Full transparency: Every dollar tracked publicly

### Chapter 12: The Coalition That Ends War (Aligned Incentives Beat Ideology)
- **Defense Contractors: Converting the Enemy**
  - VICTORY bonds: 40%+ perpetual returns > 8% defense margins
  - Medical device contracts from DIH (new revenue stream)
  - Their lobbyists work for highest bidder (that's us now)
  - Pension obligations: One bond purchase = funded forever
  - ESG pressure: From death merchants to health heroes
- **Insurance Companies: Natural Allies**
  - Healthy people = no claims = massive profits
  - Every cure = billions in reduced payouts
  - Investment opportunity: VICTORY bonds in their portfolios
  - Competitive advantage: Back us or competitors will
  - The math: Support us or go bankrupt from medical costs
- **Big Pharma: The Unexpected Convert**
  - Current model dying: Patent cliffs, R&D costs exploding
  - DIH = guaranteed customers for anything that works
  - Parallel pathway: Faster results, lower trial costs
  - Compete on outcomes, not marketing (their worst fear)
  - But: Winners make 10X current profits
- **Politicians: Making Corruption Work for Health**
  - Super PAC: Major funding for treaty supporters
  - Opposition research: Funded against enemies
  - District benefits: Research centers = jobs

  - 40%+ perpetual returns while saving humanity
  - Named institutes: "The Gates Cancer Center"
  - Tax benefits plus profit (have cake, eat it)
  - First movers get best terms and most credit
- **Everyone Else: Democracy That Pays**
  - Direct vote on budget allocation (real power)
  - Subsidized healthcare through dFDA trials (dynamic vouchers)
  - Your participation helps grow voucher size for everyone
  - Jobs in research and administration
  - Your diseases actually get cured

### Chapter 13: The Legal Architecture (Staying Out of Prison)
- **The Multi-Jurisdiction Strategy**
  - Swiss foundation: Neutral base of operations
  - Delaware C-corp: US operations
  - Singapore entity: Asian operations
  - Multiple legal structures: Risk distribution
  - Regulatory arbitrage: Always have options
- **The Securities Law Navigation**
  - VICTORY bonds: Structured as debt, not equity
  - Qualified purchaser exemptions

  - Full FEC disclosure (radical transparency)
  - State-by-state compliance (50 different laws)
  - Citizens United: Corporations are people (use it)
- **The Treaty Framework**
  - International law expertise
  - Vienna Convention compliance
  - Bilateral agreements first (easier)
  - Build to multilateral (inevitable)
  - Enforcement mechanisms built in
- **The Legislation Package** (Already drafted)
  - The Treaty Implementation Act (makes it binding)
  - The DIH Authorization Act (creates the institutes)
  - The dFDA Parallel Track Act (alternative pathway alongside FDA)
  - The Right to Try Expansion Act (patient choice beyond FDA)
  - The Budget Reallocation Act (moves the money)

## Part V: The Implementation (Building Paradise)

### Chapter 15: The Global Referendum (Democracy at Scale)
- **The Platform: Wishocracy App**
  - 30-second onboarding
  - Swipe interface for budget allocation
  - Share to earn rewards
  - Gamification: Leaderboards and achievements
  - Make voting engaging and rewarding
- **Identity Verification**
  - Government ID integration where available
  - Privacy-preserving biometrics
  - Social network verification
  - Bot prevention systems
  - Anonymous but verified voting
- **The Viral Growth Strategy**
  - Network effects: Each user brings 3.5 more
  - Influencer partnerships for launch
  - Social media campaign strategy
  - Time-limited signup windows create urgency
- **The 3.5% Magic Number**
  - No peaceful movement has failed at 3.5% active support
  - Our advantage: Economic incentive to participate
  - Current trajectory: 1M signups/day once viral
  - Tipping point: Day 280 critical mass achieved

### Chapter 16: The DIH - Government Without Governments
- **The Structure: Distributed Control**
  - $27B/year flows through transparent smart contracts
  - No CEO or board making unilateral decisions
  - Financial transactions public, medical records private
  - Progressive decentralization: System designed to become fully autonomous
  - AI governance: Automated code review and security verification
  - Core treaty terms locked, allocations democratically adjusted
- **How Wishocracy Controls the Treasury**
  - Anyone submits proposals: Researchers, patients, garage scientists
  - 8 billion people see random proposal pairs
    - "Sarah's long COVID trial" vs "MIT's cancer vaccine"
    - "Village clinic in Kenya" vs "Gene therapy for aging"
  - Billions of pairwise allocations create emergent consensus
  - Money flows automatically to top-ranked proposals
  - Zero human gatekeepers between ideas and funding
  - Core allocations (dynamically adjusted by the crowd):
    - Patient treatment subsidies (majority of funds)
    - VICTORY bond returns (5% of all inflows guaranteed)
    - Expansion campaigns (growing from 1% to 2% to 5%)
    - Performance rewards (what actually worked gets more)
    - Community campaigns (when 50,000 people want something, it happens)
  - Why dynamic subsidies work:
    - Researchers set prices on dFDA marketplace
    - Subsidies = available funds ÷ participating patients
    - Natural demand management (more patients = lower subsidy per person)
    - Prevents frivolous treatment seeking (patients pay unsubsidized portion)
    - Refundable data deposit ensures complete trial data
    - Creates patient incentive to organize for treasury growth
    - Patients self-organize for passage of 2%, 5%, 10% treaties = larger subsidies and lower costs
  - Why subsidize patients, not researchers:
    - NIH: 200 people guess what might work
    - DIH: Millions of sick people know what they need
    - No grant-writing theater (6 months → 6 minutes)
    - Results determine funding (work = wealth, fail = pivot)
  - Capture-proof because there's nothing to capture:
    - No approval committee to bribe
    - No gatekeeper to influence
    - Can't stop others from submitting competing proposals
    - Buying 10 million votes: Economically impossible
    - Gaming attempts get drowned in billions of honest allocations
- **Specialized Institutes**
  - Cancer Institute: Funded by public voting
  - Mental Health Institute: Finally gets proper funding
  - Aging Institute: Research on extending healthspan
  - Rare Disease Institute: Every disease matters
  - Emergency Response: Pandemic preparedness

### Chapter 17: The dFDA - The Amazon of Not Dying
- **The FDA's Catastrophic Failure (Why We Need This)**
  - 95% of diseases have ZERO FDA-approved treatments (your kid's rare disease = death sentence)
  - 17 YEARS from discovery to patient (you'll be dead before the cure arrives)
  - 85% of patients EXCLUDED from trials (too sick, too old, wrong zip code)
  - Current trials: $48,000 per patient (pharma passes cost to you)
