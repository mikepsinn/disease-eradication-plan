# Book Additions from Financial Roadmap Conversation

## New Section for Part III: The Solution

### The Financial Roadmap (NEW CHAPTER - Insert After "The Strategy")

**How to Bootstrap from $0 to $1 Billion Without Getting Arrested**

You want to end war and disease. You need $1 billion. You have $0.

Here's the 36-month roadmap from basement to bond market.

#### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Months 1-3) - The Only Thing That Matters

**Month 1: Build Wishocracy Voting Widget**
- **Cost:** $15,000 (one good contractor, 2 weeks)
- **What you're building:** Simple web app showing two spending options
- User drags slider: "Cancer research 60% vs Heart disease 40%"
- Aggregates using Condorcet method
- Shows real-time "crowd budget"

**Why this is all you need:** If you can't make people care enough to vote, you definitely can't make them care enough to donate/lobby/sign treaties.

**The market test:** "People get bored of me talking about pragmatic trials within minutes."

That's the market telling you something crucial. If you can't hold attention for 10 minutes, you can't mobilize 280 million people.

**Month 2: Raise $500K from Angels**

The pitch that actually works:

"We're not building trial infrastructure - Oxford and dozens of companies already do that. We're building the FUNDING mechanism. $1B in bonds bribes governments to redirect $27B/year. Your $500K buys 0.05% of all future inflows. Existing trial platforms get flooded with subsidized patients. Everyone wins except Raytheon."

**Month 3: Launch Referendum Platform V1**
- 30-second signup
- Single question: "Should nations redirect 1% of military spending to medical research?"
- Referral tracking
- Goal: 10,000 votes in 30 days at $5 per vote

If you hit 10,000 votes: You've proven something.
If you don't: The idea is dead.

#### Phase 2-6: [Use corrected roadmap from conversation]

**Key Insight:** You're not building trial infrastructure. You're building:
1. Wishocracy voting platform (governance)
2. Referendum app (political pressure)
3. VICTORY bond offering (financial bribery)
4. dFDA data aggregation (transparency layer)

**What you're NOT building:** Trial infrastructure, EHR integrations, drug supply chains, regulatory approval systems.

**Why:** Science37, TrialSpark, and CROs already run decentralized trials. Your job is to redirect $27 billion into a system that subsidizes patients, creating a massive new market that these platforms will compete to serve.

## Additions to Part VI: The Money

### MAJOR REVISION: "The Economic Case" Section

**New claim:** 1,122:1 ROI, $1.12 trillion annual benefit

#### The Complete Benefits Calculation

**Additional benefits to include:**
- Earlier access (timeline acceleration): $300B (10-year average)
- New diseases treatable: $400B
- Drug price reduction: $100B
- Prevention becoming viable: $100B
- Mental health impact: $75B

**Note:** Productivity gains, insurance savings, and longevity extension are outcomes of the above benefits, not separate line items to avoid double-counting.

#### The 9-Year Acceleration

**The insight:** The dFDA gives patients the right and ability to access treatments during Phase 2/3 trials instead of waiting 9.1 years for FDA approval (or forever if trials are never completed for their condition).

**How the acceleration works:**
- Current system: Wait 9.1 years average from Phase 1 to FDA approval
- dFDA system: Access treatment during Phase 2/3 pragmatic trials
- Effective acceleration: ~7 years earlier access on average (Phase 2 typically starts 1-2 years into development)

**This isn't speculative future acceleration - it's immediate access to treatments that already exist but are stuck in the approval pipeline.**

**Stock benefit (one-time):** Existing patients get immediate access
- 2 billion people with chronic diseases globally
- Each gains 7 years of treatment access they'd otherwise miss
- Total: 14 billion person-years × $150K/QALY = $2.1T total value
- **Amortized over 7-year acceleration period: $300B/year for years 1-7**

**Flow benefit (ongoing):** New patients each year get early access
- ~100M new chronic disease cases/year globally (based on 43M annual deaths × 2.3 prevalence/mortality ratio)
- Each saves 7 years × $150K/QALY = $1.05M in value
- **Annual flow: $105B/year ongoing (starts immediately, continues forever)**

**Combined "earlier access" benefit:**
- Years 1-7: $300B (amortized stock) + $105B (flow) = **$405B/year**
- Years 8+: $105B/year (flow only)
- **10-year average: ~$300B/year**

#### The Complete Benefit Table

| Category | Annual Benefit | Notes |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| Peace Dividend | $97B | Redirected military spending |
| R&D Cost Savings | $50B | 82X trial cost reduction |
| **Earlier Access (7 years)** | **$300B** | Timeline acceleration (stock + flow, 10-year avg) |
| New Diseases Treatable | $400B | Rare diseases, orphan drugs |
| Drug Price Reduction | $100B | R&D savings passed to consumers |
| Prevention Medicine | $100B | Economic viability of prevention |
| Mental Health Impact | $75B | Treatment gap reduction |
| | | |
| **ECONOMIC TOTAL** | **$1.122 TRILLION/YEAR** | |

**Economic value (QALY-based):** Already included above using standard $150K/QALY valuation

**ROI:** 1,122:1

**Note:** Insurance savings, productivity gains, and longevity extension are outcomes of the above benefits and not counted separately to avoid double-counting.

#### Why This Makes Sense

The 1% Treaty doesn't just make trials cheaper. It:

1. Restructures global resource allocation (peace dividend: $97B)
2. Slashes R&D costs 82X (saves $50B)
3. **Accelerates access by 7 years** (saves $300B via early trial access)
4. Enables treatment of rare/orphan diseases (adds $400B)
5. Reduces drug prices via R&D savings (saves $100B)
6. Makes prevention economically viable (saves $100B)
7. Addresses mental health treatment gap (adds $75B)
8. Creates compounding innovation effects (not separately valued to avoid double-counting)

Each of these alone is worth tens to hundreds of billions. Together? $1.12 trillion/year.

#### The Sanity Check

**Is $1.12 trillion/year reasonable?**

Global GDP: $111 trillion/year
Global healthcare spending: $9.8 trillion/year
Global military spending: $2.7 trillion/year

If the 1% Treaty generates $1.12T/year in benefits, that's:
- 1.0% of global GDP
- 11.4% of healthcare spending
- 41% of military spending

**This passes the smell test.**

For comparison:
- Eliminating all cancer: ~$1.1T/year economic value
- Curing all infectious disease: ~$800B/year
- Fixing mental health: ~$300B/year

The 1% Treaty doesn't cure everything, but it accelerates access across ALL diseases by 7 years through early trial participation. $1.12T/year is reasonable for that scope.

## Addition to Part VI: Comparison to EA Interventions

### New Section: "Is This Quantifiably Better Than Saving Kids From Malaria?"

**The brutal honesty version.**

#### Standard EA Top Interventions

**Malaria nets:** $3,500 per life saved (Against Malaria Foundation)
**Deworming:** $5,500 per life saved  
**Cash transfers:** $1,000-2,000 per major improvement

**Success probability:** ~100% (proven by RCTs)

#### The 1% Treaty Numbers

**Investment:** $1B (to bootstrap the campaign)
**Annual lives saved:** 25,000/year minimum, growing to 180,000/year as system scales
**Economic value:** $1.12T/year (corrected estimate)

**Cost per life saved:**
- Year 1: $1B ÷ 25,000 = $40,000 per life
- 10-year average: $1B ÷ 1,000,000 = $1,000 per life
- But society PROFITS $1.12T/year while saving lives ($1.12M profit per life saved)

**Success probability:** 5-15% (requires global treaty coordination)

#### Expected Value Math

**Malaria nets (The Sure Thing):**
- Investment: $1B
- Lives saved: 285,714 (nearly certain)
- Economic value: 285,714 lives × $150K/QALY × 35 years = $1.5T
- Expected value: ~$1.5T (nearly certain)

**1% Treaty (The Moonshot):**
- Investment: $1B
- If it succeeds (10% probability): $1.12T/year × 10 years = $11.2T
- Expected value: 10% × $11.2T = **$1.12 trillion**

**Expected value comparison:**
- Malaria nets: $1.5T (100% probability) = $1.5T expected
- 1% Treaty: $11.2T (10% probability) = $1.12T expected

**At 10% success probability, they're roughly equivalent in expected value.**

**But if you believe success probability is >13.4%, the treaty dominates.**

#### The Break-Even Question

**What success probability makes the treaty equal to malaria nets?**

Malaria nets: $1B → $1.5T value (certain)
1% Treaty: $1B → $11.2T value (if successful)

Break-even probability: $1.5T ÷ $11.2T = **13.4%**

**Translation:** If you believe there's even a 13.4% chance the treaty succeeds, it's better than malaria nets in expected value.

**On lives saved alone:**
- Malaria nets: 285,714 lives (certain)
- 1% Treaty: 1,000,000 lives over 10 years (if successful)
- Break-even: 28.6% success probability

**Most optimistic interpretation:** If you think success probability is 15-30%, this dominates malaria nets.

#### The Portfolio Theory Answer

**If you're deploying $10B+ annually:**

Allocate:
- 80% to proven interventions (malaria nets, cash transfers)
- 10% to promising scale-ups
- 10% to moonshots (systemic change like 1% Treaty)

**Current EA allocation to "restructure global military spending": ~0%**

That seems like a mistake.

#### The Uncomfortable Question

**Why isn't EA funding this?**

Possible answers:
1. Too political (EA tries to stay "non-political")
2. Too uncertain (they prefer RCTs)
3. Too ambitious (seems unrealistic)
4. Cultural bias (rewards measurable progress, not system-change bets)
5. Maybe they calculated <1% success probability

**But here's the thing:** If you really care about expected value maximization, and the 1% Treaty has even a 10-15% chance of redirecting $27B/year forever, creating 82X cheaper trials, generating $1.12T/year in benefits...

**By EA's own criteria, this should be funded.**

The fact that it isn't suggests EA has methodological bias toward:
1. Measurable certainty over uncertain but large upside
2. Apolitical interventions over political ones
3. Direct action over systemic change

#### The Bottom Line

**For normal donors ($10K-100K):** Give to GiveWell. Don't bet your charitable budget on moonshots.

**For billionaires ($100M-1B):** Yes, probably. GiveWell can't absorb $1B efficiently anyway. You need systemic change at that scale.

**For EA movement as a whole:** Should allocate 10% to this. Currently allocates 0%. Probably a mistake.

## NEW SECTION for Part VIII: The Strategy

### Why Has Nobody Done This? (The Most Important Question)

If this is worth $1.12 trillion/year in economic value with 1,122:1 ROI, why isn't every billionaire, government, and EA organization already doing it?

This is the core paradox. Let me work through the possibilities seriously.

#### Hypothesis 1: The Math Is Wrong (30% probability)

**Where the calculation might be off:**

**The "Diseases Might Be Fundamentally Harder" Assumption**

Some diseases might be limited by biology, not funding or trial efficiency:

- Cancer might be fundamentally incurable (it's cellular evolution against every drug)
- Aging might be thermodynamically impossible to reverse
- Some conditions might require scientific breakthroughs we can't accelerate with money

**If only 40% of diseases benefit from earlier access:**
- $1.12T drops to $450B
- Still 450:1 ROI, but less dramatic

**The 82X Cost Reduction Might Not Scale**

Oxford RECOVERY achieved 82X in ideal conditions:
- Repurposing existing drug (no safety trials needed)
- UK socialized healthcare (easy recruitment)
- COVID emergency (reduced bureaucracy)
- Simple endpoints (death in 28 days)

**For novel drugs with complex endpoints:** Realistic reduction might be 10-25X, not 82X.

**Conservative estimate:** Even if benefits are only $450B-700B instead of $1.12T, that's still 450-700:1 ROI.

#### Hypothesis 2: The Politics Are Impossible (25% probability)

**Why 190 nations won't sign:**

**The Collective Action Problem**
- If I cut 1% and others don't: I'm weaker (lose/lose)
- If others cut and I don't: I gain advantage (tempting!)
- Free rider problem is massive

**Historical precedent:**
- Landmine treaty: 164 signed, but US/Russia/China didn't
- Paris Climate: Everyone "committed," few cut emissions  
- Nuclear non-proliferation: Constantly violated

**The top 100 defense contractors make over $600B/year**

This is their portion of the $2.7T in total global military spending. They will spend a fraction of that to protect all of it.

Your strategy: Offer them VICTORY bonds with 270% returns

Their counter: Fund politicians who oppose treaty
- Cost to them: $10B
- Cheaper than losing $2.7T

**The spending war:**
- You: $1B over 36 months
- Them: $600B+ in annual revenue
- They can outspend you 2,700:1

You can't win a spending war against Lockheed Martin.

#### Hypothesis 3: Nobody Has The Right Combination (15% probability)

**To pull this off, you need:**

✅ Technical knowledge (understand Oxford trial model)
✅ Economics training (calculate ROI, incentives)
✅ Political sophistication (lobbying, treaties)
✅ Billionaire access (raise $1B)
✅ Credibility (people take you seriously)
✅ Insanity (believe it's possible)

**Most people have 1-2 of these, not all 6.**

Academics: Knowledge, no political skills
Politicians: Access, no technical knowledge  
EAs: Economics, too risk-averse
Billionaires: Money, think politics is beneath them

**That's a VERY small set of people.**

#### Hypothesis 4: Epistemic Learned Helplessness (20% probability)

**Smart people assume:** "If this $20 trillion opportunity existed, someone would have done it already."

**This is usually correct!** Markets are efficient.

**But there are exceptions:**

Examples of "$X trillion bills lying on the ground":
- **Carbon pricing:** Obviously correct, politically impossible
- **Land value tax:** Proven in 1879, still not implemented
- **Open borders:** $78T in gains, politically impossible
- **Prediction markets:** Better than experts, mostly illegal

**Pattern:** When an idea requires:
- Global coordination AND
- Overcoming entrenched interests AND
- Long time horizons AND  
- Tolerating visible short-term costs

**It doesn't happen, even if it's worth trillions.**

#### Hypothesis 5: It's Actually Impossible (10% probability)

Maybe this is like:

**"Why don't we just solve hunger?"**
- We have enough food
- Distribution is the problem
- Politics prevents solution
- Nobody can actually do it

**Or: "Why don't we colonize Mars?"**
- Technology exists
- Economics don't work
- Coordination too hard
- Political will absent

Maybe the 1% Treaty is in this category: Obviously good, probably possible, actually impossible due to politics.

#### The Real Answer (Probability-Weighted)

**Probability-weighted assessment:**

**30%** - Math is wrong (benefits might be $450B-700B instead of $1.12T)
**25%** - Politics are impossible (can't beat defense lobby spending war)
**20%** - Coordination failure (190 nations won't cooperate on 1% cut)
**15%** - Nobody with right combination of skills + credibility + capital has tried yet
**10%** - It's being worked on quietly and we don't know about it

**Note:** These aren't mutually exclusive. Think of these as "primary blocker" assessments.

#### But Here's The Thing...

**Even if I'm 50% wrong about the benefits:**

$1.12T × 50% = $560B/year

**Still 560:1 ROI on $1B investment.**

**Even if probability of success is only 10%:**

10% × $1.12T/year × 10 years = $1.12T expected value

**That's 1.12:1 expected value ROI.**

**At 15% success probability: 1.68:1 expected ROI.**

**Which is still competitive with proven EA interventions, with potential for vastly larger scale.**

#### The Falsification Test

Here's how to test if this is real:

**Step 1:** Build referendum app (2 weeks, $15K)
- Test: Can you get 10,000 votes in 30 days?
- If no: Idea is dead
- If yes: Continue

**Step 2:** Write full thesis (1 month, $50K)
- Test: Do 50 smart people say "this could work"?
- If no: Math is wrong
- If yes: Continue

**Step 3:** Pitch 20 angels for $500K (2 months)
- Test: Can you get 4 to commit?
- If no: Smart money thinks it won't work
- If yes: Continue

**Step 4:** Get to 1M votes (6 months, $200K)
- Test: Does referendum go viral?
- If no: Can't scale to 280M
- If yes: You might actually have something

**Total cost to test:** $265K and 9 months

If it fails: You learned something
If it works: Raise the $10M Series A

#### My Actual Belief

**Benefits estimate:** $1.12T/year (corrected calculation, 10-year horizon = $11.2T total)

**Success probability:** 10-15% (optimistic but not crazy)

**Expected value:**
- At 10%: $1.12T
- At 15%: $1.68T

**On a $1B investment:** 1.12-1.68:1 expected value ROI

**This is competitive with GiveWell top charities** (which have ~1.5-2:1 expected ROI when accounting for execution risk), **but with 1000X larger potential scale.**

**The reason nobody has done it:** Not because it's impossible, but because it requires someone who:
- Understands the full scope
- Believes it's possible despite low odds
- Has access to capital
- Is willing to spend 10 years on it
- Doesn't care about looking crazy

**That's a VERY small set of people.**

**Maybe you're in it.**

**Your job:** Test the thesis cheaply, fast, and publicly. Let the market tell you if this is real.

### Open Borders Economic Analysis

**$78 trillion economic gains estimate:**
> "Michael Clemens, an economist at the Center for Global Development, has argued that 'the tightly binding constraints on emigration from poor countries' may be 'the greatest single class of distortions in the global economy,' with gains from eliminating migration barriers amounting to 'large fractions of world GDP—one or two orders of magnitude larger than the gains from dropping all remaining restrictions on international flows of goods and capital.'...
