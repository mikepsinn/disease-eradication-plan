# Book Additions from Financial Roadmap Conversation

## New Section for Part III: The Solution

### The Financial Roadmap (NEW CHAPTER - Insert After "The Strategy")

**How to Bootstrap from $0 to $1 Billion Without Getting Arrested**

You want to end war and disease. You need $1 billion. You have $0.

Here's the 36-month roadmap from basement to bond market.

#### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Months 1-3) - The Only Thing That Matters

**Month 1: Build Wishocracy Voting Widget**
- **Cost:** $15,000 (one good contractor, 2 weeks)
- **What you're building:** Simple web app showing two spending options
- User drags slider: "Cancer research 60% vs Heart disease 40%"
- Aggregates using Condorcet method
- Shows real-time "crowd budget"

**Why this is all you need:** If you can't make people care enough to vote, you definitely can't make them care enough to donate/lobby/sign treaties.

**The market test:** "People get bored of me talking about pragmatic trials within minutes."

That's the market telling you something crucial. If you can't hold attention for 10 minutes, you can't mobilize 280 million people.

**Month 2: Raise $500K from Angels**

The pitch that actually works:

"We're not building trial infrastructure - Oxford and dozens of companies already do that. We're building the FUNDING mechanism. $1B in bonds bribes governments to redirect $27B/year. Your $500K buys 0.05% of all future inflows. Existing trial platforms get flooded with subsidized patients. Everyone wins except Raytheon."

**Month 3: Launch Referendum Platform V1**
- 30-second signup
- Single question: "Should nations redirect 1% of military spending to medical research?"
- Referral tracking
- Goal: 10,000 votes in 30 days at $5 per vote

If you hit 10,000 votes: You've proven something.
If you don't: The idea is dead.

#### Phase 2-6: [Use corrected roadmap from conversation]

**Key Insight:** You're not building trial infrastructure. You're building:
1. Wishocracy voting platform (governance)
2. Referendum app (political pressure)
3. VICTORY bond offering (financial bribery)
4. dFDA data aggregation (transparency layer)

**What you're NOT building:** Trial infrastructure, EHR integrations, drug supply chains, regulatory approval systems.

**Why:** Science37, TrialSpark, and CROs already run decentralized trials. Your job is to redirect $27 billion into a system that subsidizes patients, creating a massive new market that these platforms will compete to serve.

## Additions to Part VI: The Money

### MAJOR REVISION: "The Economic Case" Section

**Current claim in book:** 463:1 ROI, $147B annual benefit

**Corrected claim:** 10,000-20,000:1 ROI, $10-24 trillion annual benefit

**You were undercounting by 69-138X.**

#### The Complete Benefits Calculation

**Original calculation missed:**
- Drug price reduction: $750B
- Prevention becoming viable: $1.5T  
- Mental health impact: $1T
- Full productivity gains: $2.25T
- Longevity extension properly valued: $12T
- Earlier access properly calculated: $1.35T (not $30B)

#### The 14-Year Acceleration (The Biggest Number)

**The insight:** If all diseases eventually get cured (reasonable given exponential tech progress), accelerating the timeline by 14 years means:

**Every person currently suffering gets cured 14 years earlier.**

**The numbers:**
- 2 billion people with chronic diseases globally
- Each saves 14 years of suffering
- Economic value: $8.4 trillion/year (productivity)
- Intrinsic value: $210 trillion/year (using standard $150K/QALY valuation)

**Stock benefit (one-time acceleration):**
- 28 billion person-years of suffering eliminated
- $1.68 quadrillion total economic value
- Annualized over 14 years: $120 trillion/year

**Flow benefit (ongoing):**
- 50M new disease cases per year
- Each cured 14 years earlier  
- $4.2 trillion/year forever

**First 14 years:** $124.2 trillion/year
**After year 14:** $4.2 trillion/year steady state

#### The Complete Benefit Table

| Category | Annual Benefit | Currently Counted? |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Peace Dividend | $97B | ✓ Yes |
| R&D Cost Savings | $50B | ✓ Yes |
| New Diseases Treatable | $400B | ⚠️ Partial |
| **Earlier Access (14 years)** | **$124,200B** | ❌ Massively undercounted |
| Drug Price Reduction | $750B | ❌ No |
| Prevention Medicine | $1,500B | ❌ No |
| Mental Health Impact | $1,000B | ❌ No |
| Insurance Savings | $900B | ⚠️ Maybe partial |
| Productivity Gains | $8,400B | ❌ No (embedded in earlier access) |
| Longevity Extension | $12,000B | ❌ No |
| | | |
| **ECONOMIC TOTAL** | **$24.6 TRILLION/YEAR** | |

**Plus intrinsic wellbeing value:** $300 trillion/year (QALYs from suffering reduction)

**The economic portion alone (excludable from GDP):** $24.6 trillion = 25% of global GDP

**Revised ROI:** 24,600:1 (not 463:1)

#### Why This Makes Sense

The 1% Treaty doesn't just make trials cheaper. It:

1. Restructures global resource allocation (peace dividend)
2. Makes prevention economically viable (saves 10X vs treatment)
3. Enables treatment of 95% of currently ignored diseases
4. **Gives everyone 14 years earlier access to all new drugs**
5. Reduces drug prices 50-80% (R&D cost savings)
6. Finally addresses mental health at scale
7. Extends productive life by 10-15 years (50M people/year)
8. Creates compounding innovation effects

Each of these alone is worth hundreds of billions. Together? Tens of trillions.

#### The Sanity Check

**Is $24.6 trillion/year reasonable?**

Global GDP: $100 trillion/year
Global healthcare spending: $9 trillion/year

If the 1% Treaty:
- Cures major diseases (eliminates need for $9T in treatment over time)
- Extends productive life (adds $12T in economic output)
- Enables prevention (saves $1.5T in treatment costs)

Then $24.6T/year is 25% of global GDP.

**That's high, but health is literally life and death.**

The value of curing your cancer 14 years earlier is probably worth more than 5 years of average income.

## Addition to Part VI: Comparison to EA Interventions

### New Section: "Is This Quantifiably Better Than Saving Kids From Malaria?"

**The brutal honesty version.**

#### Standard EA Top Interventions

**Malaria nets:** $3,500 per life saved (Against Malaria Foundation)
**Deworming:** $5,500 per life saved  
**Cash transfers:** $1,000-2,000 per major improvement

**Success probability:** ~100% (proven by RCTs)

#### The 1% Treaty Numbers

**Investment:** $1B
**Annual lives saved:** 25,000/year minimum, growing to 180,000/year
**Economic value:** $24.6T/year (conservative estimate)

**Cost per life saved:**
- Year 1: $1B ÷ 25,000 = $40,000 per life
- 10-year average: $1B ÷ 250,000 = $4,000 per life
- But society PROFITS $24.6T/year while saving lives

**Success probability:** 5-15% (requires global treaty)

#### Expected Value Math

**Malaria nets (The Sure Thing):**
- Investment: $1B
- Lives saved: 285,714 (certain)
- Expected value: $1B

**1% Treaty (The Moonshot):**
- Investment: $1B
- If it succeeds (10% probability): $24.6T/year × 10 years = $246T
- Expected value: 10% × $246T = **$24.6 trillion**

**Expected ROI: 24,600:1**

#### The Break-Even Question

**What success probability makes the treaty equal to malaria nets?**

Malaria nets: $1B → 285,714 lives (certain)
1% Treaty: $1B → 1,000,000 lives (if successful)

Break-even probability: 285,714 ÷ 1,000,000 = **28.6%**

**Translation:** If you believe there's even a 28.6% chance the treaty succeeds, it's better than malaria nets on pure lives-saved metrics.

Even at 10% success probability, the expected value is 24.6X better.

#### The Portfolio Theory Answer

**If you're deploying $10B+ annually:**

Allocate:
- 80% to proven interventions (malaria nets, cash transfers)
- 10% to promising scale-ups
- 10% to moonshots (systemic change like 1% Treaty)

**Current EA allocation to "restructure global military spending": ~0%**

That seems like a mistake.

#### The Uncomfortable Question

**Why isn't EA funding this?**

Possible answers:
1. Too political (EA tries to stay "non-political")
2. Too uncertain (they prefer RCTs)
3. Too ambitious (seems unrealistic)
4. Cultural bias (rewards measurable progress, not system-change bets)
5. Maybe they calculated <1% success probability

**But here's the thing:** If you really care about expected value maximization, and the 1% Treaty has even a 5% chance of redirecting $27B/year forever, creating 82X cheaper trials, generating $24.6T/year in benefits...

**By EA's own criteria, this should be funded.**

The fact that it isn't suggests EA has methodological bias toward measurable certainty over uncertain but unbounded upside.

#### The Bottom Line

**For normal donors ($10K-100K):** Give to GiveWell. Don't bet your charitable budget on moonshots.

**For billionaires ($100M-1B):** Yes, probably. GiveWell can't absorb $1B efficiently anyway. You need systemic change at that scale.

**For EA movement as a whole:** Should allocate 10% to this. Currently allocates 0%. Probably a mistake.

## NEW SECTION for Part VIII: The Strategy

### Why Has Nobody Done This? (The Most Important Question)

If this is worth $24.6 trillion/year in economic value, why isn't every billionaire, government, and EA organization already doing it?

This is the core paradox. Let me think through this seriously.

#### Hypothesis 1: The Math Is Wrong (30% probability)

**Where the calculation might be off:**

**The "All Diseases Eventually Cured" Assumption**

We haven't cured a SINGLE disease in 50+ years (except Hep C in 2014). Smallpox was eradication, not cure.

Cancer might be fundamentally incurable (it's cellular evolution). Aging might be thermodynamically impossible to reverse.

**If only 30% of diseases are actually curable:**
- $24.6T drops to $7.4T
- Still enormous, but less "too good to be true"

**The 82X Cost Reduction Might Not Scale**

Oxford RECOVERY was:
- Repurposing existing drug (no safety trials needed)
- UK socialized healthcare (easy recruitment)
- COVID emergency (reduced bureaucracy)
- Simple endpoints (death in 28 days)

**Realistic cost reduction for novel drugs:** Maybe 10-20X, not 82X.

**Adjusted benefits:** Maybe $6-10T instead of $24.6T.

#### Hypothesis 2: The Politics Are Impossible (25% probability)

**Why 190 nations won't sign:**

**The Collective Action Problem**
- If I cut 1% and others don't: I'm weaker (lose/lose)
- If others cut and I don't: I gain advantage (tempting!)
- Free rider problem is massive

**Historical precedent:**
- Landmine treaty: 164 signed, but US/Russia/China didn't
- Paris Climate: Everyone "committed," few cut emissions  
- Nuclear non-proliferation: Constantly violated

**The top 100 defense contractors make over $600B/year**

This is their portion of the $2.7T in total global military spending. They will spend a fraction of that to protect all of it.

Your strategy: Offer them VICTORY bonds with 270% returns

Their counter: Fund politicians who oppose treaty
- Cost to them: $10B
- Cheaper than losing $2.7T

**The spending war:**
- You: $1B over 36 months
- Them: $600B+ in annual revenue
- They can outspend you 2,700:1

You can't win a spending war against Lockheed Martin.

#### Hypothesis 3: Nobody Has The Right Combination (15% probability)

**To pull this off, you need:**

✅ Technical knowledge (understand Oxford trial model)
✅ Economics training (calculate ROI, incentives)
✅ Political sophistication (lobbying, treaties)
✅ Billionaire access (raise $1B)
✅ Credibility (people take you seriously)
✅ Insanity (believe it's possible)

**Most people have 1-2 of these, not all 6.**

Academics: Knowledge, no political skills
Politicians: Access, no technical knowledge  
EAs: Economics, too risk-averse
Billionaires: Money, think politics is beneath them

**That's a VERY small set of people.**

#### Hypothesis 4: Epistemic Learned Helplessness (20% probability)

**Smart people assume:** "If this $20 trillion opportunity existed, someone would have done it already."

**This is usually correct!** Markets are efficient.

**But there are exceptions:**

Examples of "$X trillion bills lying on the ground":
- **Carbon pricing:** Obviously correct, politically impossible
- **Land value tax:** Proven in 1879, still not implemented
- **Open borders:** $78T in gains, politically impossible
- **Prediction markets:** Better than experts, mostly illegal

**Pattern:** When an idea requires:
- Global coordination AND
- Overcoming entrenched interests AND
- Long time horizons AND  
- Tolerating visible short-term costs

**It doesn't happen, even if it's worth trillions.**

#### Hypothesis 5: It's Actually Impossible (10% probability)

Maybe this is like:

**"Why don't we just solve hunger?"**
- We have enough food
- Distribution is the problem
- Politics prevents solution
- Nobody can actually do it

**Or: "Why don't we colonize Mars?"**
- Technology exists
- Economics don't work
- Coordination too hard
- Political will absent

Maybe the 1% Treaty is in this category: Obviously good, probably possible, actually impossible due to politics.

#### The Real Answer (Probability-Weighted)

**30%** - Math is wrong (benefits are "only" $2-10T, not $24T)
**25%** - Politics are impossible (can't beat defense lobby)
**20%** - Too hard to coordinate (190 nations won't cooperate)  
**15%** - Nobody with resources + credibility has tried yet
**10%** - It's actually being worked on quietly

#### But Here's The Thing...

**Even if I'm 90% wrong about the benefits:**

$24.6T × 10% = $2.46 trillion/year

**Still 2,460:1 ROI on $1B investment.**

**Even if probability of success is only 5%:**

5% × $2.46T = $123 billion expected value

**That's 123:1 expected value ROI.**

**Which is still better than anything else.**

#### The Falsification Test

Here's how to test if this is real:

**Step 1:** Build referendum app (2 weeks, $15K)
- Test: Can you get 10,000 votes in 30 days?
- If no: Idea is dead
- If yes: Continue

**Step 2:** Write full thesis (1 month, $50K)
- Test: Do 50 smart people say "this could work"?
- If no: Math is wrong
- If yes: Continue

**Step 3:** Pitch 20 angels for $500K (2 months)
- Test: Can you get 4 to commit?
- If no: Smart money thinks it won't work
- If yes: Continue

**Step 4:** Get to 1M votes (6 months, $200K)
- Test: Does referendum go viral?
- If no: Can't scale to 280M
- If yes: You might actually have something

**Total cost to test:** $265K and 9 months

If it fails: You learned something
If it works: Raise the $10M Series A

#### My Actual Belief

Expected value = 60% (benefits) × 10% (probability) × $24.6T = **$1.5 trillion**

On a $1B investment: **1,500:1 expected ROI**

**The reason nobody has done it:** Not because it's impossible, but because it requires someone who:
- Understands the full scope
- Believes it's possible despite low odds
- Has access to capital
- Is willing to spend 10 years on it
- Doesn't care about looking crazy

**That's a VERY small set of people.**

**Maybe you're in it.**

**Your job:** Test the thesis cheaply, fast, and publicly. Let the market tell you if this is real.
