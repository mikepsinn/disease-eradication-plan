# War on Disease - Website Visual Journey Design

## Overview
A scrollytelling website that reveals humanity's insane spending priorities through three escalating shocks:
1. We spend 40X more on weapons than cures
2. War actually costs 4X more than admitted ($9.7T not $2.7T)
3. Disease burden is 10X bigger than war ($109T)

Then offers the 1% Treaty as a simple solution: redirect just 1% of military spending to cure diseases using systems proven to be 82X more efficient.

## The Three Shocks (Building to Maximum Horror)

### Scene 1: "The Murder Budget vs The Cure Budget"

**Visual Design:**
- Full-screen comparison with two columns
- War column breaks through the top of screen, requires scrolling
- Medical research column barely visible at bottom
- Nuclear missiles and skulls raining down the war column
- Tiny medicine pills trickling down the research column

**Data Visualization:**
```
💣 MILITARY SPENDING: $2,700,000,000,000/year [MASSIVE RED COLUMN - breaks screen]
   What this buys:
   - 13,000 nuclear warheads (ending civilization 67 times)
   - AI autonomous weapons development (Skynet in progress)
   - Hypersonic missiles that can't be stopped
   - Space weapons programs
   - Cyber warfare capabilities
   - Enough firepower to kill everyone 535 times

💊 MEDICAL RESEARCH: $68,000,000,000/year [TINY GREEN BAR - 2.5% height]
   What this buys:
   - Your kid's rare disease research: $0
   - Alzheimer's cure: Still waiting after 50 years
   - Cancer universal cure: Nope
   - Mental illness cure: Nope
   - Aging reversal: Nope
   - 95% of diseases: ZERO approved treatments

[MASSIVE TEXT]: WE SPEND 40X MORE ON KILLING THAN CURING
```

**Interaction:**
- Counter showing: "Money spent on war while you read this: $[rapidly counting up]"
- Deaths from disease while you read this: [counting up]
- Click war column: Shows specific weapon systems and costs
- Click medical column: Shows diseases with zero funding

**The Punchline:**
"But that $2.7 trillion is just what they ADMIT to spending..."
[Keep scrolling to see the REAL cost]

---

### Scene 2: "The REAL Cost of War (The Part They Don't Tell You)"

**Visual Design:**
- Start with the $2.7T military budget already shown
- Hidden costs slide in from sides and stack on top with violent shaking
- Blood-red color scheme darkening with each addition
- Total grows exponentially with each reveal
- Screen cracks appear as number gets bigger

**Cost Breakdown:**
```javascript
What They Admit: $2.7 TRILLION military spending
[Screen shakes, hidden costs appear]

THE COSTS THEY HIDE:
+ Cities Turned to Parking Lots: $2.4T [CRASHES IN FROM LEFT]
+ Veterans With PTSD Forever: $500B [CRASHES IN FROM RIGHT]
+ 70 Million Refugees: $800B [FALLS FROM TOP]  
+ Global Trade Destroyed: $1.5T [SLIDES UP FROM BOTTOM]
+ Dead Innovators & Scientists: $2.0T [EXPLODES IN CENTER]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
= REAL COST OF WAR: $9.7 TRILLION/YEAR

[Counter rapidly updating]
That's $307,000 PER SECOND wasted on destruction
```

**Interaction:**
- Each cost block shows real examples on hover:
  - "Syria: $300B to rebuild"
  - "Ukraine: $400B and counting"
  - "1.2M veterans need lifetime care"
  - "Could have cured cancer 485 times"

**The Reveal:**
"We told you military spending was $2.7 trillion...
We lied. The REAL cost is $9.7 trillion.
But even THAT looks like pocket change compared to..."
[Keep scrolling]

---

### Scene 3: "Plot Twist: Disease Makes War Look Cheap"

**Visual Design:**
- Screen zooms out to show war costs were just a tiny part
- Purple disease blob emerges and DWARFS the war costs
- War's $9.7T shrinks as disease's $109T fills entire screen
- Tentacles reaching out grabbing stick figures
- Counter of real-time deaths prominently displayed

**The Ultimate Horror:**
```
You thought $9.7 TRILLION for war was insane?

MEET THE REAL KILLER:

💀 THE DISEASE BURDEN:
Direct Healthcare Costs: $8.2T [purple blob appears]
+ Lost Human Productivity: $100.9T [EXPLODES to consume screen]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
= THE $109 TRILLION DEATH TOILET

[Visual: War costs shrink to 9% while disease fills 91% of screen]

WAR:     $9.7T  (■■□□□□□□□□) 9%
DISEASE: $109T  (■■■■■■■■■■) 91%

Daily Disease Cost: $298 BILLION
Hourly Disease Cost: $12.4 BILLION  
This Second: $3.4 MILLION [live counter]
People Dying While You Read This: [rapidly counting]
```

**The Three-Layer Revelation Summary:**
1. Military spending: $2.7T (what they admit)
2. True war cost: $9.7T (including destruction)
3. Disease burden: $109T (the real apocalypse)

**Final Punchline:**
"We're so worried about nuclear war killing everyone...
While disease is ACTUALLY killing everyone.
55 million per year. Every year. Forever."

**Transition to Death Clock:**
"Want to see what $109 trillion in suffering looks like?
Let's count the bodies..."
[Scroll down to watch people die in real-time]

## The Death Clock

### Live Death Counter Display

**Visual Design:**
- Large numerical counters that increment based on statistical rates
- Subtle grave icons (⚰️) fade in every 10 deaths in a grid
- Simple "thud" sound every 100 deaths (optional)
- Clean, minimalist design focused on the numbers

**Real-Time Counters (calculated from global averages):**
```
Since you arrived [X seconds] ago:

⚰️ Total deaths from disease: [147 and counting - 3/second]
💀 Preventable deaths: [73 and counting - 1.5/second]
👶 Children under 5: [28 and counting - 0.6/second]
🧠 Mental illness suicides: [3 and counting - 1 per 40 seconds]

[Small grid of graves appears subtly in background]
```

**Personalization:**
- "One of these could be your [randomize: mom/dad/child/friend] - scroll to save them"

## Why They're All Dying (The System Is Broken)

### "We Give Billions to 'Cure Disease' - They Cure Nothing"

**Visual Design:**
- Money flowing into a black hole labeled "NIH"
- Nothing coming out the other side
- Counter showing decades since last disease cured

**The Broken System:**
```
THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH)
America's Medical Research Monopoly

Annual Budget: $48 BILLION
Diseases Eradicated in Last 50 Years: ZERO
Time to Develop One Drug: 17 YEARS  
Cost Per New Drug: $2.6 BILLION
Patients Excluded From Trials: 85%

"We gave them $1.6 billion for COVID research.
They completed ZERO trials in 4 years."
```

**The NIH's Greatest Hits:**
- Spent $3M to study why lesbians are fat (conclusion: unclear)
- Spent $2.6M watching hamsters fight on steroids
- Spent $1.5M studying wine and cheese pairings (in France!)
- Spent $856K training mountain lions to run on treadmills
- But your kid's rare disease? "Sorry, no funding available"

**How NIH Scientists Spend Their Time:**
- 60% - Writing grant proposals
- 30% - Reviewing other people's grant proposals  
- 9% - Meetings about grant proposals
- 1% - Actual science

**The Problem Explained:**
- "200 bureaucrats in Maryland decide what gets researched"
- "90% of grant applications rejected"
- "Scientists spend 60% of time writing grants, 40% doing science"
- "Negative results never published (half of all research hidden)"

---

## The Solution Already Exists

### "Meanwhile, Oxford Just Showed Everyone How to Actually Save Lives"

**Visual Design:**
- Split screen with money burning on left, lives saved on right
- Stark contrast: Red (failure) vs Green (success)
- Animation showing the difference in approach

**The Comparison That Changes Everything:**
```
CENTRALIZED (NIH)           |  DECENTRALIZED (Oxford)
-----------------------------|---------------------------
💰 $1.6 BILLION spent       |  💰 $10 million spent
🔬 0 treatments found       |  🔬 7 treatments found  
⏰ 4 years wasted          |  ⏰ 6 months to results
💸 $41,000 per patient     |  💸 $500 per patient
☠️ 0 lives saved           |  ❤️ 1 MILLION lives saved
🏢 Run by 200 bureaucrats   |  👩‍⚕️ Run by actual doctors
📝 85% excluded from trials |  ✅ Everyone can participate

[Animated money burning]    |  [Lives being saved animation]
```

**What Oxford Did Differently:**
- "They let DOCTORS run trials, not bureaucrats"
- "They included REAL sick people, not just healthy volunteers"  
- "They used EXISTING hospital systems, not special trial centers"
- "They tested MULTIPLE treatments simultaneously"
- "They published ALL results immediately, even failures"

**The Secret Sauce Oxford Used:**
- No FDA paperwork orgies (just simple forms)
- Used WhatsApp to coordinate (not $100M software)
- Tested old cheap drugs (not new $1M molecules)
- Included dying people (FDA trials exclude the sickest)
- Published failures immediately (pharma usually buries them)
- Cost: One Pentagon toilet seat
- Lives saved: One million

**Translation:** "A few doctors with WhatsApp beat the entire US medical establishment"

**The Key Insight:**
"Decentralized trials are 82X more efficient than centralized bureaucracy.
The solution exists. We're just not using it."

---

## Scaling the Solution Globally: The dFDA

### Taking Oxford's Breakthrough to 8 Billion People

**Visual Design:**
- Split screen: Oxford (UK only) → dFDA (global)
- Data flowing from millions of sources into effectiveness rankings
- NOT Amazon reviews - algorithmic analysis visualization

**What the dFDA Does:**
```
Takes Oxford's 82X efficiency and makes it:
✅ GLOBAL - Every human can participate
✅ UNIVERSAL - Every treatment gets tested
✅ CONTINUOUS - Real-time effectiveness tracking
✅ TRANSPARENT - All data public (anonymized)
✅ UNCAPTURABLE - No single approval authority
```

### Treatment Effectiveness Rankings (Not Reviews - Data)

**Visual Design:**
- Show data sources flowing into rankings
- Causal inference algorithms analyzing patterns
- Individual experiences aggregating into population insights

```
🔍 Search: "Type 2 Diabetes"

EFFECTIVENESS RANKINGS (Based on 1.2M patient outcomes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
#1. METFORMIN + LIFESTYLE CHANGE
Effectiveness: 73% | Data points: 487,293 patients
Causal confidence: HIGH (randomized trials + real world data)

Effectiveness: 12% | Data points: 892,734 patients
Causal confidence: HIGH (decades of data)
Warning: Weight gain in 67% of users
[WHY THIS FAILS] [SEE BETTER OPTIONS]
```

**How Rankings Are Created:**
- **NOT user reviews** (Amazon's weakness)
- **Causal inference on time-series data** (what actually caused improvement)
- **N-of-1 analysis** (each person is their own control)
- **Aggregated across millions** (wisdom of crowds, but with data)
- **Continuously updated** (gets smarter every day)

### Outcome Labels: The Truth About Everything

**Visual Design:**
- Foods and drugs with data-driven labels
- Positive and negative effects quantified
- Personalized based on your biology

```
OUTCOME LABELS (Not marketing claims - actual effects)

🥤 COCA-COLA (Based on 2.3M consumer records)
Positive: Energy +15% for 1 hour
Negative: Diabetes risk +23%, Tooth decay +34%, Addiction 12%
Net health impact: -8.7 QALYs over lifetime
[See alternatives with positive impact]

💊 STATINS (Based on 47M patient records)  
Positive: Heart attack risk -29%, Stroke -24%
Negative: Muscle pain 18%, Diabetes +9%, Memory issues 4%
Net for your profile: +2.3 QALYs
[Personalized risk/benefit analysis]
```

**The Data Revolution:**
- Every treatment outcome tracked
- Every side effect quantified  
- Every food's health impact measured
- Updated every second as new data arrives
- No hiding negative results (everything public)

---

## The 1% Treaty

### The International Agreement to End Stupidity

**Visual Design:**
- Treaty document with nation flags around it
- Signatures appearing as countries join
- Counter showing total redirected funds growing

**What Is The 1% Treaty?**
```
AN INTERNATIONAL AGREEMENT WHERE EVERY NATION:
- Reduces military spending by 1%
- Redirects that 1% to medical research
- All countries do it simultaneously (no one loses military advantage)
- Creates $27 BILLION annual fund for curing disease

NOT A CHARITY. NOT A TAX. JUST 1% LESS STUPIDITY.
```

### Interactive Budget Reallocation Slider

**Visual Design:**
- Slider from 0% to 10% military budget reduction
- Real-time visualization of impact as user drags
- Graves disappear, diseases get crossed out, costs shrink

**At 1% Setting:**
```
Military Budget: $2,673 Billion (still 99% for killing)
Health Research: $27 Billion (finally 1% for healing)

Lives Saved Annually: 180,000
Diseases Cured in 10 Years: 20-50
Your Life Extension: +15 years
Cost to You: $0
```

**Visual Feedback:**
- Graveyard shrinks
- Disease monster shrinks
- Green growth overtakes red destruction

**The Magic of Simultaneous Reduction:**
- USA: -1% military = $8B to health
- China: -1% military = $3B to health
- Russia: -1% military = $1B to health
- Every other country: -1% military
- TOTAL: $27B for humanity
- Military balance: UNCHANGED (everyone reduces equally)

## Where the $27 Billion Goes

### The DIH Treasury Structure

**Visual Design:**
- Clean SVG flowchart with animated dotted lines
- Dollar signs slide along paths (simple CSS animation)
- Each component clickable for details
- Subway map aesthetic - simple and clear

```
[🌍 All Countries Sign Treaty] 
    ↓ (1% of military budgets)
[💰 DIH Treasury: $27B/year]
    ↓
[Fund Categories]
    ├─→ 📱 dFDA Platform (5%)
    │   "Global trial infrastructure"
    ├─→ 💊 Patient Subsidies (85%)
    │   "Free trials for everyone"  
    ├─→ 📈 VICTORY Bond Returns (5%)
    │   "Investor rewards"
    └─→ 🔬 Platform Operations (5%)
        "Keep the lights on"
```

**Animation:**
- Dollar signs move along paths continuously
- Subtle glow on hover
- Click for breakdown details

**What Each Category Means:**
- **dFDA Platform:** The Amazon-like marketplace for trials
- **Patient Subsidies:** Covers trial costs so anyone can participate
- **VICTORY Bonds:** Returns to investors who funded treaty passage
- **Operations:** Running costs, servers, staff

**Anti-Corruption Features Built In:**
- "No politicians can redirect these funds"
- "No pharma exec can capture the treasury"
- "Transparent blockchain tracking of every dollar"
- "Smart contracts enforce the allocation"

**But this is just the STRUCTURE...**
"The real question: Within these categories, who decides which specific diseases and trials get funded?"
[Keep scrolling for the answer...]

## The $27 Billion Question: Who Decides?

### The Most Important Question Nobody's Asking

**Visual Design:**
- Three doors with different allocation methods behind them
- Each door opens to show the horror/failure within
- Final door reveals Wishocracy as the solution

**We Have $27 Billion. Now What?**
```
Option A: Politicians Decide
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Result: Money goes to their donors' diseases
Your rare disease: Still ignored
Corruption level: 100%

Option B: Expert Committee Decides (Like NIH)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Result: 200 people guess what matters
90% of diseases: Still no funding
We already showed this fails

Option C: Direct Democracy (Everyone Votes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Problem: 10,000 diseases on one ballot?
Information overload: Nobody can decide
Result: Random chaos

Option D: Something New...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[KEEP SCROLLING TO DISCOVER]
```

**The Core Problem:**
"Every allocation system in history has been captured by special interests. We need something uncapturable."

---

## But Wait, Democracy Is Already Dead

### The Princeton Bombshell Nobody Talks About

**Visual Design:**
- Graph showing flat line at 0% correlation
- Animated money flowing from lobbyists to politicians
- Public opinion vs policy outcomes visualization

**The Study That Proves You Don't Matter:**
```
PRINCETON UNIVERSITY - 20 YEAR STUDY
1,779 Policy Decisions Analyzed

Correlation between what YOU want and what happens: 0%
Correlation between what RICH PEOPLE want and what happens: 78%

Translation: Your vote is theater. Money is the real vote.
```

**Why Any $27 Billion Would Get Stolen:**
```
Traditional Democracy:
- 535 people control the budget
- Each one needs money to get reelected  
- Lobbyists offer that money
- Your $27B → Their pet projects

Committee Allocation:
- 200 NIH bureaucrats failed already (shown earlier)
- Any new committee = same capture
- Special interests always win
- Your diseases stay unfunded
```

**The Problem:**
"You can't allocate $27 billion through representatives or committees without it being stolen by whoever bribes them"

---

## Enter Wishocracy: 8 Billion Allocators

### The Uncapturable System for Spending Treaty Funds

**Visual Design:**
- Show traditional budget (top-down) vs Wishocracy (bottom-up)
- Animated visualization of millions of votes aggregating
- No middlemen between voters and budget

**The Innovation: Direct Allocation Without Representatives**
```
THE TREATY GIVES US $27 BILLION
BUT WHO DECIDES HOW TO SPEND IT?

THE PROBLEM WITH EVERY OTHER SYSTEM:
❌ Representatives = Bribeable (535 people)
❌ Committees = Capturable (200 people)  
❌ Direct Democracy = Overwhelming (10,000 decisions)

✅ WISHOCRACY = UNCAPTURABLE (8 billion deciders)
```

**What Wishocracy Does:**
- NOT about passing the treaty (that's the referendum)
- IS about allocating the $27B once we have it
- Every human gets equal say in how funds are distributed
- No politicians or committees can override

**How It Works:**
1. **Treaty passes → $27B enters DIH Treasury**
2. **You never see a complex budget** - Just simple pairs
3. **Random pairs for each person** - Can't game the system
4. **Slide to allocate** - "Cancer research vs Alzheimer's" [60/40 split]
5. **AI aggregates millions of micro-decisions** - Creates coherent budget
6. **Funds automatically distributed** - No human can override

### Wishocracy Live Demo

**Interactive Demo:**
```
Help Allocate The Treaty's $27 Billion

Which should get more funding?

[Childhood Cancer Research]  ← 30% | 70% →  [Alzheimer's Research]
                          [YOUR ALLOCATION SLIDER]

You'll see 20 random pairs. Takes 3 minutes total.

Live Global Consensus:
🌍 8,924,123 people allocating right now
📊 Current allocation: 44% | 56%
⚡ Your vote updates the global allocation instantly

[NEXT PAIR →]
```

**Why This Can't Be Captured:**
- **No gatekeepers:** Nobody approves/rejects proposals
- **No representatives:** Direct allocation, no middlemen
- **Too many allocators:** Can't bribe 8 billion people
- **Random pairs:** Can't coordinate manipulation
- **Transparent math:** Every calculation public
- **Treaty funds only:** Not your taxes, just the redirected military money

**Key Messages:**
- "The treaty gets the money, Wishocracy decides where it goes"
- "It's like Netflix recommendations but for civilization"
- "You already do this - 'Pizza or Chinese?' - just scaled up"
- "First time in history: Budget allocation without politicians"

## The Investment Opportunity  

### Returns Comparison (Animated Bar Race)

**Visual Design:**
- Bars race over 20-year timeline
- Money counter showing compound growth
- Risk indicators for each investment

```
INVESTMENT VEHICLE          ANNUAL RETURN    YOUR $10K BECOMES

Savings Account               0.5% 😴         $11,000
10-Year Treasury              3.5% 🛡️         $20,000  
S&P 500 Index                10.0% 📈         $67,000
Bitcoin                       ???% 🎰         $0 - $10M
Cocaine Trafficking          300% 🚔         [PRISON]
Defense Contractor Lobbying 1,813% 💀        $181,000 (but evil)

✨ VICTORY BONDS              40% 🚀         $2.9 MILLION
                                             (and you're a hero)
```

**The Pitch:**
"5% of all DIH treasury flows, forever. As treasury grows from 1% → 2% → 10%, your returns scale automatically."

## The Prisoner's Dilemma Solved

### Game Theory Matrix

**Visual Design:**
- Interactive game theory matrix
- Shows how bondholders enforce compliance
- Animated scenarios playing out

```
THE OLD GAME (Everyone Dies):
                    Others Sign Treaty    Others Don't Sign
    You Sign:       Everyone Wins ✅      You Look Weak ❌
    You Don't:      You're the Asshole ❌ Everyone Dies ☠️

THE NEW GAME (With VICTORY Bonds):
    Rich People Own Bonds → Countries Must Comply or Investors Lose Billions
    Result: EVERYONE SIGNS OR BILLIONAIRES DESTROY THEM
```

**The Problem Without Bonds:**
Every country thinks: "If I reduce military spending and others don't, I'm weak"
Result: Nobody reduces, everyone keeps dying

**The Solution With Bonds:**
Billionaires own bonds → They LOSE MONEY if countries cheat
Billionaires control politicians → Politicians obey or get replaced
Result: Treaty passes or rich people destroy whoever blocks it

**Translation:** "We weaponized greed against itself"

12 PM: News: Another $50B for new fighter jets
3 PM: Friend dies of treatable disease (couldn't afford treatment)
6 PM: Take 7 pills that treat symptoms, cure nothing
9 PM: Set alarm to wake up and do it all again tomorrow
Life expectancy: -2 months since yesterday
```

**2050 (With Treaty):**
```
6 AM: AI doctor adjusts your cellular age to 25
9 AM: Grandma's 150th birthday party planning
12 PM: News: Last disease eradicated, scientists "bored"
3 PM: Friend's cancer detected and cured in same appointment
6 PM: Take longevity pill (optional, some people choose mortality for variety)
9 PM: Plan which galaxy to visit next
Life expectancy: "Yes"

## Quick Answers for Skeptics

**Visual Design:**
- FAQ accordion style
- Click to expand each objection
- Responses are short and punchy

**"This is communism!"**
No, it's capitalism where we bet on not dying instead of dying.

**"You can't trust voting masses!"**
We trust them to elect presidents with nukes. This is safer.

**"Big Pharma will block this!"**
Big Pharma MAKES MONEY from this. We're giving them millions of new paying customers.

**"The military-industrial complex won't allow it!"**
They get 99% of their budget PLUS 40% returns on VICTORY bonds. They'll lobby FOR us.

**"This is too good to be true!"**
So was democracy, antibiotics, and the internet. Sometimes good things happen.

**"What if corrupt actors take over?"**
They literally can't. There's no central point to capture. 8 billion people vote directly.

**"Won't countries cheat?"**
Not when their richest citizens lose billions if they do. Money enforces compliance.

- Humor level (darker vs lighter)
- CTA button copy variations  
- Investment returns emphasis
- Fear vs hope messaging balance

## Content Principles

### Voice & Tone
- **Dark humor:** "We're all dying anyway, might as well fix it"
- **Radical honesty:** "Politicians are bribed, here's how we outbribe them"
- **Urgency without panic:** "Your grandma is dying but we can save her"
- **Accessible complexity:** "It's complicated but here's the 5-year-old version"

### Key Messages to Hammer
1. We spend 40X more on weapons (including nuclear & AI) than cures
2. We have 13,000 nukes but zero cures for 95% of diseases
3. We're literally building Skynet while grandma dies of Alzheimer's
4. Oxford already proved we can be 82X more efficient
5. Just 1% of military budget = 20-50 diseases cured

### What to Avoid
- Partisan politics (both sides are bribed)
- Country-specific blame (every country does this)
- Technical jargon (keep it simple)
- Optimism without evidence (show the proof)
- Asking for donations (this is an investment)

## Notes

This design document is for internal use. Remember:
- We're not asking for donations, we're offering investments
- We're not fighting the system, we're bribing it better  
- We're not idealists, we're pragmatists with dark humor
- We're not promising utopia, we're promising 1% less stupidity

**The One-Line Pitch:**
"Humanity has 13,000 nukes and is building Skynet while 55 million die annually from diseases we could cure with 1% of the military budget."

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Message (Week 1)
Build these first - they carry 80% of the impact:
1. **The spending comparison chart** (Spending Insanity section)
2. **The death counter** (Death Clock section) 
3. **NIH vs Oxford comparison** (Why They're Dying + Solution Exists sections)
4. **The 1% budget slider** (1% Solution section)
5. **Call to action buttons** (Call to Action section)

### Phase 2: Engagement Features (Week 2)
Add interactivity:
1. **dFDA mockup interface** (Amazon for Not Dying section)
2. **Wishocracy voting demo** (Democracy That Works section)
3. **Investment returns comparison** (Investment Opportunity section)

### Phase 3: Polish (Week 3)
Nice-to-haves:
1. **Timeline comparison** (Choose Your Future section)
2. **Sound effects** (optional throughout)
3. **Share widgets and social features**
4. **A/B testing infrastructure**

### Future Additions (Once Live with Real Data):
- **Live social proof counter** (viewing now, votes today, etc.)
- **Real-time government position tracker**
- **Actual death counter** (connected to WHO data)
- **Live investment thermometer**

### What NOT to Build:
- Physics engines
- 3D animations  
- Complex particle systems
- Real-time WebSocket connections
- Elaborate transitions

**Remember:** The data tells the story, not the animations. A simple counter showing preventable deaths is more powerful than any special effect.
