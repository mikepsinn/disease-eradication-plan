# CURE DISEASES<br>82X FASTER

## THE PROBLEM

::::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### 55M DEATHS/YEAR

People die from treatable diseases while the NIH funds grant-writing contests.
:::

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### $41,000 PER PATIENT

FDA trials cost 82X more than necessary.

Oxford RECOVERY proved it.
:::

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### 0.06% FUNDING

Medical research gets 0.06% of what we spend treating disease.
:::

::::

:::{.callout-warning}
## THE NIH EMPLOYS TWO ADMINISTRATORS FOR EVERY SCIENTIST

Like having two managers for every McDonald's fry cook.

Except the fries cure cancer and the managers prevent them from being made.

By the time a good idea gets funded, the lead scientist is dead or the disease has evolved thumbs.

## HOW IT WORKS {#how}

::::{.panel-tabset}

### PATIENT CHOICE

**MAKE PATIENT CHOICE SOVEREIGN**

Stop letting committees guess.

Route funding through people who are actually sick.

- **NIH:** 200 bureaucrats predicting the future
- **DIH:** Millions of patients choosing treatments
- Treasury gives subsidies to patients
- Trials that attract patients get funded
- Grant-writing → Market driven by need

### PAY FOR CURES

**PAY FOR RESULTS NOT PAPERWORK**

Eliminate grant applications entirely.

Researchers get paid two ways:

1. **By patients** who join their trials
2. **By bounties** for solving problems

Example: "$1B to reverse aging by 10 years"

Incentives aligned with outcomes, not bureaucracy.

### CODE NOT COMMITTEES

**RUN IT WITH CODE**

Build on smart contracts.

Code can't take bribes.

- Delete the CEO position
- Every rule is code
- Every dollar tracked publicly
- No administrators to corrupt
- Replace bureaucrats with software

### OPEN KNOWLEDGE

**MAKE ALL KNOWLEDGE PUBLIC**

Every trial. Every result. Every dataset.

Published for the world.

- Stops redundant research
- Knowledge compounds
- AI connects researchers
- Finds patterns automatically
- Accelerates discovery

## THE RESULTS

::::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### 80X MORE EFFICIENT

Test 54M patient-treatments for the cost of 658K.

**PROVEN BY OXFORD**
:::

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### 10X FASTER

Treatments in 2-3 years.

Not 17.
:::

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### 100% TRANSPARENT

Every success.

Every failure.

Public knowledge.

**THREE STEPS:**

1. **Fill the Treasury** — [1% Treaty](brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) redirects $27B from military
2. **Let Humanity Decide** — [Wishocracy](brain/book/solution/wishocracy.qmd) sets budget rules
3. **Let Patients Fund Cures** — Subsidies flow to patients who choose trials

## THE CHOICE

**PATH A:** Continue. 55M people die annually. NIH funds grant writers, not cures.

**PATH B:** Build DIH. Replace committees with patients. Replace paperwork with results. Replace bureaucrats with code.

**BUREAUCRACY IS A DISEASE.**

**THE DIH IS THE CURE.**
