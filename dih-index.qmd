## Cure Diseases 80X Faster at 1/82nd the Cost

The NIH spent $1 trillion over 50 years and cured **zero diseases**. The DIH uses markets, not committees, to fund medical research that actually works.

## The Problem We're Solving {#the-problem}

::::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}
### 💀 55M Deaths/Year
People die from treatable diseases while the NIH funds grant-writing contests.
:::

:::{.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}
### 💰 $41,000 per Patient
FDA-regulated trials cost 82X more than necessary (Oxford RECOVERY trial proved it).
:::

:::{.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4}
### 📉 0.06% Funding
Medical research gets 0.06% of the money we spend treating disease.

## The Core Issue: Central Planning Kills

The NIH employs **two administrators for every scientist**—like having two managers for every McDonald's fry cook, except the fries cure cancer and the managers prevent them from being made.

By the time a good idea gets funded, the lead scientist is dead or the disease has evolved thumbs.

## How the DIH Works {#how-it-works}

::::{.panel-tabset}

### Patient Choice

**Make Patient Choice Sovereign**

Stop letting committees guess what might work. Route funding through people who are actually sick.

- The NIH: 200 bureaucrats predicting the future
- **The DIH:** Millions of patients choosing treatments
- Treasury gives subsidies directly to patients
- Trials that attract patients get funded
- Grant-writing contests → markets driven by patient need

### Pay for Cures

**Pay for Results, Not Paperwork**

Eliminate grant applications entirely. Researchers get paid two ways:

1. **By patients** who join their trials
2. **By bounties** for solving defined problems (e.g., "$1B to reverse aging by 10 years")

Align incentives with outcomes, not bureaucratic process.

### Code > Committees

**Run It With Code, Not Committees**

Build on transparent, auditable smart contracts because code can't take bribes.

- Delete the CEO position entirely
- Every rule is code
- Every dollar tracked on public ledger
- No administrators to corrupt
- Replace bureaucrats with software

### Open Knowledge

**Make All Knowledge Public**

Every trial, every result (positive or negative), every dataset gets published.

- Stops redundant research
- Knowledge compounds globally
- AI agents scan data to connect researchers
- Find patterns automatically
- Accelerate discovery for everyone

## The Results {#results}

::::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4 .card}
### 80X More Efficient

Test 54 million patient-treatments for the same cost the NIH uses to test 658,000.

**Proven by Oxford RECOVERY trial**
:::

:::{.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4 .card}
### 10X Faster

Get treatments to patients in 2-3 years, not 17.

**Real-world data, real-time results**
:::

:::{.g-col-12 .g-col-md-4 .card}
### 100% Transparent

Every success and failure becomes public knowledge.

**No hidden data, no buried failures**

## The Three-Step Funding Flow {#funding}

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 8
graph TB
    A[1% Treaty: $27B/year] --> B[DIH Treasury]
    B --> C[Wishocracy: Global Voting]
    C --> D[Patient Subsidies 70%]
    C --> E[Research Prizes 20%]
    C --> F[Infrastructure 10%]
    D --> G[Patients Choose Trials]
    E --> H[Researchers Solve Problems]
    G --> I[Cures & Data]
    H --> I
    I --> J[Humanity Wins]

    style J fill:#000,stroke:#000,color:#fff
```

1. **Fill the Treasury:** The [1% Treaty](brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) redirects $27B from military spending
2. **Let Humanity Decide:** [Wishocracy](brain/book/solution/wishocracy.qmd) allows global voting on budget allocation
3. **Let Patients Fund Cures:** Subsidies flow to patients who choose the best trials

## The dFDA: Your Medical Amazon {#dfda}

The Decentralized FDA gives you what the FDA doesn't:

::::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}
**For Patients:**

- Find treatments ranked by real effectiveness
- Join trials from home with one click
- Get outcome labels for every food and drug
- Personal AI doctor (FDAi Agent) matches you to optimal trials
- Subsidized treatment costs
:::

:::{.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}
**For Researchers:**

- Launch trials in minutes, not years
- Set your own price per patient
- Get paid when patients join
- Real-time results to pivot fast
- No grant applications
:::

## Governance: Nobody in Charge {#governance}

The DIH has no CEO to corrupt. Instead:

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
### Wishocratic Governance

- **Anyone** can propose how to spend funds
- **Everyone** votes through pairwise comparisons
- **AI agents** automate your preferences
- **Smart contracts** execute automatically
- **Public ledger** tracks every dollar
:::

This isn't about trusting people to be good (they won't be). It's about designing a system where being bad is mathematically impossible.

## The Choice

**Path A:** Keep doing what we're doing. 55 million people die annually from preventable diseases. The NIH funds grant writers, not cures.

**Path B:** Build the DIH. Replace committees with patient choice. Replace paperwork with results. Replace bureaucrats with code.

Bureaucracy is a disease. The DIH is the cure.
