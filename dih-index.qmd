## HUMANITY'S STUPIDEST DEATH MACHINE

::::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### 55 MILLION PEOPLE DIE ANNUALLY

That's one Holocaust every 40 days.

While the NIH spends 6 months deciding if Comic Sans is acceptable in grant applications.
:::

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### $41,000 TO TEST ONE DRUG ON ONE PERSON

Oxford proved you can do it for $500.

The other $40,500 goes to paperwork about paperwork.
:::

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### 0.06% OF HEALTHCARE SPENDING ON RESEARCH

Like spending $100,000 on car repairs but 6 cents on not crashing.

Then wondering why you keep crashing.
:::

::::

:::{.callout-warning}
## THE NIH HAS TWO ADMINISTRATORS FOR EVERY SCIENTIST

That's like having two managers watch every McDonald's fry cook.

Except the fries cure cancer. And the managers spend their time writing memos about why the fries shouldn't exist.

By the time they approve a good idea, either the scientist is dead or the disease has evolved opposable thumbs and started its own bureaucracy.

**Bureaucracy is a disease. Here's how you cure it.**
:::

## HOW YOU BUILD A SYSTEM THAT ACTUALLY WORKS {#how}

::::{.panel-tabset}

### LET SICK PEOPLE CHOOSE

**Here's how you stop letting committees guess what works:**

You give money directly to patients. They choose which trials to join. The trials that help people get funded. The ones that don't, die.

This is what replacing bureaucracy looks like:

- **Current System:** 200 bureaucrats in a room guessing what might work (spoiler: they're wrong)
- **Your New System:** Millions of patients voting with their feet
- Give subsidies directly to patients
- They fund trials by joining them
- No grant applications. No committees. No bullshit.

It's like Uber for not dying. Except instead of drunk people rating drivers, sick people fund cures.

### PAY FOR CURES, NOT FICTION

**Here's how you align incentives:**

You delete grant applications entirely. Scientists shouldn't write fiction; they should cure diseases.

Two ways researchers get paid:

1. **Patients join their trials** → Money flows in
2. **They solve a problem** → They collect the bounty

Example bounties:
- "$1 billion to reverse aging by 10 years"
- "$500 million to cure depression without turning people into zombies"
- "$2 billion to make cancer cells remember how to die"

The current system pays for 100-page proposals. Your system pays for not dying.

### REPLACE HUMANS WITH CODE

**Here's how you make corruption mathematically impossible:**

You build everything on smart contracts. Code can't take bribes. Code doesn't need a yacht.

- **Delete the CEO position** (nobody to corrupt = nobody gets corrupted)
- **Every rule is code** (transparent, auditable, unchangeable without consensus)
- **Every dollar tracked publicly** (like a financial colonoscopy for the world to watch)
- **Zero administrators** (their only job is to code themselves out of existence)

This is what happens when you replace bureaucrats with mathematics.

### PUBLISH EVERYTHING OR PEOPLE DIE

**Here's how you stop scientists from hiding failures:**

You mandate total transparency. Every trial, every result, every dataset—published immediately.

What this prevents:
- 50 labs wasting decades on the same dead end
- Pharmaceutical companies burying negative results
- Scientists hoarding data like dragons with lab coats

What this enables:
- AI scanning global data for patterns humans miss
- Knowledge compounding instead of rotting in filing cabinets
- Actual fucking progress

The current system lets knowledge die in drawers. Your system makes ignorance illegal.

## WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DELETE BUREAUCRACY

::::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### 82X CHEAPER

Oxford tested 11,000 patients for what the FDA spends on 134.

That's not a typo. That's what happens when you stop paying lawyers to argue about fonts.
:::

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### 10X FASTER

Get treatments in 2-3 years instead of 17.

By year 17, either you're dead or the disease has a PhD.
:::

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### 100% TRANSPARENT

Every failure published. Every success shared. Every dataset open.

Because hiding knowledge is how you maximize corpses.
:::

::::

## THE PROOF THIS ISN'T DELUSIONAL {#proof}

::::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### OXFORD ALREADY DID IT

The RECOVERY trial tested 11,000 patients for $500 each.

The FDA would have spent $41,000 per patient and taken 17 years.

Oxford did it in months. During a pandemic. While everyone was dying.

[82X cheaper. Proven. Not theoretical.](brain/book/appendix/recovery-trial.qmd)
:::

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### THE MATH THAT BREAKS CALCULATORS

Every $1 invested returns $463 in benefits.

That's better than:
- Smallpox eradication (280:1)
- Childhood vaccines (13:1)
- Selling organs (illegal but only 50:1)

[See the actual math →](brain/book/appendix/dfda-cost-benefit-analysis.qmd)
:::

:::{.g-col-md-4 .card}
### 25,000 LIVES PER YEAR

That's 68 people not dying daily.

Starting immediately.

Exponentially growing as the system scales.

By year 10, death becomes optional.*

*Terms and conditions apply

**HERE'S HOW YOU PAY FOR NOT DYING:**

1. **Steal from the military** — The [1% Treaty](brain/book/solution/1-percent-treaty.qmd) takes a rounding error from bombs, uses it for medicine
2. **Let everyone vote** — [Wishocracy](brain/book/solution/wishocracy.qmd) replaces 200 bureaucrats with 8 billion humans
3. **Give money to sick people** — They fund cures by choosing trials (revolutionary concept: let dying people decide how not to die)

### VICTORY Bonds: How to Get Rich Preventing Death

Investors who fund the campaign get 10% of the $27B annual treaty flow = $2.7B/year = 270% returns forever.

Better than:
- Warren Buffett (20%)
- Real estate (15%)
- S&P 500 (10%)
- Cocaine trafficking (90% but prison)

It's capitalism's redemption arc: greed saving lives.

## THE dFDA: AMAZON FOR NOT DYING

Here's the machine you build to run this system:

::::{.grid}

:::{.g-col-md-6 .card}
### HOW PATIENTS USE IT

- **Find what actually works** (not what pharma companies claim works)
- **Join trials from your couch** (dying is exhausting enough without commuting)
- **See outcome labels** (like nutrition facts, but for not dying)
- **AI matches you to trials** (it's smarter than your doctor and doesn't golf on Wednesdays)
- **Use your subsidies** (government money that actually helps you)
:::

:::{.g-col-md-6 .card}
### HOW RESEARCHERS USE IT

- **Launch a trial in 10 minutes** (not 10 months of paperwork)
- **Set your own price** (capitalism, but for cures)
- **Get paid when patients join** (no grant-writing fiction required)
- **See results in real-time** (not 5 years later in a journal nobody reads)
- **Zero paperwork** (use that time to, you know, cure diseases)

## HOW YOU PREVENT THIS FROM BECOMING THE NIH 2.0

**Make corruption mathematically impossible:**

:::{.callout-note}
### THE WISHOCRACY SYSTEM

Here's how you run a $27 billion treasury without creating another bureaucracy:

- **Anyone can propose** (even you, even your weird uncle)
- **Everyone votes on pairs** ("Do you prefer funding Alzheimer's research or yacht subsidies for administrators?")
- **AI learns preferences** (so you don't vote on 10 million proposals)
- **Smart contracts execute** (code doesn't take bribes)
- **Every dollar tracked publicly** (financial transparency so aggressive it's basically monetary nudism)

The NIH has a CEO who makes $2 million to prevent progress.

Your system has code that can't be bribed, threatened, or invited to pharmaceutical golf tournaments.

## THE DAILY COST OF YOUR PROCRASTINATION

While you read this page:
- **150,000 people died** (that's 50 September 11ths)
- **$327 million burned** on bureaucracy instead of cures
- **Your telomeres got shorter** (you're literally dissolving)
- **Someone's grandma died** from something Oxford could cure for $500

Every day you don't act, this continues.

Tomorrow will be the same. And the next day. And the next.

Until you do something about it.

### IF YOU'RE CONFUSED

Read the whole plan.

It's like IKEA instructions for dismantling death.

:::{.callout-important}
## YOUR TWO OPTIONS

**OPTION A: KEEP THE CURRENT SYSTEM**

- 55 million people die annually (one Holocaust every 40 days)
- The NIH spends $47 billion on bureaucrats who prevent cures
- Treatments take 17 years and $2.6 billion to develop
- Your grandmother dies while someone debates font choices

**OPTION B: BUILD THIS INSTEAD**

- Give money directly to sick people
- Pay scientists for cures, not paperwork  
- Replace committees with code that can't be corrupted
- Reduce trial costs by 82X (proven, not theoretical)

**This isn't a proposal. It's an instruction manual.**

**Bureaucracy kills more people than cancer.**

**Here's how you cure both.**

[READ THE FAQ](brain/book/appendix/faq.qmd) • [ASK QUESTIONS](mailto:contact@dih.earth) • [BUY VICTORY BONDS](brain/book/economics/victory-bonds.qmd)

Built with [Quarto](https://quarto.org) because WordPress causes cancer • Code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mikepsinn/decentralized-institutes-of-health) because transparency prevents corruption

**Remember: Every day you don't build this, 150,000 people die.**

**That's one Holocaust every 40 days.**

**No pressure.**
