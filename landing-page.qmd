# The Complete Idiot's Guide to<br>Ending War and Disease

## This is a practical guide to tricking humanity into not killing itself.

Everyone wants stuff. The problem is, we only have so much stuff to make stuff with. And right now, we're using most of it to blow each other up.

**We spend $119 trillion annually on war and disease.**<br>
**That's like setting fire to 119 trillion dollar bills every year while complaining about being cold.**
:::

## The $119T Death Toilet

Imagine humanity as a corporation. The security department spends a quarter of the budget shooting up the accounting department. The medical department watches everyone die while spending its budget on Band-Aids. The CEO is drunk. The board is playing golf.

Welcome to Earth, Inc.

### Humanity's Deranged Family Budget

| What We Buy | Annual Cost | Translation for Idiots |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Disease (watching people rot)** | $109.1 Trillion | Everyone you love slowly dissolving while you pay to watch |
| **War (professional murder)** | $9.7 Trillion | Turning children into skeletons for fun and profit |
| **Medical research (finding cures)** | $0.068 Trillion | **A rounding error. LOL.** |

If humanity's budget was a family making $100,000/year:

- Healthcare (treating symptoms): $8,200
- Military (home defense): $2,700  
- Medical research (finding cures): **$68**

### The Daily Holocaust of Inaction

While you read this sentence, 17 people died from preventable diseases. By the time you finish this page, over 150,000 will be gone. That's a small city. Deleted.

- Every second: $196,900 spent on war instead of cures
- Every heartbeat: Someone dies of something curable
- Every time you blink: $590,700 flushed down the death toilet
:::

## The Second-Best Idea That Might Actually Work

Take just **1%** of the murder budget. One percent. A rounding error. A Pentagon couch cushion's worth.

That's $27 billion a year.

We'd still have $2.69 trillion left for killing. [Enough to murder everyone on Earth 20 times](brain/reference/nuclear-weapon-cost-and-casualties.md). (Current population: 8 billion. Murder capacity: 158.4 billion. We're overachievers.)

### The Secret: Make Greed Work for Good

The military-industrial complex spends $1 on lobbying and gets **$1,813 back** in contracts. It's the best investment in the world, if you don't mind the screaming.

The strategy does the exact same thing, but backwards.

**Step 1:** Sell VICTORY Bonds to raise $1 billion (270% returns).

**Step 2:** Use the money to run a massive campaign to get 3.5% of humanity (280M people) to vote for the 1% Treaty.

**Step 3:** Spend $1 billion on completely legal bribes (lobbying).

**Step 4:** Watch politicians suddenly discover they've always cared about curing cancer.

### The Current System (Stupid)
- $2.2 billion to develop one drug
- 17 years from "eureka!" to "take two and call me"
- 95% of diseases have zero approved treatments
- 85% of patients can't join trials
- Everyone dies while waiting
:::
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.card .inverted}
### The New System (Works)
- ~$27 million per treatment (82X cheaper)
- 2-3 years from idea to medicine
- Every disease gets attention
- Amazon-style marketplace
- Your EHR suggests trials
- Fewer people die while bureaucrats debate

## Your Brain Wants You Dead (Evolution's Greatest Prank)

### Why We're Like This

You're not actually stupid. You're just a meat robot programmed by dead people's DNA.

Your brain evolved to:
- Run from tigers (none left, you killed them all)
- Find berries (now in aisle 3, next to the diabetes)
- Care about 150 people max (everyone else can die)
- Fear different tribes (now we have nukes, what could go wrong?)

That's why you fear terrorism (kills 25,000/year) more than heart disease (kills 18 million/year).

**Princeton proved it:** Zero correlation between what you want and what happens. You have as much political power as your houseplant.

### Wishocracy
Democracy that actually works. Instead of 535 people pretending to represent 335 million, everyone makes tiny decisions that add up. Like Facebook figured out how to make you click ads, but for curing diseases.

### dFDA
Amazon meets Consumer Reports for not dying. Browse treatments like shopping. Read actual patient reviews. One-click join from your doctor's iPad. Competition drives costs from $41,000 to $500 per patient.

### DIH
NIH is literally Soviet science. DIH replaces committees with markets. Think Y Combinator + Kickstarter + Bitcoin for medical research. Pay for results, not proposals.

### VICTORY Bonds offer 270% annual returns.

That's not a typo. Two hundred seventy percent.

Better than:
- Warren Buffett (20%)
- Index funds (10%)
- Your cousin's crypto scheme (-100%)

**Here's how:** Invest $1 billion to redirect $27 billion annually. That's a 27:1 ratio every year forever.

### The Coalition of the Willing (To Get Rich While Saving Humanity)

**Defense Contractors**: "Wait, we can make 270% returns instead of 8% margins? And keep 99% of our military budget? Where do we sign?"

**Insurance Companies**: Every cure = billions they don't pay out. Finally, aligned incentives!

**Big Pharma**: Instead of burning $48,000 per patient in trials, patients now PAY THEM. From biggest expense to revenue stream.

**Politicians**: Create Super PACs. Vote for the treaty or face opponents funded with bar graphs showing you hate grandmas with cancer.

**Billionaires**: 270% returns AND ending human suffering.

It's capitalism, but pointed at not dying.

### Idiocracy (if we keep funding war)

**The Three Subs:**
- 🧠 **Sub-Intelligence**: IQ dropping, eating lead paint for nutrients
- ⏳ **Sub-Longevity**: Life expectancy 35, dying of scurvy like a pirate
- 😢 **Sub-Wellbeing**: 80% mentally ill, happiness is illegal

**Your Life:**
- Nuclear winter by 2050
- Diet: Bugs and bunker rations
- Entertainment: Fighting over water
- WiFi: Terrible
- Status: Mad Max but with worse teeth

Your kid gets diagnosed with something unpronounceable. You sell your house, start a GoFundMe, watch her die anyway.

**The Three Supers:**
- 🧠 **Super-Intelligence**: IQ unlimited, understand Rick & Morty
- ⏳ **Super-Longevity**: Death optional, backups available
- 😊 **Super-Wellbeing**: Suffering extinct, bliss on tap

**Your Life:**
- Death defeated by 2050
- Life expectancy: "Yes"
- Disease: In museums next to smallpox
- War: "That thing where people murdered each other? Weird."
- WiFi: Telepathic
- Status: Star Trek but with better writing

Your kid gets diagnosed. Doctor uploads DNA, computer designs cure, pharmacy prints it, she's fine by Thursday. Cost: $0.

## The Conclusion

Humanity spends $118.8 trillion a year o

The treaty asks for 1% of the military budget. To cure the diseases that are going to kill you, your parents, your children, and everyone you've ever loved.

The military will still have 99% of its budget. [That's enough to kill everyone in the world 19 times instead of 20](brain/reference/nuclear-weapon-cost-and-casualties.md).

This isn't liberal or conservative. It's not capitalism or socialism. **It's math.**

The people in charge aren't evil. They're just following incentives. Change the incentives. Make saving lives more profitable than ending them.

### Do you want to die of something preventable, or would you rather not?
