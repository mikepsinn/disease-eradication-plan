> **The 1% Treaty:** Every nation redirects just 1% of global military spending to fund 80X more efficient medical research, creating the most profitable investment in history while saving millions of lives.

## The Problem in Numbers

| What We Waste Money On | Annual Cost | What We Get |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| War & Conflict | $9.7T | Destruction, refugees, and disabilities |
| Disease Burden | $109.1T | Suffering and lost potential |
| **Total Waste** | **$118.8T** | **The dumbest possible use of our limited resources** |
| **Medical Research** | **$0.068T** | Actual cures and treatments |

## The 1% Solution

We've created a system where:

1. **Nations redirect 1%** of military budgets to cure disease
2. **Patients get paid** to participate in clinical trials
3. **Research becomes 80x more efficient** using proven methods
4. **EVERYONE profits** from the $16.5T annual peace dividend

[How It Works](#how-it-works) | [The Math](#the-math) | [Get Involved](#join-the-war)

## Why This Works

✅ **Proven Model:** The Oxford RECOVERY trial showed we can run trials for $500 instead of $41,000 per patient  
✅ **Massive Leverage:** $1 in lobbying produces $1,813 in government contracts
✅ **Aligned Incentives:** Everyone gets rich by curing disease instead of killing people and  
✅ **No Losers:** Even partial success means 1% less war and nuclear bombs and more cures

## How It Works

### The 6-Step Process

1. **Get the Money**: The 1% Treaty redirects $27B/year from weapons to cures
2. **Allocate Efficiently**: The DIH uses democratic voting to fund what matters most  
3. **Pay Patients**: Subsidies go directly to patients who join trials
4. **Run Cheap Trials**: Pragmatic trials cost $500/patient instead of $41,000
5. **Publish Everything**: The dFDA shows real effectiveness data for every treatment
6. **Outcome Labels**: Every food and drug gets honest labels about what it actually does

### Current System vs. New System

**Current System:**
- $2.2B to develop one new treatment
- 17 years from discovery to patients  
- 95% of diseases have 0 FDA-approved treatments 

**New System:**
- ~$27M to develop one new treatment (80X cheaper)
- 2-3 years from discovery to patients 
- 1,000X more treatments tested with same global budget
- Every disease gets attention (patients pay to participate)

## The Math

### Investment Required vs. Returns

**Total Implementation Cost:** $1.2-2.5B over 36 months

**Annual Returns Once Operational:** $27B+ per year from 1% military budget redirections

**The Math:** We're asking for $2.5B to redirect $27B annually. That's a 10:1 return ratio - better than most venture capital investments, except this one saves millions of lives.

## The Plan: From Idea to Treaty

1.  **Prove the Mandate (The Global Referendum):** We will mobilize 3.5% of humanity (280 million people) through a global referendum. This creates an undeniable political mandate that no leader can ignore.

2.  **Fund the Mission (VICTORY Bonds):** We will raise the required $2.5B by selling **VICTORY Bonds**—an investment vehicle designed to offer ~40% annual returns, making peace more profitable than war.

3.  **Ratify the Treaty:** With a clear public mandate and a powerful financial engine, we will co-opt the existing political system to ratify the 1% Treaty and begin redirecting funds.
