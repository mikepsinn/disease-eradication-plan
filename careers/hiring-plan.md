# Hiring Plan & Team Roadmap

This document provides a detailed breakdown of the team structure and hiring roadmap, justifying the headcount figures presented in the [Operational Budget & Financial Model](../economic-models/operational-budget-and-financial-model.md).

Our strategy is to build a lean, world-class core team for direct execution and to aggressively leverage contractors, prize-based competitions, and partner organizations to scale our impact without a large, bureaucratic overhead.

## Compensation Philosophy
All core team members will receive modest, market-rate cash salaries combined with large, vested grants of `$VICTORY` tokens. This approach preserves cash for high-leverage political and technical spending while deeply aligning the team's long-term financial success with the success of the mission.
